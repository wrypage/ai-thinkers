PREFACE.

   ----0----

   Of all the promises connected with the command, ABIDE IN ME,' there is
   none higher, and none that sooner brings the confession, Not that I
   have already attained, or am already made perfect,' than this: If ye
   abide in me,  ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.'
     Power with God is the highest attainment of the life of full abiding.

   And of all the traits of a life LIKE CHRIST there is none higher and
   more glorious than conformity to Him in the work that now engages Him
   without ceasing in the Father's presence--His all-prevailing
   intercession.  The more we abide in Him, and grow unto His likeness,
   will His priestly life work in us mightily, and our life become what
   His is, a life that ever pleads and prevails for men.

   Thou hast made us kings and priests unto God.'  Both in the king and
   the priest the chief thing is power, influence, blessing.  In the king
   it is the power coming downward; in the priest, the power rising
   upward, prevailing with God.  In our blessed Priest-King, Jesus Christ,
   the kingly power is founded on the priestly He is able to save to the
   uttermost, because He ever liveth to make intercession.'  In us, His
   priests and kings, it is no otherwise:  it is in intercession that the
   Church is to find and wield its highest power, that each member of the
   Church is to prove his descent from Israel, who as a prince had power
   with God and with men, and prevailed.

   It is under a deep impression that the place and power of prayer in the
   Christian life is too little understood, that this book has been
   written.  I feel sure that as long as we look on prayer chiefly as the
   means of maintaining our own Christian life, we shall not know fully
   what it is meant to be.  But when we learn to regard it as the highest
   part of the work entrusted to us, the root and strength of all other
   work, we shall see that there is nothing that we so need to study and
   practise as the art of praying aright.  If I have at all succeeded in
   pointing out the progressive teaching of our Lord in regard to prayer,
   and the distinct reference the wonderful promises of the last night
   (John xiv. 16) have to the works we are to do in His Name, to the
   greater works, and to the bearing much fruit, we shall all admit that
   it is only when the Church gives herself up to this holy work of
   intercession that we can expect the power of Christ to manifest itself
   in her behalf.  It is my prayer that God may use this little book to
   make clearer to some of His children the wonderful place of power and
   influence which He is waiting for them to occupy, and for which a weary
   world is waiting too.

   In connection with this there is another truth that has come to me with
   wonderful clearness as I studied the teaching of Jesus on prayer.  It
   is this:  that the Father waits to hear every prayer of faith, to give
   us whatsoever we will, and whatsoever we ask in Jesus' name.  We have
   become so accustomed to limit the wonderful love and the large promises
   of our God, that we cannot read the simplest and clearest statements of
   our Lord without the qualifying clauses by which we guard and expound
   them.  If there is one thing I think the Church needs to learn, it is
   that God means prayer to have an answer, and that it hath not entered
   into the heart of man to conceive what God will do for His child who
   gives himself to believe that his prayer will be heard.   God hears
   prayer; this is a truth universally admitted, but of which very few
   understand the meaning, or experience the power.  If what I have
   written stir my reader to go to the Master's words, and take His
   wondrous promises simply and literally as they stand, my object has
   been attained.

   And then just one thing more.  Thousands have in these last years found
   an unspeakable blessing in learning how completely Christ is our life,
   and how He undertakes to be and to do all in us that we need.  I know
   not if we have yet learned to apply this truth to our prayer-life. Many
   complain that they have not the power to pray in faith, to pray the
   effectual prayer that availeth much.  The message I would fain bring
   them is that the blessed Jesus is waiting, is longing, to teach them
   this.  Christ is our life:  in heaven He ever liveth to pray; His life
   in us is an ever-praying life, if we will but trust Him for it.  Christ
   teaches us to pray not only by example, by instruction, by command, by
   promises, but by showing us HIMSELF, the ever-living Intercessor, as
   our Life.  It is when we believe this, and go and abide in Him for our
   prayer-life too, that our fears of not being able to pray aright will
   vanish, and we shall joyfully and triumphantly trust our Lord to teach
   us to pray, to be Himself the life and the power of our prayer.

   May God open our eyes to see what the holy ministry of intercession is
   to which, as His royal priesthood, we have been set apart.  May He give
   us a large and strong heart to believe what mighty influence our
   prayers can exert.  And may all fear as to our being able to fulfil our
   vocation vanish as we see Jesus, living ever to pray, living in us to
   pray, and standing surety for our prayer-life.

FIRST LESSON.

  Lord, teach us to pray;'

  Or,    The Only Teacher .

   And it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, that when He
   ceased, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to
   pray.'--Luke xi. 1.

   THE disciples had been with Christ, and seen Him pray.  They had learnt
   to understand something of the connection between His wondrous life in
   public, and His secret life of prayer.  They had learnt to believe in
   Him as a Master in the art of prayer--none could pray like Him.  And so
   they came to Him with the request, Lord, teach us to pray.'  And in
   after years they would have told us that there were few things more
   wonderful or blessed that He taught them than His lessons on prayer.

   And now still it comes to pass, as He is praying in a certain place,
   that disciples who see Him thus engaged feel the need of repeating the
   same request, Lord, teach us to pray.'   As we grow in the Christian
   life, the thought and the faith of the Beloved Master in His
   never-failing intercession becomes ever more precious, and the hope of
   being Like Christ in His intercession gains an attractiveness before
   unknown.  And as we see Him pray, and remember that there is none who
   can pray like Him, and none who can teach like Him, we feel the
   petition of the disciples, Lord, teach us to pray,' is just what we
   need.  And as we think how all He is and has, how He Himself is our
   very own, how He is Himself our life, we feel assured that we have but
   to ask, and He will be delighted to take us up into closer fellowship
   with Himself, and teach us to pray even as He prays.

   Come, my brothers!  Shall we not go to the Blessed Master and ask Him
   to enrol our names too anew in that school which He always keeps open
   for those who long to continue their studies in the Divine art of
   prayer and intercession?  Yes, let us this very day say to the Master,
   as they did of old, Lord, teach us to pray.'  As we meditate, we shall
   find each word of the petition we bring to be full of meaning.

   Lord, teach us to pray.'  Yes, to pray.  This is what we need to be
   taught.  Though in its beginnings prayer is so simple that the feeblest
   child can pray, yet it is at the same time the highest and holiest work
   to which man can rise.   It is fellowship with the Unseen and Most Holy
   One.  The powers of the eternal world have been placed at its
   disposal.  It is the very essence of true religion, the channel of all
   blessings, the secret of power and life.  Not only for ourselves, but
   for others, for the Church, for the world, it is to prayer that God has
   given the right to take hold of Him and His strength.  It is on prayer
   that the promises wait for their fulfilment, the kingdom for its
   coming, the glory of God for its full revelation.  And for this blessed
   work, how slothful and unfit we are.  It is only the Spirit of God can
   enable us to do it aright.  How speedily we are deceived into a resting
   in the form, while the power is wanting.  Our early training, the
   teaching of the Church, the influence of habit, the stirring of the
   emotions--how easily these lead to prayer which has no spiritual power,
   and avails but little.  True prayer, that takes hold of God's strength,
   that availeth much, to which the gates of heaven are really opened
   wide--who would not cry, Oh for some one to teach me thus to pray?

   Jesus has opened a school, in which He trains His redeemed ones, who
   specially desire it, to have power in prayer.  Shall we not enter it
   with the petition, Lord! it is just this we need to be taught! O teach
   us to pray.

   Lord, teach us to pray.'  Yes, us, Lord.  We have read in Thy Word with
   what power Thy believing people of old used to pray, and what mighty
   wonders were done in answer to their prayers.  And if this took place
   under the Old Covenant, in the time of preparation, how much more wilt
   Thou not now, in these days of fulfilment, give Thy people this sure
   sign of Thy presence in their midst.  We have heard the promises given
   to Thine apostles of the power of prayer in Thy name, and have seen how
   gloriously they experienced their truth:  we know for certain, they can
   become true to us too.  We hear continually even in these days what
   glorious tokens of Thy power Thou dost still give to those who trust
   Thee fully.  Lord! these all are men of like passions with ourselves;
   teach us to pray so too.  The promises are for us, the powers and gifts
   of the heavenly world are for us.  O teach us to pray so that we may
   receive abundantly.  To us too Thou hast entrusted Thy work, on our
   prayer too the coming of Thy kingdom depends, in our prayer too Thou
   canst glorify Thy name; Lord teach us to pray.'  Yes, us, Lord; we
   offer ourselves as learners; we would indeed be taught of Thee.  Lord,
   teach us to pray.'

   Lord, teach us to pray.'  Yes, we feel the need now of being taught to
   pray.  At first there is no work appears so simple; later on, none that
   is more difficult; and the confession is forced from us:  We know not
   how to pray as we ought.  It is true we have God's Word, with its clear
   and sure promises; but sin has so darkened our mind, that we know not
   always how to apply the word.  In spiritual things we do not always
   seek the most needful things, or fail in praying according to the law
   of the sanctuary.  In temporal things we are still less able to avail
   ourselves of the wonderful liberty our Father has given us to ask what
   we need.  And even when we know what to ask, how much there is still
   needed to make prayer acceptable.  It must be to the glory of God, in
   full surrender to His will, in full assurance of faith, in the name of
   Jesus, and with a perseverance that, if need be, refuses to be denied.
   All this must be learned.  It can only be learned in the school of much
   prayer, for practice makes perfect.  Amid the painful consciousness of
   ignorance and unworthiness, in the struggle between believing and
   doubting, the heavenly art of effectual prayer is learnt.  Because,
   even when we do not remember it, there is One, the Beginner and
   Finisher of faith and prayer, who watches over our praying, and sees to
   it that in all who trust Him for it their education in the school of
   prayer shall be carried on to perfection.  Let but the deep undertone
   of all our prayer be the teachableness that comes from a sense of
   ignorance, and from faith in Him as a perfect teacher, and we may be
   sure we shall be taught, we shall learn to pray in power.  Yes, we may
   depend upon it, He teaches to pray.

   Lord, teach us to pray.'  None can teach like Jesus, none but Jesus;
   therefore we call on Him, LORD, teach us to pray.'  A pupil needs a
   teacher, who knows his work, who has the gift of teaching, who in
   patience and love will descend to the pupil's needs.  Blessed be God!
   Jesus is all this and much more.  He knows what prayer is.  It is
   Jesus, praying Himself, who teaches to pray.  He knows what prayer is.
   He learned it amid the trials and tears of His earthly life.  In heaven
   it is still His beloved work:  His life there is prayer.  Nothing
   delights Him more than to find those whom He can take with Him into the
   Father's presence, whom He can clothe with power to pray down God's
   blessing on those around them, whom He can train to be His
   fellow-workers in the intercession by which the kingdom is to be
   revealed on earth.  He knows how to teach.  Now by the urgency of felt
   need, then by the confidence with which joy inspires.  Here by the
   teaching of the Word, there by the testimony of another believer who
   knows what it is to have prayer heard.  By His Holy Spirit, He has
   access to our heart, and teaches us to pray by showing us the sin that
   hinders the prayer, or giving us the assurance that we please God.  He
   teaches, by giving not only thoughts of what to ask or how to ask, but
   by breathing within us the very spirit of prayer, by living within us
   as the Great Intercessor.  We may indeed and most joyfully say, Who
   teacheth like Him?'  Jesus never taught His disciples how to preach,
   only how to pray.  He did not speak much of what was needed to preach
   well, but much of praying well.  To know how to speak to God is more
   than knowing how to speak to man.  Not power with men, but power with
   God is the first thing.  Jesus loves to teach us how to pray.

   What think you, my beloved fellow-disciples! would it not be just what
   we need, to ask the Master for a month to give us a course of special
   lessons on the art of prayer?  As we meditate on the words He spake on
   earth, let us yield ourselves to His teaching in the fullest confidence
   that, with such a teacher, we shall make progress.  Let us take time
   not only to meditate, but to pray, to tarry at the foot of the throne,
   and be trained to the work of intercession.  Let us do so in the
   assurance that amidst our stammerings and fears He is carrying on His
   work most beautifully.  He will breathe His own life, which is all
   prayer, into us.  As He makes us partakers of His righteousness and His
   life, He will of His intercession too.  As the members of His body, as
   a holy priesthood, we shall take part in His priestly work of pleading
   and prevailing with God for men.  Yes, let us most joyfully say,
   ignorant and feeble though we be, Lord, teach us to pray.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord! who ever livest to pray, Thou canst teach me too to pray,
   me too to live ever to pray.  In this Thou lovest to make me share Thy
   glory in heaven, that I should pray without ceasing, and ever stand as
   a priest in the presence of my God.

   Lord Jesus!   I ask Thee this day to enrol my name among those who
   confess that they know not how to pray as they ought, and specially ask
   Thee for a course of teaching in prayer.  Lord! teach me to tarry with
   Thee in the school, and give Thee time to train me.  May a deep sense
   of my ignorance, of the wonderful privilege and power of prayer, of the
   need of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of prayer, lead me to cast away
   my thoughts of what I think I know, and make me kneel before Thee in
   true teachableness and poverty of spirit.

   And fill me, Lord, with the confidence that with such a teacher as Thou
   art I shall learn to pray.  In the assurance that I have as my teacher,
   Jesus who is ever praying to the Father, and by His prayer rules the
   destinies of His Church and the world, I will not be afraid.  As much
   as I need to know of the mysteries of the prayer-world, Thou wilt
   unfold for me.  And when I may not know, Thou wilt teach me to be
   strong in faith, giving glory to God.

   Blessed Lord! Thou wilt not put to shame Thy scholar who trusts Thee,
   nor, by Thy grace, would he Thee either.  Amen.

SECOND LESSON.

  In spirit and truth.'

  Or,    The True Worshippers.

   The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship
   the Father in spirit and truth:  for such doth the Father seek to be
   His worshippers.  God is a Spirit:  and they that worship Him must
   worship Him in spirit and truth.'--John iv. 23, 24.

   THESE words of Jesus to the woman of Samaria are His first recorded
   teaching on the subject of prayer.  They give us some wonderful first
   glimpses into the world of prayer.  The Father seeks worshippers:  our
   worship satisfies His loving heart and is a joy to Him.  He seeks true
   worshippers, but finds many not such as He would have them.  True
   worship is that which is in spirit and truth.  The Son has come to open
   the way for this worship in spirit and in truth, and teach it us.  And
   so one of our first lessons in the school of prayer must be to
   understand what it is to pray in spirit and in truth, and to know how
   we can attain to it.

   To the woman of Samaria our Lord spoke of a threefold worship.  There
   is first, the ignorant worship of the Samaritans:  Ye worship that
   which ye know not.'  The second, the intelligent worship of the Jew,
   having the true knowledge of God: We worship that which we know; for
   salvation is of the Jews.'  And then the new, the spiritual worship
   which He Himself has come to introduce:  The hour is coming, and is
   now, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and
   truth.'  From the connection it is evident that the words in spirit and
   truth' do not mean, as is often thought, earnestly, from the heart, in
   sincerity.  The Samaritans had the five books of Moses and some
   knowledge of God; there was doubtless more than one among them who
   honestly and earnestly sought God in prayer.  The Jews had the true
   full revelation of God in His word, as thus far given; there were among
   them godly men, who called upon God with their whole heart.  And yet
   not in spirit and truth,' in the full meaning of the words.  Jesus
   says, The hour is coming, and now is;' it is only in and through Him
   that the worship of God will be in spirit and truth.

   Among Christians one still finds the three classes of worshippers.
   Some who in their ignorance hardly know what they ask:  they pray
   earnestly, and yet receive but little.  Others there are, who have more
   correct knowledge, who try to pray with all their mind and heart, and
   often pray most earnestly, and yet do not attain to the full
   blessedness of worship in spirit and truth.  It is into this third
   class we must ask our Lord Jesus to take us; we must be taught of Him
   how to worship in spirit and truth.  This alone is spiritual worship;
   this makes us worshippers such as the Father seeks.  In prayer
   everything will depend on our understanding well and practising the
   worship in spirit and truth.

   God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him, must worship Him in spirit
   and truth.'  The first thought suggested here by the Master is that
   there must be harmony between God and His worshippers; such as God is,
   must His worship be.  This is according to a principle which prevails
   throughout the universe:  we look for correspondence between an object
   and the organ to which it reveals or yields itself.  The eye has an
   inner fitness for the light, the ear for sound.  The man who would
   truly worship God, would find and know and possess and enjoy God, must
   be in harmony with Him, must have the capacity for receiving Him.
   Because God is Spirit, we must worship in spirit.  As God is, so His
   worshipper.

   And what does this mean?  The woman had asked our Lord whether Samaria
   or Jerusalem was the true place of worship.  He answers that henceforth
   worship is no longer to be limited to a certain place:  Woman, believe
   Me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem,
   shall ye worship the Father.'  As God is Spirit, not bound by space or
   time, but in His infinite perfection always and everywhere the same, so
   His worship would henceforth no longer be confined by place or form,
   but spiritual as God Himself is spiritual.  A lesson of deep
   importance.  How much our Christianity suffers from this, that it is
   confined to certain times and places.  A man, who seeks to pray
   earnestly in the church or in the closet, spends the greater part of
   the week or the day in a spirit entirely at variance with that in which
   he prayed.  His worship was the work of a fixed place or hour, not of
   his whole being.  God is a Spirit:  He is the Everlasting and
   Unchangeable One; what He is, He is always and in truth.  Our worship
   must even so be in spirit and truth:  His worship must be the spirit of
   our life; our life must be worship in spirit as God is Spirit.

   God is a Spirit:  and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit
   and truth.'  The second thought that comes to us is that the worship in
   the spirit must come from God Himself.  God is Spirit:  He alone has
   Spirit to give.  It was for this He sent His Son, to fit us for such
   spiritual worship, by giving us the Holy Spirit.  It is of His own work
   that Jesus speaks when He says twice, The hour cometh,' and then adds,
   and is now.'  He came to baptize with the Holy Spirit; the Spirit could
   not stream forth till He was glorified (John i. 33, vii. 37, 38, xvi.
   7).  It was when He had made an end of sin, and entering into the
   Holiest of all with His blood, had there on our behalf received the
   Holy Spirit (Acts ii. 33), that He could send Him down to us as the
   Spirit of the Father.  It was when Christ had redeemed us, and we in
   Him had received the position of children, that the Father sent forth
   the Spirit of His Son into our hearts to cry, Abba, Father.'  The
   worship in spirit is the worship of the Father in the Spirit of Christ
   , the Spirit of Sonship.

   This is the reason why Jesus here uses the name of Father.  We never
   find one of the Old Testament saints personally appropriate the name of
   child or call God his Father.  The worship of the Father is only
   possible to those to whom the Spirit of the Son has been given.  The
   worship in  spirit is only possible to those to whom the Son has
   revealed the Father, and who have received the spirit of Sonship.  It
   is only Christ who opens the way and teaches the worship in spirit.

   And in truth.  That does not only mean, in sincerity.  Nor does it only
   signify, in accordance with the truth of God's Word.  The expression is
   one of deep and Divine meaning.  Jesus is the only-begotten of the
   Father, full of grace and truth.'  The law was given by Moses; grace
   and truth came by Jesus Christ.'  Jesus says, I am the truth and the
   life.'  In the Old Testament all was shadow and promise; Jesus brought
   and gives the reality, the substance, of things hoped for.  In Him the
   blessings and powers of the eternal life are our actual possession and
   experience.  Jesus is full of grace and truth; the Holy Spirit is the
   Spirit of truth; through Him the grace that is in Jesus is ours in deed
   and truth, a positive communication out of the Divine life.  And so
   worship in spirit is worship in truth; actual living fellowship with
   God, a real correspondence and harmony between the Father, who is a
   Spirit, and the child praying in the spirit.

   What Jesus said to the woman of Samaria, she could not at once
   understand.  Pentecost was needed to reveal its full meaning.  We are
   hardly prepared at our first entrance into the school of prayer to
   grasp such teaching.  We shall understand it better later on.  Let us
   only begin and take the lesson as He gives it.  We are carnal and
   cannot bring God the worship He seeks.  But Jesus came to give the
   Spirit:  He has given Him to us.  Let the disposition in which we set
   ourselves to pray be what Christ's words have taught us.  Let there be
   the deep confession of our inability to bring God the worship that is
   pleasing to Him; the childlike teachableness that waits on Him to
   instruct us; the simple faith that yields itself to the breathing of
   the Spirit.  Above all, let us hold fast the blessed truth--we shall
   find that the Lord has more to say to us about it--that the knowledge
   of the Fatherhood of God, the revelation of His infinite Fatherliness
   in our hearts, the faith in the infinite love that gives us His Son and
   His Spirit to make us children, is indeed the secret of prayer in
   spirit and truth.  This is the new and living way Christ opened up for
   us.  To have Christ the Son, and the Spirit of the Son, dwelling within
   us, and revealing the Father, this makes us true, spiritual
   worshippers.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord!  I adore the love with which Thou didst teach a woman,
   who had refused Thee a cup of water, what the worship of God must be.
   I rejoice in the assurance that Thou wilt no less now instruct Thy
   disciple, who comes to Thee with a heart that longs to pray in spirit
   and in truth.  O my Holy Master!  do teach me this blessed secret.

   Teach me that the worship in spirit and truth is not of man, but only
   comes from Thee; that it is not only a thing of times and seasons, but
   the outflowing of a life in Thee.  Teach me to draw near to God in
   prayer under the deep impression of my ignorance and my having nothing
   in myself to offer Him, and at the same time of the provision Thou, my
   Saviour, makest for the Spirit's breathing in my childlike
   stammerings.  I do bless Thee that in Thee I am a child, and have a
   child's liberty of access; that in Thee I have the spirit of Sonship
   and of worship in truth.  Teach me, above all, Blessed Son of the
   Father, how it is the revelation of the Father that gives confidence in
   prayer; and let the infinite Fatherliness of God's Heart be my joy and
   strength for a life of prayer and of  worship.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

THIRD LESSON.

  Pray to thy Father, which is in secret;'

  Or,    Alone with God.

   But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having
   shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father
   which seeth in secret shall recompense thee'--Matt. vi. 6.

   AFTER Jesus had called His first disciples, He gave them their first
   public teaching in the Sermon on the Mount.  He there expounded to them
   the kingdom of God, its laws and its life.  In that kingdom God is not
   only King, but Father, He not only gives all, but is Himself all.  In
   the knowledge and fellowship of Him alone is its blessedness.  Hence it
   came as a matter of course that the revelation of prayer and the
   prayer-life was a part of His teaching concerning the New Kingdom He
   came to set up.  Moses gave neither command nor regulation with regard
   to prayer:  even the prophets say little directly of the duty of
   prayer; it is Christ who teaches to pray.

   And the first thing the Lord teaches His disciples is that they must
   have a secret place for prayer; every one must have some solitary spot
   where he can be alone with his God.  Every teacher must have a
   schoolroom.  We have learnt to know and accept Jesus as our only
   teacher in the school of prayer.  He has already taught us at Samaria
   that worship is no longer confined to times and places; that worship,
   spiritual true worship, is a thing of the spirit and the life; the
   whole man must in his whole life be worship in spirit and truth.  And
   yet He wants each one to choose for himself the fixed spot where He can
   daily meet him.  That inner chamber, that solitary place, is Jesus'
   schoolroom.  That spot may be anywhere; that spot may change from day
   to day if we have to change our abode; but that secret place there must
   be, with the quiet time in which the pupil places himself in the
   Master's presence, to be by Him prepared to worship the Father.  There
   alone, but there most surely, Jesus comes to us to teach us to pray.

   A teacher is always anxious that his schoolroom should be bright and
   attractive, filled with the light and air of heaven, a place where
   pupils long to come, and love to stay.  In His first words on prayer in
   the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus seeks to set the inner chamber before us
   in its most attractive light.  If we listen carefully, we soon notice
   what the chief thing is He has to tell us of our tarrying there.  Three
   times He uses the name of Father:  Pray to thy Father;'  Thy Father
   shall recompense thee;' Your Father knoweth what things ye have need
   of.'  The first thing in closet-prayer is:  I must meet my Father.  The
   light that shines in the closet must be:  the light of the Father's
   countenance.  The fresh air from heaven with which Jesus would have it
   filled, the atmosphere in which I am to breathe and pray, is:  God's
   Father-love, God's infinite Fatherliness.  Thus each thought or
   petition we breathe out will be simple, hearty, childlike trust in the
   Father.  This is how the Master teaches us to pray:  He brings us into
   the Father's living presence.  What we pray there must avail.  Let us
   listen carefully to hear what the Lord has to say to us.

   First, Pray to thy Father which is in secret.'  God is a God who hides
   Himself to the carnal eye.  As long as in our worship of God we are
   chiefly occupied with our own thoughts and exercises, we shall not meet
   Him who is a Spirit, the unseen One.  But to the man who withdraws
   himself from all that is of the world and man, and prepares to wait
   upon God alone, the Father will reveal Himself.  As he forsakes and
   gives up and shuts out the world, and the life of the world, and
   surrenders himself to be led of Christ into the secret of God's
   presence, the light of the Father's love will rise upon him.  The
   secrecy of the inner chamber and the closed door, the entire separation
   from all around us, is an image of, and so a help to that inner
   spiritual sanctuary, the secret of God's tabernacle, within the veil,
   where our spirit truly comes into contact with the Invisible One.  And
   so we are taught, at the very outset of our search after the secret of
   effectual prayer, to remember that it is in the inner chamber, where we
   are alone with the Father, that we shall learn to pray aright.  The
   Father is in secret:  in these words Jesus teaches us where He is
   waiting us, where He is always to be found.  Christians often complain
   that private prayer is not what it should be.  They feel weak and
   sinful, the heart is cold and dark; it is as if they have so little to
   pray, and in that little no faith or joy.  They are discouraged and
   kept from prayer by the thought that they cannot come to the Father as
   they ought or as they wish.  Child of God!  listen to your Teacher.  He
   tells you that when you go to private prayer your first thought must
   be:  The Father is in secret, the Father waits me there.  Just because
   your heart is cold and prayerless, get you into the presence of the
   loving Father.  As a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth
   you.  Do not be thinking of how little you have to bring God, but of
   how much He wants to give you.  Just place yourself before, and look up
   into, His face; think of His love, His wonderful, tender, pitying
   love.  Just tell Him how sinful and cold and dark all is:  it is the
   Father's loving heart will give light and warmth to yours.  O do what
   Jesus says:  Just shut the door, and pray to thy Father which is in
   secret.  Is it not wonderful?  to be able to go alone with God, the
   infinite God.  And then to look up and say:  My Father!

   And thy Father, which seeth in secret, will recompense thee.'  Here
   Jesus assures us that secret prayer cannot be fruitless:  its blessing
   will show itself in our life.  We have but in secret, alone with God,
   to entrust our life before men to Him; He will reward us openly; He
   will see to it that the answer to prayer be made manifest in His
   blessing upon us.  Our Lord would thus teach us that as infinite
   Fatherliness and Faithfulness is that with which God meets us in
   secret, so on our part there should be the childlike simplicity of
   faith, the confidence that our prayer does bring down a blessing.  He
   that cometh to God must believe that He is a rewarder of them that seek
   Him.'  Not on the strong or the fervent feeling with which I pray does
   the blessing of the closet depend, but upon the love and the power of
   the Father to whom I there entrust my needs.  And therefore the Master
   has but one desire:  Remember your Father is, and sees and hears in
   secret; go there and stay there, and go again from there in the
   confidence:  He will recompense.  Trust Him for it; depend upon Him:
   prayer to the Father cannot be vain; He will reward you openly.

   Still further to confirm this faith in the Father-love of God, Christ
   speaks a third word:  Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of
   before ye ask Him.'  At first sight it might appear as if this thought
   made prayer less needful:  God knows far better than we what we need.
   But as we get a deeper insight into what prayer really is, this truth
   will help much to strengthen our faith.  It will teach us that we do
   not need, as the heathen, with the multitude and urgency of our words,
   to compel an unwilling God to listen to us.  It will lead to a holy
   thoughtfulness and silence in prayer as it suggests the question:  Does
   my Father really know that I need this?  It will, when once we have
   been led by the Spirit to the certainty that our request is indeed
   something that, according to the Word, we do need for God's glory, give
   us wonderful confidence to say, My Father knows I need it and must have
   it.  And if there be any delay in the answer, it will teach us in quiet
   perseverance to hold on:  FATHER!  THOU KNOWEST I need it.  O the
   blessed liberty and simplicity of a child that Christ our Teacher would
   fain cultivate in us, as we draw near to God:  let us look up to the
   Father until His Spirit works it in us.  Let us sometimes in our
   prayers, when we are in danger of being so occupied with our fervent,
   urgent petitions, as to forget that the Father knows and hears, let us
   hold still and just quietly say:  My Father sees, my Father hears, my
   Father knows; it will help our faith to take the answer, and to say:
   We know that we have the petitions we have asked of Him.

   And now, all ye who have anew entered the school of Christ to be taught
   to pray, take these lessons, practise them, and trust Him to perfect
   you in them.  Dwell much in the inner chamber, with the door shut--shut
   in from men, shut up with God; it is there the Father waits you, it is
   there Jesus will teach you to pray.  To be alone in secret with THE
   FATHER:  this be your highest joy.  To be assured that THE FATHER will
   openly reward the secret prayer, so that it cannot remain unblessed:
   this be your strength day by day.  And to know that THE FATHER knows
   that you need what you ask;  this be your liberty to bring every need,
   in the assurance that your God will supply it according to His riches
   in Glory in Christ Jesus.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Saviour!  with my whole heart I do bless Thee for the
   appointment of the inner chamber, as the school where Thou meetest each
   of Thy pupils alone, and revealest to him the Father.  O my Lord!
   strengthen my faith so in the Father's tender love and kindness, that
   as often as I feel sinful or troubled, the first instinctive thought
   may be to go where I know the Father waits me, and where prayer never
   can go unblessed.  Let the thought that He knows my need before I ask,
   bring me, in great restfulness of faith, to trust that He will give
   what His child requires.  O let the place of secret prayer become to me
   the most beloved spot of earth.

   And, Lord!  hear me as I pray that Thou wouldest everywhere bless the
   closets of Thy believing people.  Let Thy wonderful revelation of a
   Father's tenderness free all young Christians from every thought of
   secret prayer as a duty or a burden, and lead them to regard it as the
   highest privilege of their life, a joy and a blessing.  Bring back all
   who are discouraged, because they cannot find ought to bring Thee in
   prayer.  O give them to understand that they have only to come with
   their emptiness to Him who has all to give, and delights to do it.
   Not, what they have to bring the Father, but what the Father waits to
   give them, be their one thought.

   And bless especially the inner chamber of all Thy servants who are
   working for Thee, as the place where God's truth and God's grace is
   revealed to them, where they are daily anointed with fresh oil, where
   their strength is renewed, and the blessings are received in faith,
   with which they are to bless their fellow-men.  Lord, draw us all in
   the closet nearer to Thyself and the Father.  Amen.

FOURTH LESSON

  After this manner pray;'

  Or,    The Model Prayer.

   After this manner therefore pray ye:  Our Father which art in
   heaven.'--Matt. vi. 9.

   EVERY teacher knows the power of example.  He not only tells the child
   what to do and how to do it, but shows him how it really can be done.
   In condescension to our weakness, our heavenly Teacher has given us the
   very words we are to take with us as we draw near to our Father.  We
   have in them a form of prayer in which there breathe the freshness and
   fulness of the Eternal Life.  So simple that the child can lisp it, so
   divinely rich that it comprehends all that God can give.  A form of
   prayer that becomes the model and inspiration for all other prayer, and
   yet always draws us back to itself as the deepest utterance of our
   souls before our God.

   Our Father which art in heaven!'  To appreciate this word of adoration
   aright, I must remember that none of the saints had in Scripture ever
   ventured to address God as their Father.  The invocation places us at
   once in the centre of the wonderful revelation the Son came to make of
   His Father as our Father too.  It comprehends the mystery of
   redemption--Christ delivering us from the curse that we might become
   the children of God.  The mystery of regeneration--the Spirit in the
   new birth giving us the new life.  And the mystery of faith--ere yet
   the redemption is accomplished or understood, the word is given on the
   lips of the disciples to prepare them for the blessed experience still
   to come.  The words are the key to the whole prayer, to all prayer.  It
   takes time, it takes life to study them; it will take eternity to
   understand them fully.  The knowledge of God's Father-love is the first
   and simplest, but also the last and highest lesson in the school of
   prayer.  It is in the personal relation to the living God, and the
   personal conscious fellowship of love with Himself, that prayer
   begins.  It is in the knowledge of God's Fatherliness, revealed by the
   Holy Spirit, that the power of prayer will be found to root and grow.
   In the infinite tenderness and pity and patience of the infinite
   Father, in His loving readiness to hear and to help, the life of prayer
   has its joy.  O let us take time, until the Spirit has made these words
   to us spirit and truth, filling heart and life:  Our Father which art
   in heaven.'  Then we are indeed within the veil, in the secret place of
   power where prayer always prevails.

    Hallowed be Thy name.'  There is something here that strikes us at
   once.  While we ordinarily first bring our own needs to God in prayer,
   and then think of what belongs to God and His interests, the Master
   reverses the order.  First, Thy name, Thy kingdom, Thy will; then, give
   us, forgive us, lead us, deliver us.  The lesson is of more importance
   than we think.  In true worship the Father must be first, must be all.
   The sooner I learn to forget myself in the desire that HE may be
   glorified, the richer will the blessing be that prayer will bring to
   myself.  No one ever loses by what he sacrifices for the Father.

   This must influence all our prayer.  There are two sorts of prayer:
   personal and intercessory.  The latter ordinarily occupies the lesser
   part of our time and energy.  This may not be.  Christ has opened the
   school of prayer specially to train intercessors for the great work of
   bringing down, by their faith and prayer, the blessings of His work and
   love on the world around.  There can be no deep growth in prayer unless
   this be made our aim.  The little child may ask of the father only what
   it needs for itself; and yet it soon learns to say, Give some for
   sister too.  But the grown-up son, who only lives for the father's
   interest and takes charge of the father's business, asks more largely,
   and gets all that is asked.  And Jesus would train us to the blessed
   life of consecration and service, in which our interests are all
   subordinate to the Name, and the Kingdom, and the Will of the Father.
   O let us live for this, and let, on each act of adoration, Our Father!
   there follow in the same breath Thy Name, Thy Kingdom, Thy Will;--for
   this we look up and long.

   Hallowed be Thy name.'  What name?  This new name of Father.  The word
   Holy is the central word of the Old Testament; the name Father of the
   New.  In this name of Love all the holiness and glory of God are now to
   be revealed.  And how is the name to be hallowed?  By God Himself:  I
   will hallow My great name which ye have profaned.'  Our prayer must be
   that in ourselves, in all God's children, in presence of the world, God
   Himself would reveal the holiness, the Divine power, the hidden glory
   of the name of Father.  The Spirit of the Father is the Holy Spirit:
   it is only when we yield ourselves to be led of Him, that the name will
   be hallowed in our prayers and our lives.  Let us learn the prayer:
   Our Father, hallowed be Thy name.'

   Thy kingdom come.'  The Father is a King and has a kingdom.  The son
   and heir of a king has no higher ambition than the glory of his
   father's kingdom.  In time of war or danger this becomes his passion;
   he can think of nothing else.  The children of the Father are here in
   the enemy's territory, where the kingdom, which is in heaven, is not
   yet fully manifested.  What more natural than that, when they learn to
   hallow the Father-name, they should long and cry with deep enthusiasm:
   Thy kingdom come.'  The coming of the kingdom is the one great event on
   which the revelation of the Father's glory, the blessedness of His
   children, the salvation of the world depends.  On our prayers too the
   coming of the kingdom waits.  Shall we not join in the deep longing cry
   of the redeemed:  Thy kingdom come'?  Let us learn it in the school of
   Jesus.

   Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.'  This petition is too
   frequently applied alone to the suffering  of the will of God.  In
   heaven God's will is done, and the Master teaches the child to ask that
   the will may be done on earth just as in heaven:  in the spirit of
   adoring submission and ready obedience.  Because the will of God is the
   glory of heaven, the doing of it is the blessedness of heaven.  As the
   will is done, the kingdom of heaven comes into the heart.  And wherever
   faith has accepted the Father's love, obedience accepts the Father's
   will.  The surrender to, and the prayer for a life of heaven-like
   obedience, is the spirit of childlike prayer.

   Give us this day our daily bread.'  When first the child has yielded
   himself to the Father in the care for His Name, His Kingdom, and His
   Will, he has full liberty to ask for his daily bread.  A master cares
   for the food of his servant, a general of his soldiers, a father of his
   child.  And will not the Father in heaven care for the child who has in
   prayer given himself up to His interests?  We may indeed in full
   confidence say:  Father, I live for Thy honour and Thy work; I know
   Thou carest for me.  Consecration to God and His will gives wonderful
   liberty in prayer for temporal things:  the whole earthly life is given
   to the Father's loving care.

   And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.'  As
   bread is the first need of the body, so forgiveness for the soul.  And
   the provision for the one is as sure as for the other.  We are children
   but sinners too; our right of access to the Father's presence we owe to
   the precious blood and the forgiveness it has won for us.  Let us
   beware of the prayer for forgiveness becoming a formality:  only what
   is really confessed is really forgiven.  Let us in faith accept the
   forgiveness as promised:  as a spiritual reality, an actual transaction
   between God and us, it is the entrance into all the Father's love and
   all the privileges of children.  Such forgiveness, as a living
   experience, is impossible without a forgiving spirit to others:  as
   forgiven expresses the heavenward, so forgiving the earthward, relation
   of God's child.  In each prayer to the Father I must be able to say
   that I know of no one whom I do not heartily love.

   And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'
   Our daily bread, the pardon of our sins, and then our being kept from
   all sin and the power of the evil one, in these three petitions all our
   personal need is comprehended.  The prayer for bread and pardon must be
   accompanied by the surrender to live in all things in holy obedience to
   the Father's will, and the believing prayer in everything to be kept by
   the power of the indwelling Spirit from the power of the evil one.

   Children of God! it is thus Jesus would have us to pray to the Father
   in heaven.  O let His Name, and Kingdom, and Will, have the first place
   in our love; His providing, and pardoning, and keeping love will be our
   sure portion.  So the prayer will lead us up to the true child-life:
   the Father all to the child, the Father all for the child.  We shall
   understand how Father and child, the Thine and the Our, are all one,
   and how the heart that begins its prayer with the God-devoted THINE,
   will have the power in faith to speak out the OUR too.  Such prayer
   will, indeed, be the fellowship and interchange of love, always
   bringing us back in trust and worship to Him who is not only the
   Beginning but the End:  FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND
   THE GLORY, FOR EVER, AMEN.'  Son of the Father, teach us to pray, OUR
   FATHER.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O Thou who art the only-begotten Son, teach us, we beseech Thee, to
   pray, OUR FATHER.'  We thank Thee, Lord, for these Living Blessed Words
   which Thou has given us.  We thank Thee for the millions who in them
   have learnt to know and worship the Father, and for what they have been
   to us.  Lord! it is as if we needed days and weeks in Thy school with
   each separate petition; so deep and full are they.  But we look to Thee
   to lead us deeper into their meaning:  do it, we pray Thee, for Thy
   Name's sake; Thy name is Son of the Father.

   Lord!  Thou didst once say:  No man knoweth the Father save the Son,
   and he to whom the Son willeth to reveal Him.'  And again:  I made
   known unto them Thy name, and will make it known, that the love
   wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them.'  Lord Jesus! reveal to us
   the Father.  Let His name, His infinite Father-love, the love with
   which He loved Thee, according to Thy prayer, BE IN US.  Then shall we
   say aright, OUR FATHER!'  Then shall we apprehend Thy teaching, and the
   first spontaneous breathing of our heart will be:  Our Father, Thy
   Name, Thy Kingdom, Thy Will.'  And we shall bring our needs and our
   sins and our temptations to Him in the confidence that the love of such
   a Father care for all.

   Blessed Lord! we are Thy scholars, we trust Thee; do teach us to pray,
   OUR FATHER.'  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

FIFTH LESSON.

  'Ask, and it shall be given you'

  Or,    The Certainty of the Answer to Prayer.

   Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you:  for every one that asketh receiveth, and he
   that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be
   opened,'--Matt. vii. 7, 8.

   Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss.'--Jas. iv. 3.

   OUR Lord returns here in the Sermon on the Mount a second time to speak
   of prayer.  The first time He had spoken of the Father who is to be
   found in secret, and rewards openly, and had given us the pattern
   prayer (Matt. vi. 5-15).  Here He wants to teach us what in all
   Scripture is considered the chief thing in prayer:  the assurance that
   prayer will be heard and answered.  Observe how He uses words which
   mean almost the same thing, and each time repeats the promise so
   distinctly:  Ye shall receive, ye shall find, it shall be opened unto
   you;' and then gives as ground for such assurance the law of the
   kingdom:  He that asketh, receiveth; he that seeketh, findeth; to him
   that knocketh, it shall be opened.'  We cannot but feel how in this
   sixfold repetition He wants to impress deep on our minds this one
   truth, that we may and must most confidently expect an answer to our
   prayer.  Next to the revelation of the Father's love, there is, in the
   whole course of the school of prayer, not a more important lesson than
   this:  Every one that asketh, receiveth.

   In the three words the Lord uses, ask, seek, knock, a difference in
   meaning has been sought.  If such was indeed His purpose, then the
   first, ASK, refers to the gifts we pray for.  But I may ask and receive
   the gift without the Giver.  SEEK is the word Scripture uses of God
   Himself; Christ assures me that I can find Himself.  But it is not
   enough to find God in time of need, without coming to abiding
   fellowship:  KNOCK speaks of admission to dwell with Him and in Him.
   Asking and receiving the gift would thus lead to seeking and finding
   the Giver, and this again to the knocking and opening of the door of
   the Father's home and love.  One thing is sure:  the Lord does want us
   to count most certainly on it that asking, seeking, knocking, cannot be
   in vain:  receiving an answer, finding God, the opened heart and home
   of God, are the certain fruit of prayer.

   That the Lord should have thought it needful in so many forms to repeat
   the truth, is a lesson of deep import.  It proves that He knows our
   heart, how doubt and distrust toward God are natural to us, and how
   easily we are inclined to rest in prayer as a religious work without an
   answer.  He knows too how, even when we believe that God is the Hearer
   of prayer, believing prayer that lays hold of the promise, is something
   spiritual, too high and difficult for the half-hearted disciple.  He
   therefore at the very outset of His instruction to those who would
   learn to pray, seeks to lodge this truth deep into their hearts:
   prayer does avail much; ask and ye shall receive; every one that
   asketh, receiveth.  This is the fixed eternal law of the kingdom:  if
   you ask and receive not, it must be because there is something amiss or
   wanting in the prayer.  Hold on; let the Word and the Spirit teach you
   to pray aright, but do not let go the confidence He seeks to waken:
   Every one that asketh, receiveth.

   Ask, and it shall be given you.'  Christ has no mightier stimulus to
   persevering prayer in His school than this.  As a child has to prove a
   sum to be correct, so the proof that we have prayed aright is, the
   answer.  If we ask and receive not, it is because we have not learned
   to pray aright.  Let every learner in the school of Christ therefore
   take the Master's word in all simplicity:  Every one that asketh,
   receiveth.  He had good reasons for speaking so unconditionally.  Let
   us beware of weakening the Word with our human wisdom.  When He tells
   us heavenly things, let us believe Him:  His Word will explain itself
   to him who believes it fully.  If questions and difficulties arise, let
   us not seek to have them settled before we accept the Word.  No; let us
   entrust them all to Him:  it is His to solve them:  our work is first
   and fully to accept and hold fast His promise.  Let in our inner
   chamber, in the inner chamber of our heart too, the Word be inscribed
   in letters of light:  Every one that asketh, receiveth.

   According to this teaching of the Master, prayer consists of two parts,
   has two sides, a human and a Divine.  The human is the asking, the
   Divine is the giving.  Or, to look at both from the human side, there
   is the asking and the receiving--the two halves that make up a whole.
   It is as if He would tell us that we are not to rest without an answer,
   because it is the will of God, the rule in the Father's family:  every
   childlike believing petition is granted.  If no answer comes, we are
   not to sit down in the sloth that calls itself resignation, and suppose
   that it is not God's will to give an answer.  No; there must be
   something in the prayer that is not as God would have it, childlike and
   believing; we must seek for grace to pray so that the answer may come.
   It is far easier to the flesh to submit without the answer than to
   yield itself to be searched and purified by the Spirit, until it has
   learnt to pray the prayer of faith.

   It is one of the terrible marks of the diseased state of Christian life
   in these days, that there are so many who rest content without the
   distinct experience of answer to prayer.  They pray daily, they ask
   many things, and trust that some of them will be heard, but know little
   of direct definite answer to prayer as the rule of daily life.  And it
   is this the Father wills:  He seeks daily intercourse with His children
   in listening to and granting their petitions.  he wills that I should
   come to Him day by day with distinct requests; He wills day by day to
   do for me what I ask.  It was in His answer to prayer that the saints
   of old learned to know God as the Living One, and were stirred to
   praise and love (Ps. xxxiv., lxvi. 19, cxvi. 1).  Our Teacher waits to
   imprint this upon our minds:  prayer and its answer, the child asking
   and the father giving, belong to each other.

   There may be cases in which the answer is a refusal, because the
   request is not according to God's Word, as when Moses asked to enter
   Canaan.  But still, there was an answer:  God did not leave His servant
   in uncertainty as to His will.  The gods of the heathen are dumb and
   cannot speak.  Our Father lets His child know when He cannot give him
   what he asks, and he withdraws his petition, even as the Son did in
   Gethsemane.  Both Moses the servant and Christ the Son knew that what
   they asked was not according to what the Lord had spoken:  their prayer
   was the humble supplication whether it was not possible for the
   decision to be changed.  God will teach those who are teachable and
   give Him time, by His Word and Spirit, whether their request be
   according to His will or not.  Let us withdraw the request, if it be
   not according to God's mind, or persevere till the answer come.  Prayer
   is appointed to obtain the answer.  It is in prayer and its answer that
   the interchange of love between the Father and His child takes place.

   How deep the estrangement of our heart from God must be, that we find
   it so difficult to grasp such promises.  Even while we accept the words
   and believe their truth, the faith of the heart, that fully has them
   and rejoices in them, comes so slowly.  It is because our spiritual
   life is still so weak, and the capacity for taking God's thoughts is so
   feeble.  But let us look to Jesus to teach us as none but He can
   teach.  If we take His words in simplicity, and trust Him by His Spirit
   to make them within us life and power, they will so enter into our
   inner being, that the spiritual Divine reality of the truth they
   contain will indeed take possession of us, and we shall not rest
   content until every petition we offer is borne heavenward on Jesus' own
   words:  Ask, and it shall be given you.'

   Beloved fellow-disciples in the school of Jesus!  let us set ourselves
   to learn this lesson well.  Let us take these words just as they were
   spoken.  Let us not suffer human reason to weaken their force.  Let us
   take them as Jesus gives them, and believe them.  He will teach us in
   due time how to understand them fully:  let us begin by implicitly
   believing them.  Let us take time, as often as we pray, to listen to
   His voice:  Every one that asketh, receiveth.  Let us not make the
   feeble experiences of our unbelief the measure of what our faith may
   expect.  Let us seek, not only just in our seasons of prayer, but at
   all times, to hold fast the joyful assurance:  man's prayer on earth
   and God's answer in heaven are meant for each other.  Let us trust
   Jesus to teach us so to pray that the answer can come.  He will do it,
   if we hold fast the word He gives today:  Ask, and ye shall receive.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O Lord Jesus!  teach me to understand and believe what Thou hast now
   promised me.  It is not hid from Thee, O my Lord, with what reasonings
   my heart seeks to satisfy itself, when no answer comes.  There is the
   thought that my prayer is not in harmony with the Father's secret
   counsel; that there is perhaps something better Thou wouldest give me;
   or that prayer as fellowship with God is blessing enough without an
   answer.  And yet, my blessed Lord, I find in Thy teaching on prayer
   that Thou didst not speak of these things, but didst say so plainly,
   that prayer may and must expect an answer.  Thou dost assure us that
   this is the fellowship of a child with the Father:  the child asks and
   the Father gives.

   Blessed Lord!  Thy words are faithful and true.  It must be, because I
   pray amiss, that my experience of answered prayer is not clearer.  It
   must be, because I live too little in the Spirit, that my prayer is too
   little in the Spirit, and that the power for the prayer of faith is
   wanting.

   Lord!  teach me to pray.  Lord Jesus!  I trust Thee for it; teach me to
   pray in faith.  Lord!  teach me this lesson of today:  Every one that
   asketh receiveth.  Amen.

SIXTH LESSON.

  How much more?'

  Or,    The Infinite Fatherliness of God.

   Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask him for a loaf, will
   give him a stone; or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a
   serpent?  If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
   children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good
   things to them that ask Him?'--Matt. vii. 9-11

   IN these words our Lord proceeds further to confirm what He had said of
   the certainty of an answer to prayer.  To remove all doubt, and show us
   on what sure ground His promise rests, He appeals to what every one has
   seen and experienced here on earth.  We are all children, and know what
   we expected of our fathers.  We are fathers, or continually see them;
   and everywhere we look upon it as the most natural thing there can be,
   for a father to hear his child.  And the Lord asks us to look up from
   earthly parents, of whom the best are but evil, and to calculate HOW
   MUCH MORE the heavenly Father will give good gifts to them that ask
   Him.  Jesus would lead us up to see, that as much greater as God is
   than sinful man, so much greater our assurance ought to be that He will
   more surely than any earthly father grant our childlike petitions.  As
   much greater as God is than man, so much surer is it that prayer will
   be heard with the Father in heaven than with a father on earth.

   As simple and intelligible as this parable is, so deep and spiritual is
   the teaching it contains.  The Lord would remind us that the prayer of
   a child owes its influence entirely to the relation in which he stands
   to the parent.  The prayer can exert that influence only when the child
   is really living in that relationship, in the home, in the love, in the
   service of the Father.  The power of the promise, Ask, and it shall be
   given you,' lies in the loving relationship between us as children and
   the Father in heaven; when we live and walk in that relationship, the
   prayer of faith and its answer will be the natural result.  And so the
   lesson we have today in the school of prayer is this:  Live as a child
   of God, then you will be able to pray as a child, and as a child you
   will most assuredly be heard.

   And what is the true child-life?  The answer can be found in any home.
   The child that by preference forsakes the father's house, that finds no
   pleasure in the presence and love and obedience of the father, and
   still thinks to ask and obtain what he will, will surely be
   disappointed.  On the contrary, he to whom the intercourse and will and
   honour and love of the father are the joy of his life, will find that
   it is the father's joy to grant his requests.  Scripture says, As many
   as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the children of God:'  the
   childlike privilege of asking all is inseparable from the childlike
   life under the leading of the Spirit.  He that gives himself to be led
   by the Spirit in his life, will be led by Him in his prayers too.  And
   he will find that Fatherlike giving is the Divine response to childlike
   living.

   To see what this childlike living is, in which childlike asking and
   believing have their ground, we have only to notice what our Lord
   teaches in the Sermon on the Mount of the Father and His children.  In
   it the prayer-promises are imbedded in the life-precepts; the two are
   inseparable.  They form one whole; and He alone can count on the
   fulfilment of the promise, who accepts too all that the Lord has
   connected with it.  It is as if in speaking the word, Ask, and ye shall
   receive,' He says:  I give these promises to those whom in the
   beatitudes I have pictured in their childlike poverty and purity, and
   of whom I have said, They shall be called the children of God' (Matt.
   v. 3-9):  to children, who let your light shine before men, so that
   they may glorify your Father in heaven:'  to those who walk in love,
   that ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven,' and who
   seek to be perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect' (v. 45):
   to those whose fasting and praying and almsgiving (vi. 1-18) is not
   before men, but before your Father which seeth in secret;' who forgive
   even as your Father forgiveth you' (vi. 15); who trust the heavenly
   Father in all earthly need, seeking first the kingdom of God and His
   righteousness (vi. 26-32); who not only say, Lord, Lord, but do the
   will of my Father which is in heaven (vii. 21).  Such are the children
   of the Father, and such is the life in the Father's love and service;
   in such a child-life answered prayers are certain and abundant.

   But will not such teaching discourage the feeble one?  If we are first
   to answer to this portrait of a child, must not many give up all hope
   of answers to prayer?  The difficulty is removed if we think again of
   the blessed name of father and child.  A child is weak; there is a
   great difference among children in age and gift.  The Lord does not
   demand of us a perfect fulfilment of the law; no, but only the
   childlike and whole-hearted surrender to live as a child with Him in
   obedience and truth.  Nothing more.  But also, nothing less.  The
   Father must have the whole heart.  When this is given, and He sees the
   child with honest purpose and steady will seeking in everything to be
   and live as a child, then our prayer will count with Him as the prayer
   of a child.  Let any one simply and honestly begin to study the Sermon
   on the Mount and take it as his guide in life, and he will find,
   notwithstanding weakness and failure, an ever-growing liberty to claim
   the fulfilment of its promises in regard to prayer.  In the names of
   father and child he has the pledge that his petitions will be granted.

   This is the one chief thought on which Jesus dwells here, and which He
   would have all His scholars take in.  He would have us see that the
   secret of effectual prayer is:  to have the heart filled with the
   Father-love of God.  It is not enough for us to know that God is a
   Father:  He would have us take time to come under the full impression
   of what that name implies.  We must take the best earthly father we
   know; we must think of the tenderness and love with which he regards
   the request of his child, the love and joy with which he grants every
   reasonable desire; we must then, as we think in adoring worship of the
   infinite Love and Fatherliness of God, consider with how much more
   tenderness and joy He sees us come to Him, and gives us what we ask
   aright.  And then, when we see how much this Divine arithmetic is
   beyond our comprehension, and feel how impossible it is for us to
   apprehend God's readiness to hear us, then He would have us come and
   open our heart for the Holy Spirit to shed abroad God's Father-love
   there.  Let us do this not only when we want to pray, but let us yield
   heart and life to dwell in that love.  The child who only wants to know
   the love of the father when he has something to ask, will be
   disappointed.  But he who lets God be Father always and in everything,
   who would fain live his whole life in the Father's presence and love,
   who allows God in all the greatness of His love to be a Father to him,
   oh! he will experience most gloriously that a life in God's infinite
   Fatherliness and continual answers to prayer are inseparable.

   Beloved fellow-disciple!  we begin to see what the reason is that we
   know so little of daily answers to prayer, and what the chief lesson is
   which the Lord has for us in His school.  It is all in the name of
   Father.  We thought of new and deeper insight into some of the
   mysteries of the prayer-world as what we should get in Christ's
   school;  He tells us the first is the highest lesson; we must learn to
   say well, Abba, Father!'  Our Father which art in heaven.'  He that can
   say this, has the key to all prayer.  In all the compassion with which
   a father listens to his weak or sickly child, in all the joy with which
   he hears his stammering child, in all the gentle patience with which he
   bears with a thoughtless child, we must, as in so many mirrors, study
   the heart of our Father, until every prayer be borne upward on the
   faith of this Divine word:  How much more shall your heavenly Father
   give good gifts to them that ask Him.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord!  Thou knowest that this, though it be one of the first
   and simplest and most glorious lessons in Thy school, is to our hearts
   one of the hardest to learn:  we know so little of the love of the
   Father.  Lord!  teach us so to live with the Father that His love may
   be to us nearer, clearer, dearer, than the love of any earthly father.
   And let the assurance of His hearing our prayer be as much greater than
   the confidence in an earthly parent, as the heavens are higher than
   earth, as God is infinitely greater than man.  Lord!  show us that it
   is only our unchildlike distance from the Father that hinders the
   answer to prayer, and lead us on to the true life of God's children.
   Lord Jesus!  it is fatherlike love that wakens childlike trust.  O
   reveal to us the Father, and His tender, pitying love, that we may
   become childlike, and experience how in the child-life lies the power
   of prayer.

   Blessed Son of God!  the Father loveth Thee and hath given Thee all
   things.  And Thou lovest the Father, and hast done all things He
   commanded Thee, and therefore hast the power to ask all things.  Lord!
   give us Thine own Spirit, the Spirit of the Son.  Make us childlike, as
   Thou wert on earth.  And let every prayer be breathed in the faith that
   as the heaven is higher than the earth, so God's Father-love, and His
   readiness to give us what we ask, surpasses all we can think or
   conceive.  Amen.

   NOTE.^1

   Your Father which is in heaven.'  Alas!  we speak of it only as the
   utterance of a reverential homage.  We think of it as a figure borrowed
   from an earthly life, and only in some faint and shallow meaning to be
   used of God.  We are afraid to take God as our own tender and pitiful
   father.  He is a schoolmaster, or almost farther off than that, and
   knowing less about us--an inspector, who knows nothing of us except
   through our lessons.  His eyes are not on the scholar, but on the book,
   and all alike must come up to the standard.

   Now open the ears of the heart, timid child of God; let it go sinking
   right down into the inner most depths of the soul.  Here is the
   starting-point of holiness, in the love and patience and pity of our
   heavenly Father.  We have not to learn to be holy as a hard lesson at
   school, that we may make God think well of us; we are to learn it at
   home with the Father to help us.  God loves you not because you are
   clever not because you are good, but because He is your Father.  The
   Cross of Christ does not make God love us; it is the outcome and
   measure of His love to us.  He loves all His children, the clumsiest,
   the dullest, the worst of His children.  His love lies at the back of
   everything, and we must get upon that as the solid foundation of our
   religious life, not growing up into that, but growing up out of it.  We
   must begin there or our beginning will come to nothing.  Do take hold
   of this mightily.  We must go out of ourselves for any hope, or any
   strength, or any confidence.  And what hope, what strength, what
   confidence may be ours now that we begin here, your Father which is in
   heaven!

   We need to get in at the tenderness and helpfulness which lie in these
   words, and to rest upon it--your Father.  Speak them over to yourself
   until something of the wonderful truth is felt by us.  It means that I
   am bound to God by the closest and tenderest relationship;  that I have
   a right to His love and His power and His blessing, such as nothing
   else could give me.  O the boldness with which we can draw near!  O the
   great things we have a right to ask for!  Your Father.  It means that
   all His infinite love and patience and wisdom bend over me to help me.
   In this relationship lies not only the possibility of holiness; there
   is infinitely more than that.

   Here we are to begin, in the patient love of our Father.  Think how He
   knows us apart and by ourselves, in all our peculiarities, and in all
   our weaknesses and difficulties.  The master judges by the result, but
   our Father judges by the effort.  Failure does not always mean fault.
   He knows how much things cost, and weighs them where others only
   measure.  YOUR FATHER.  Think how great store His love sets by the poor
   beginnings of the little ones, clumsy and unmeaning as they may be to
   others.  All this lies in this blessed relationship and infinitely
   more.  Do not fear to take it all as your own.

   ^1From Thoughts on Holiness, by Mark Guy Pearse.  What is so
   beautifully said of the knowledge of God's Fatherliness as the
   starting-point of holiness is no less true of prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

SEVENTH LESSON.

  How much more the Holy Spirit;

  Or,    The All-Comprehensive Gift.

   If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children,
   how much more shall the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them
   that ask Him?'--Luke xi. 13.

   IN the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord had already given utterance to His
   wonderful HOW MUCH MORE?  Here in Luke, where He repeats the question,
   there is a difference.  Instead of speaking, as then of giving good
   gifts, He says, How much more shall the heavenly Father give THE HOLY
   SPIRIT?'  He thus teaches us that the chief and the best of these gifts
   is the Holy Spirit, or rather, that in this gift all others are
   comprised  The Holy Spirit is the first of the Father's gifts, and the
   one He delights most to bestow.  The Holy Spirit is therefore the gift
   we ought first and chiefly to seek.

   The unspeakable worth of this gift we can easily understand.  Jesus
   spoke of the Spirit as the promise of the Father;' the one promise in
   which God's Fatherhood revealed itself.  The best gift a good and wise
   father can bestow on a child on earth is his own spirit.  This is the
   great object of a father in education--to reproduce in his child his
   own disposition and character.  If the child is to know and understand
   his father; if, as he grows up, he is to enter into all his will and
   plans; if he is to have his highest joy in the father, and the father
   in him,--he must be of one mind and spirit with him.  And so it is
   impossible to conceive of God bestowing any higher gift on His child
   than this, His own Spirit.  God is what He is through His Spirit; the
   Spirit is the very life of God.  Just think what it means--God giving
   His own Spirit to His child on earth.

   Or was not this the glory of Jesus as a Son upon earth, that the Spirit
   of the Father was in Him?  At His baptism in Jordan the two things were
   united,--the voice, proclaiming Him the Beloved Son, and the Spirit,
   descending upon Him.  And so the apostle says of us, Because ye are
   sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying,
   Abba, Father.'  A king seeks in the whole education of his son to call
   forth in him a kingly spirit.  Our Father in heaven desires to educate
   us as His children for the holy, heavenly life in which He dwells, and
   for this gives us, from the depths of His heart, His own Spirit.  It
   was this which was the whole aim of Jesus when, after having made
   atonement with His own blood, He entered for us into God's presence,
   that He might obtain for us, and send down to dwell in us, the Holy
   Spirit.  As the Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, the whole life
   and love of the Father and the Son are in Him; and, coming down into
   us, He lifts us up into their fellowship.  As Spirit of the Father, He
   sheds abroad the Father's love, with which He loved the Son, in our
   hearts, and teaches us to live in it.  As Spirit of the Son, He
   breathes in us the childlike liberty, and devotion, and obedience in
   which the Son lived upon earth.  The Father can bestow no higher or
   more wonderful gift than this:  His own Holy Spirit, the Spirit of
   sonship.

   This truth naturally suggests the thought that this first and chief
   gift of God must be the first and chief object of all prayer.  For
   every need of the spiritual life this is the one thing needful, the
   Holy Spirit.  All the fulness is in Jesus; the fulness of grace and
   truth, out of which we receive grace for grace.  The Holy Spirit is the
   appointed conveyancer, whose special work it is to make Jesus and all
   there is in Him for us ours in personal appropriation, in blessed
   experience.  He is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus; as wonderful as
   the life is, so wonderful is the provision by which such an agent is
   provided to communicate it to us.  If we but yield ourselves entirely
   to the disposal of the Spirit, and let Him have His way with us, He
   will manifest the life of Christ within us.  He will do this with a
   Divine power, maintaining the life of Christ in us in uninterrupted
   continuity.  Surely, if there is one prayer that should draw us to the
   Father's throne and keep us there, it is this:  for the Holy Spirit,
   whom we as children have received, to stream into us and out from us in
   greater fulness.

   In the variety of the gifts which the Spirit has to dispense, He meets
   the believer's every need.  Just think of the names He bears.  The
   Spirit of grace, to reveal and impart all of grace there is in Jesus.
   The Spirit of faith, teaching us to begin and go on and increase in
   ever believing.  The Spirit of adoption and assurance, who witnesses
   that we are God's children, and inspires the confiding and confident
   Abba, Father!  The Spirit of truth, to lead into all truth, to make
   each word of God ours in deed and in truth.  The Spirit of prayer,
   through whom we speak with the Father; prayer that must be heard.  The
   Spirit of judgment and burning, to search the heart, and convince of
   sin.  The Spirit of holiness, manifesting and communicating the
   Father's holy presence within us.  The Spirit of power, through whom we
   are strong to testify boldly and work effectually in the Father's
   service.  The Spirit of glory, the pledge of our inheritance, the
   preparation and the foretaste of the glory to come.  Surely the child
   of God needs but one thing to be able really to live as a child:  it
   is, to be filled with this Spirit.

   And now, the lesson Jesus teaches us today in His school is this:  That
   the Father is just longing to give Him to us if we will but ask in the
   childlike dependence on what He says:  If ye know to give good gifts
   unto your children, HOW MUCH MORE shall your heavenly Father give the
   Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.'  In the words of God's promise, I
   will pour out my Spirit abundantly;' and of His command, Be ye filled
   with the Spirit' we have the measure of what God is ready to give, and
   what we may obtain.  As God's children, we have already received the
   Spirit.  But we still need to ask and pray for His special gifts and
   operations as we require them.  And not only this, but for Himself to
   take complete and entire possession; for His unceasing momentary
   guidance.  Just as the branch, already filled with the sap of the vine,
   is ever crying for the continued and increasing flow of that sap, that
   it may bring its fruit to perfection, so the believer, rejoicing in the
   possession of the Spirit, ever thirsts and cries for more.  And what
   the great Teacher would have us learn is, that nothing less than God's
   promise and God's command may be the measure of our expectation and our
   prayer; we must be filled abundantly.  He would have us ask this in the
   assurance that the wonderful HOW MUCH MORE of God's Father-love is the
   pledge that, when we ask, we do most certainly receive.

   Let us now believe this.  As we pray to be filled with the Spirit, let
   us not seek for the answer in our feelings.  All spiritual blessings
   must be received, that is, accepted or taken in faith.^1  Let me
   believe, the Father gives the Holy Spirit to His praying child.  Even
   now, while I pray, I must say in faith:  I have what I ask, the fulness
   of the Spirit is mine.  Let us continue stedfast in this faith.  On the
   strength of God's Word we know that we have what we ask.  Let us, with
   thanksgiving that we have been heard, with thanksgiving for what we
   have received and taken and now hold as ours, continue stedfast in
   believing prayer that the blessing, which has already been given us,
   and which we hold in faith, may break through and fill our whole
   being.  It is in such believing thanksgiving and prayer, that our soul
   opens up for the Spirit to take entire and undisturbed possession.  It
   is such prayer that not only asks and hopes, but takes and holds, that
   inherits the full blessing.  In all our prayer let us remember the
   lesson the Saviour would teach us this day, that, if there is one thing
   on earth we can be sure of, it is this, that the Father desires to have
   us filled with His Spirit, that He delights to give us His Spirit.

   And when once we have learned thus to believe for ourselves, and each
   day to take out of the treasure we hold in heaven, what liberty and
   power to pray for the outpouring of the Spirit on the Church of God, on
   all flesh, on individuals, or on special efforts!  He that has once
   learned to know the Father in prayer for himself, learns to pray most
   confidently for others too.  The Father gives the Holy Spirit to them
   that ask Him, not least, but most, when they ask for others.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Father in heaven!  Thou didst send Thy Son to reveal  Thyself to us,
   Thy Father-love, and all that that love has for us.  And He has taught
   us, that the gift above all gifts which Thou wouldst bestow in answer
   to prayer is, the Holy Spirit.

   O my Father!  I come to Thee with this prayer; there is nothing I
   would--may I not say, I do--desire so much as to be filled with the
   Spirit, the Holy Spirit.  The blessings He brings are so unspeakable,
   and just what I need.  He sheds abroad Thy love in the heart, and fills
   it with Thy self.  I long for this.  He breathes the mind and life of
   Christ in me, so that I live as He did, in and for the Father's love.
   I long for this.  He endues with power from on high for all my walk and
   work.  I long for this.  O Father!  I beseech Thee, give me this day
   the fulness of Thy Spirit.

   Father!  I ask this, resting on the words of my Lord:  HOW MUCH MORE
   THE HOLY SPIRIT.'  I do  believe that Thou hearest my prayer; I receive
   now what I ask; Father!  I claim and I take it:  the fulness of Thy
   Spirit is mine.  I receive the gift this day again as a faith gift; in
   faith I reckon my Father works through the Spirit all He has promised.
   The Father delights to breathe His Spirit into His waiting child as He
   tarries in fellowship with Himself.  Amen.

   ^1The Greek word for receiving and taking is the same.  When Jesus
   said, Everyone that asketh receiveth,' He used the same verb as at the
   Supper, Take, eat,' or on the resurrection morning, Receive,' accept,
   take, the Holy Spirit.'  Receiving not only implies God's bestowment,
   but our acceptance.
     __________________________________________________________________

EIGHTH LESSON.

  Because of his importunity;'

  Or,    The Boldness of God's Friends.

   And He said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go
   to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a
   friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set
   before him' and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not:
   the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise
   and give thee.  I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him
   because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise
   and give him as many as he needeth.'--Luke xi. 5-8.

   THE first teaching to His disciples was given by our Lord in the Sermon
   on the Mount.  It was near a year later that the disciples asked Jesus
   to teach them to pray.  In answer He gave them a second time the Lord's
   Prayer, so teaching them  what to pray.  He then speaks of  how they
   ought to pray, and repeats what he formerly said of God's Fatherliness
   and the certainty of an answer.  But in between He adds the beautiful
   parable of the friend at midnight, to teach them the two fold lesson,
   that God does not only want us to pray for ourselves, but for the
   perishing around us, and that in such intercession great boldness of
   entreaty is often needful, and always lawful, yea, pleasing to God.

   The parable is a perfect storehouse of instruction in regard to true
   intercession.  There is, first, the love which seeks to help the needy
   around us:  my friend is come to me.'  Then the need which urges to the
   cry  I have nothing to set before him.'  Then follows the confidence
   that help is to be had:  which of you shall have a friend, and say,
   Friend, lend me three loaves.'  Then comes the unexpected refusal:  I
   cannot rise and give thee.'  Then again the perseverance that takes no
   refusal:  because of his importunity.'  And lastly, the reward of such
   prayer:  he will give him as many as he needeth.'  A wonderful setting
   forth of the way of prayer and faith in which the blessing of God has
   so often been sought and found.

   Let us confine ourselves to the chief thought:  prayer as an appeal to
   the friendship of God; and we shall find that two lessons are specially
   suggested.  The one, that if we are God's friends, and come as such to
   Him, we must prove ourselves the friends of the needy; God's friendship
   to us and ours to others go hand in hand.  The other, that when we come
   thus we may use the utmost liberty in claiming an answer.

   There is a twofold use of prayer:  the one, to obtain strength and
   blessing for our own life; the other, the higher, the true glory of
   prayer, for which Christ has taken us into His fellowship and teaching,
   is intercession, where prayer is the royal power a child of God
   exercises in heaven on behalf of others and even of the kingdom.  We
   see it in Scripture, how it was in intercession for others that Abraham
   and Moses, Samuel and Elijah, with all the holy men of old, proved that
   they had power with God and prevailed.  It is when we give ourselves to
   be a blessing that we can specially count on the blessing of God.  It
   is when we draw near to God as the friend of the poor and the perishing
   that we may count on His friendliness; the righteous man who is the
   friend of the poor is very specially the friend of God.  This gives
   wonderful liberty in prayer.  Lord!  I have a needy friend whom I must
   help.  As a friend I have undertaken to help him.  In Thee I have a
   Friend, whose kindness and riches I know to be infinite:  I am sure
   Thou wilt give me what I ask.  If I, being evil, am ready to do for my
   friend what I can, how much more wilt Thou, O my heavenly Friend, now
   do for Thy friend what he asks?

   The question might suggest itself, whether the Fatherhood of God does
   not give such confidence in prayer, that the thought of His Friendship
   can hardly teach us anything more:  a father is more than a friend.
   And yet, if we consider it, this pleading the friendship of God opens
   new wonders to us.  That a child obtains what he asks of his father
   looks so perfectly natural, we almost count it the father's duty to
   give.  But with a friend it is as if the kindness is more free,
   dependent, not on nature, but on sympathy and character.  And then the
   relation of a child is more that of perfect dependence; two friends are
   more nearly on a level.  And so our Lord, in seeking to unfold to us
   the spiritual mystery of prayer, would fain have us approach God in
   this relation too, as those whom He has acknowledged as His friends,
   whose mind and life are in sympathy with His.

   But then we must be living as His friends.  I am still a child even
   when a wanderer; but friendship depends upon the conduct.  Ye are my
   friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.'  Thou seest that faith
   wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect; and the
   scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and he
   was called the friend of God.'  It is the Spirit, the same Spirit,'
   that leads us that also bears witness to our acceptance with God;
   likewise, also,' the same Spirit helpeth us in prayer.  It is a life as
   the friend of God that gives the wonderful liberty to say:  I have a
   friend to whom I can go even at midnight.  And how much more when I go
   in the very spirit of that friendliness, manifesting myself the very
   kindness I look for in God, seeking to help my friend as I want God to
   help me.  When I come to God in prayer, He always looks to what the aim
   is of my petition.  If it be merely for my own comfort or joy I seek
   His grace, I do not receive.  But if I can say that it is that He may
   be glorified in my dispensing His blessings to others, I shall not ask
   in vain.  Or if I ask for others, but want to wait until God has made
   me so rich, that it is no sacrifice or act of faith to aid them, I
   shall not obtain.  But if I can say that I have already undertaken for
   my needy friend, that in my poverty I have already begun the work of
   love, because I know I had a friend Who would help me, my prayer will
   be heard.  Oh, we know not how much the plea avails:  the friendship of
   earth looking in its need to the friendship of heaven:  He will give
   him as much as he needeth.'

   But not always at once.  The one thing by which man can honour and
   enjoy his God is faith.  Intercession is part of faith's
   training-school.  There our friendship with men and with God is
   tested.  There it is seen whether my friendship with the needy is so
   real, that I will take time and sacrifice my rest, will go even at
   midnight and not cease until I have obtained for them what I need.
   There it is seen whether my friendship with God is so clear, that I can
   depend on Him not to turn me away and therefore pray on until He gives.

   O what a deep heavenly mystery this is of persevering prayer.  The God
   who has promised, who longs, whose fixed purpose it is to give the
   blessing, holds it back.  It is to Him a matter of such deep importance
   that His friends on earth should know and fully trust their rich Friend
   in heaven, that He trains them, in the school of answer delayed, to
   find out how their perseverance really does prevail, and what the
   mighty power is they can wield in heaven, if they do but set themselves
   to it.  There is a faith that sees the promise, and embraces it, and
   yet does not receive it (Heb. xi. 13, 39).  It is when the answer to
   prayer does not come, and the promise we are most firmly trusting
   appears to be of none effect, that the trial of faith, more precious
   than of gold, takes place.  It is in this trial that the faith that has
   embraced the promise is purified and strengthened and prepared in
   personal, holy fellowship with the living God, to see the glory of
   God.  It takes and holds the promise until it has received the
   fulfilment of what it had claimed in a living truth in the unseen but
   living God.

   Let each child of God who is seeking to work the work of love in his
   Father's service take courage.  The parent with his child, the teacher
   with his class, the visitor with his district, the Bible reader with
   his circle, the preacher with his hearers, each one who, in his little
   circle, has accepted and is bearing the burden of hungry, perishing
   souls,--let them all take courage.  Nothing is at first so strange to
   us as that God should really require persevering prayer, that there
   should be a real spiritual needs-be for importunity.  To teach it us,
   the Master uses this almost strange parable.  If the unfriendliness of
   a selfish earthly friend can be conquered by importunity, how much more
   will it avail with the heavenly Friend, who does so love to give, but
   is held back by our spiritual unfitness, our incapacity to possess what
   He has to give.  O let us thank Him that in delaying His answer He is
   educating us up to our true position and the exercise of all our power
   with Him, training us to live with Him in the fellowship of undoubting
   faith and trust, to be indeed the friends of God.  And let us hold fast
   the threefold cord that cannot be broken:  the hungry friend needing
   the help, and the praying friend seeking the help, and the Mighty
   Friend, loving to give as much as he needeth.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O my Blessed Lord and Teacher!  I must come to Thee in prayer.  Thy
   teaching is so glorious, and yet too high for me to grasp.  I must
   confess that my heart is too little to take in these thoughts of the
   wonderful boldness I may use with Thy Father as my Friend.  Lord
   Jesus!  I trust Thee to give me Thy Spirit with Thy Word, and to make
   the Word quick and powerful in my heart.  I desire to keep Thy Word of
   this day:  Because of his importunity he will give him as many as he
   needeth.'

   Lord!  teach me more to know the power of persevering prayer.  I know
   that in it the Father suits Himself to our need of time for the inner
   life to attain its growth and ripeness, so that His grace may indeed be
   assimilated and made our very own.  I know that He would fain thus
   train us to the exercise of that strong faith that does not let Him go
   even in the face of seeming disappointment.  I know He wants to lift us
   to that wonderful liberty, in which we understand how really He has
   made the dispensing of His gift dependent on our prayer.  Lord!  I know
   this:  O teach me to see it in spirit and truth.

   And may it now be the joy of my life to become the almoner of my Rich
   Friend in heaven, to care for all the hungry and perishing, even at
   midnight, because I know MY FRIEND, who always gives to him who
   perseveres, because of his importunity, as many as he needeth.  Amen.

NINTH LESSON.

  Pray the Lord of the harvest;'

  Or,          Prayer provides Labourers.

   Then saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but
   the labourers are few.  Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that
   He will send forth labourers into His harvest.'--Matt. ix. 37-38.

   THE Lord frequently taught His disciples that they must pray, and how;
   but seldom what to pray.  This he left to their sense of need, and the
   leading of the Spirit.  But here we have one thing He expressly enjoins
   them to remember:  in view of the plenteous harvest, and the need of
   reapers, they must cry to the Lord of the harvest to send forth
   labourers.  Just as in the parable of the friend at midnight, He would
   have them understand that prayer is not to be selfish; so here it is
   the power through which blessing can come to others.  The Father is
   Lord of the harvest; when we pray for the Holy Spirit, we must pray for
   Him to prepare and send forth labourers for the work.

   Strange, is it not, that He should ask His disciples to pray for this?
   And could He not pray Himself?  And would not one prayer of His avail
   more than a thousand of theirs?  And God, the Lord of the harvest, did
   He not see the need?  And would not He, in His own good time, send
   forth labourers without their prayer?  Such questions lead us up to the
   deepest mysteries of prayer, and its power in the Kingdom of God.  The
   answer to such questions will convince us that prayer is indeed a
   power, on which the ingathering of the harvest and the coming of the
   Kingdom do in very truth depend.

   Prayer is no form or show.  The Lord Jesus was Himself the truth;
   everything He spake was the deepest truth.  It was when (see ver. 36)
   He saw the multitude, and was moved with compassion on them, because
   they were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd,' that He
   called on the disciples to pray for labourers to be sent among them.
   He did so because He really believed that their prayer was needed, and
   would help.  The veil which so hides the invisible world from us was
   wonderfully transparent to the holy human soul of Jesus.  He had looked
   long and deep and far into the hidden connection of cause and effect in
   the spirit world.  He had marked in God's Word how, when God called men
   like Abraham and Moses, Joshua and Samuel and Daniel, and given them
   authority over men in His name, He had at the same time given them
   authority and right to call in the powers of heaven to their aid as
   they needed them.  He knew that as to these men of old, and to Himself
   for a time, here upon earth, the work of God had been entrusted, so it
   was now about to pass over into the hands of His disciples.  He knew
   that when this work should be given in charge to them, it would not be
   a mere matter of form or show, but that on them, and their being
   faithful or unfaithful, the success of the work would actually depend.
   As a single individual, within the limitations of a human body and a
   human life, Jesus feels how little a short visit can accomplish among
   these wandering sheep He sees around Him, and He longs for help to have
   them properly cared for.  And so He tells His disciples now to begin
   and pray, and, when they have taken over the work from Him on earth, to
   make this one of the chief petitions in their prayer:  That the Lord of
   the harvest Himself would send forth labourers into His harvest.  The
   God who entrusted them with the work, and made it to so large extent
   dependent on them, gives them authority to apply to Him for labourers
   to help, and makes the supply dependent on their prayer.

   How little Christians really feel and mourn the need of labourers in
   the fields of the world so white to the harvest.  And how little they
   believe that our labour-supply depends on prayer, that prayer will
   really provide as many as he needeth.'  Not that the dearth of labour
   is not known or discussed.  Not that efforts are not sometimes put
   forth to supply the want.  But how little the burden of the sheep
   wandering without a Shepherd is really borne in the faith that the Lord
   of the harvest will, in answer to prayer, send forth the labourers, and
   in the solemn conviction that without this prayer fields ready for
   reaping will be left to perish.  And yet it is so.  So wonderful is the
   surrender of His work into the hands of His Church, so dependent has
   the Lord made Himself on them as His body, through whom alone His work
   can be done, so real is the power which the Lord gives His people to
   exercise in heaven and earth, that the number of the labourers and the
   measure of the harvest does actually depend upon their prayer.

   Solemn thought!  O why is it that we do not obey the injunction of the
   Master more heartily, and cry more earnestly for labourers?  There are
   two reasons for this.  The one is:  We miss the compassion of Jesus,
   which gave rise to this request for prayer.  When believers learn that
   to love their neighbours as themselves, that to live entirely for God's
   glory in their fellow-men, is the Father's first commandment to His
   redeemed ones, they will accept of the perishing ones as the charge
   entrusted to them by their Lord.  And, accepting them not only as a
   field of labour, but as the objects of loving care and interest, it
   will not be long before compassion towards the hopelessly perishing
   will touch their heart, and the cry ascend with an earnestness till
   then unknown:  Lord!  send labourers.  The other reason for the neglect
   of the command, the want of faith, will then make itself felt, but will
   be overcome as our pity pleads for help.  We believe too little in the
   power of prayer to bring about definite results.  We do not live close
   enough to God, and are not enough entirely given up to His service and
   Kingdom, to be capable of the confidence that He will give it in answer
   to our prayer.  O let us pray for a life so one with Christ, that His
   compassion may stream into us, and His Spirit be able to assure us that
   our prayer avails.

   Such prayer will ask and obtain a twofold blessing.  There will first
   be the desire for the increase of men entirely given up to the service
   of God.  It is a terrible blot upon the Church of Christ that there are
   times when actually men cannot be found for the service of the Master
   as ministers, missionaries, or teachers of God's Word.  As God's
   children make this a matter of supplication for their own circle or
   Church, it will be given.  The Lord Jesus is now Lord of the harvest.
   He has been exalted to bestow gifts--the gifts of the Spirit.  His
   chief gifts are men filled with the Spirit.  But the supply and
   distribution of the gifts depend on the co-operation of Head and
   members.  It is just prayer will lead to such co-operation; the
   believing suppliants will be stirred to find the men and the means for
   the work.

   The other blessing to be asked will not be less.  Every believer is a
   labourer; not one of God's children who has not been redeemed for
   service, and has not his work waiting.  It must be our prayer that the
   Lord would so fill all His people with the spirit of devotion, that not
   one may be found standing idle in the vineyard.  Wherever there is a
   complaint of the want of helpers, or of fit helpers in God's work,
   prayer has the promise of a supply.  There is no Sunday school or
   district visiting, no Bible reading or rescue work, where God is not
   ready and able to provide.  It may take time and importunity, but the
   command of Christ to ask the Lord of the harvest is the pledge that the
   prayer will be heard:  I say unto you, he will arise and give him as
   many as he needeth.'

   Solemn, blessed thought!  this power has been given us in prayer to
   provide in the need of the world, to secure the servants for God's
   work.  The Lord of the harvest will hear.  Christ, who called us so
   specially to pray thus, will support our prayers offered in His name
   and interest.  Let us set apart time and give ourselves to this part of
   our intercessory work.  It will lead us into the fellowship of that
   compassionate heart of His that led Him to call for our prayers.  It
   will elevate us to the insight of our regal position, as those whose
   will counts for something with the great God in the advancement of His
   Kingdom.  It will make us feel how really we are God's fellow-workers
   on earth, to whom a share in His work has in downright earnest been
   entrusted.  It will make us partakers in the soul travail, but also in
   the soul satisfaction of Jesus, as we know how, in answer to our
   prayer, blessing has been given that otherwise would not have come.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord!  Thou hast this day again given us another of Thy
   wondrous lessons to learn.  We humbly ask Thee, O give us to see aright
   the spiritual realities of which Thou hast been speaking.  There is the
   harvest which is so large, and perishing, as it waits for sleepy
   disciples to give the signal for labourers to come.  Lord, teach us to
   look out upon it with a heart moved with compassion and pity.  There
   are the labourers, so few.  Lord, show us how terrible the sin of the
   want of prayer and faith, of which this is the token.  And there is the
   Lord of the harvest, so able and ready to send them forth.  Lord, show
   us how He does indeed wait for the prayer to which He has bound His
   answer.  And there are the disciples, to whom the commission to pray
   has been given:  Lord, show us how Thou canst pour down Thy Spirit and
   breathe upon them, so that Thy compassion and the faith in Thy promise
   shall rouse them to unceasing, prevailing prayer.

   O our Lord!  we cannot understand how Thou canst entrust such work and
   give such power to men so slothful and unfaithful.  We thank Thee for
   all whom Thou art teaching to cry day and night for labourers to be
   sent forth.  Lord, breathe Thine own Spirit on all Thy children, that
   they may learn to live for this one thing alone--the Kingdom and glory
   of their Lord--and become fully awake to the faith of what their prayer
   can accomplish.  And let all our hearts in this, as in every petition,
   be filled with the assurance that prayer, offered in loving faith in
   the living God, will bring certain and abundant answer.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

TENTH LESSON.

  What wilt thou?'

  Or,          Prayer must be Definite.

   And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto
   thee?'--Mark x. 51; Luke xviii. 41.

   THE blind man had been crying out aloud, and that a great deal, Thou
   Son of David, have mercy on me.'  The cry had reached the ear of the
   Lord; He knew what he wanted, and was ready to grant it him.  But ere
   He does it, He asks him:  What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?'
   He wants to hear from his own lips, not only the general petition for
   mercy, but the distinct expression of what his desire was.  Until he
   speaks it out, he is not healed.

   There is now still many a suppliant to whom the Lord puts the same
   question, and who cannot, until it has been answered, get the aid he
   ask.  Our prayers must not be a vague appeal to His mercy, an
   indefinite cry for blessing, but the distinct expression of definite
   need.  Not that His loving heart does not understand our cry, or is not
   ready to hear.  But He desires it for our own sakes.  Such definite
   prayer teaches us to know our own needs better.  It demands time, and
   thought, and self-scrutiny to find out what really is our greatest
   need.  It searches us and puts us to the test as to whether our desires
   are honest and real, such as we are ready to persevere in.  It leads us
   to judge whether our desires are according to God's Word, and whether
   we really believe that we shall receive the things we ask.  It helps us
   to wait for the special answer, and to mark it when it comes.

   And yet how much of our prayer is vague and pointless.  Some cry for
   mercy, but take not the trouble to know what mercy must do for them.
   Others ask, perhaps, to be delivered from sin, but do not begin by
   bringing any sin by name from which the deliverance may be claimed.
   Still others pray for God's blessing on those around them, for the
   outpouring of God's Spirit on their land or the world, and yet have no
   special field where they wait and expect to see the answer.  To all the
   Lord says:  And what is it now you really want and expect Me to do?
   Every Christian has but limited powers, and as he must have his own
   special field of labour in which he works, so with his prayers too.
   Each believer has his own circle, his family, his friends, his
   neighbours.  If he were to take one or more of these by name, he would
   find that this really brings him into the training-school of faith, and
   leads to personal and pointed dealing with his God.  It is when in such
   distinct matters we have in faith claimed and received answers, that
   our more general prayers will be believing and effectual.

   We all know with what surprise the whole civilised world heard of the
   way in which trained troops were repulsed by the Transvaal Boers at
   Majuba.  And to what did they owe their success?  In the armies of
   Europe the soldier fires upon the enemy standing in large masses, and
   never thinks of seeking an aim for every bullet.  In hunting game the
   Boer had learnt a different lesson:  his practised eye knew to send
   every bullet on its special message, to seek and find its man.  Such
   aiming must gain the day in the spiritual world too.  As long as in
   prayer we just pour out our hearts in a multitude of petitions, without
   taking time to see whether every petition is sent with the purpose and
   expectation of getting an answer, not many will reach the mark.  But
   if, as in silence of soul we bow before the Lord, we were to ask such
   questions as these:  What is now really my desire?  do I desire it in
   faith, expecting to receive?  am I now ready to place and leave it in
   the Father's bosom?  is it a settled thing between God and me that I am
   to have the answer?  we should learn so to pray that God would see and
   we would know what we really expect.

   It is for this, among other reasons, that the Lord warns us against the
   vain repetitions of the Gentiles, who think to be heard for their much
   praying.  We often hear prayers of great earnestness and fervour, in
   which a multitude of petitions are poured forth, but to which the
   Saviour would undoubtedly answer What wilt thou that I should do unto
   thee?'  If I am in a strange land, in the interests of the business
   which my father owns, I would certainly write two different sorts of
   letters.  There will be family letters giving expression to all the
   intercourse to which affection prompts; and there will be business
   letters, containing orders for what I need.  And there may be letters
   in which both are found.  The answers will correspond to the letters.
   To each sentence of the letters containing the family news I do not
   expect a special answer.  But for each order I send I am confident of
   an answer whether the desired article has been forwarded.  In our
   dealings with God the business element must not be wanting.  With our
   expression of need and sin, of love and faith and consecration, there
   must be the pointed statement of what we ask and expect to receive; it
   is in the answer that the Father loves to give us the token of His
   approval and acceptance.

   But the word of the Master teaches us more.  He does not say, What dost
   thou wish? but, What does thou will?  One often wishes for a thing
   without willing it.  I wish to have a certain article, but I find the
   price too high; I resolve not to take it; I wish, but do not will to
   have it.  The sluggard wishes to be rich, but does not will it.  Many a
   one wishes to be saved, but perishes because he does not will it.  The
   will rules the whole heart and life; if I really will to have anything
   that is within my reach, I do not rest till I have it.  And so, when
   Jesus says to us, What wilt thou?' He asks whether it is indeed our
   purpose to have what we ask at any price, however great the sacrifice.
   Dost thou indeed so will to have it that, though He delay it long, thou
   dost not hold thy peace till He hear thee?  Alas! how many prayers are
   wishes, sent up for a short time and then forgotten, or sent up year
   after year as matter of duty, while we rest content with the prayer
   without the answer.

   But, it may be asked, is it not best to make our wishes known to God,
   and then to leave it to Him to decide what is best, without seeking to
   assert our will?  By no means.  This is the very essence of the prayer
   of faith, to which Jesus sought to train His disciples, that it does
   not only make known its desire and then leave the decision to God.
   That would be the prayer of submission, for cases in which we cannot
   know God's will.  But the prayer of faith, finding God's will in some
   promise of the Word, pleads for that till it come.  In Matthew (ix. 28)
   we read Jesus said to the blind man:  Believe ye that I can do this?'
   Here, in Mark, He says:  What wilt thou that I should do?'  In both
   cases He said that faith had saved them.  And so He said to the
   Syrophenician woman, too:  Great is thy faith:  be it unto thee even as
   thou wilt.'  Faith is nothing but the purpose of the will resting on
   God's word, and saying:  I must have it.  To believe truly is to will
   firmly.

   But is not such a will at variance with our dependence on God and our
   submission to Him?  By no means; it is much rather the true submission
   that honours God.  It is only when the child has yielded his own will
   in entire surrender to the Father, that he receives from the Father
   liberty and power to will what he would have.  But, when once the
   believer has accepted the will of God, as revealed through the Word and
   Spirit, as his will, too, then it is the will of God that His child
   should use this renewed will in His service.  The will is the highest
   power in the soul; grace wants above everything to sanctify and restore
   this will, one of the chief traits of God's image, to full and free
   exercise.  As a son, who only lives for his father's interests, who
   seeks not his own but his father's will is trusted by the father with
   his business, so God speaks to His child in all truth, What wilt
   thou?'  It is often spiritual sloth that, under the appearance of
   humility, professes to have no will, because it fears the trouble of
   searching out the will of God, or, when found, the struggle of claiming
   it in faith.  True humility is ever in company with strong faith, which
   only seeks to know what is according to the will of God, and then
   boldly claims the fulfilment of the promise:  Ye shall ask what ye
   will, and it shall be done unto you.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Lord Jesus!  teach me to pray with all my heart and strength, that
   there may be no doubt with Thee or with me as to what I have asked.
   May I so know what I desire that, even as my petitions are recorded in
   heaven, I can record them on earth too, and note each answer as it
   comes.  And may my faith in what Thy Word has promised be so clear that
   the Spirit may indeed work in me the liberty to will that it shall
   come.  Lord!  renew, strengthen, sanctify wholly my will for the work
   of effectual prayer.

   Blessed Saviour!  I do beseech Thee to reveal to me the wonderful
   condescension Thou showest us, thus asking us to say what we will that
   Thou shouldest do, and promising to do whatever we will.  Son of God!
   I cannot understand it; I can only believe that Thou hast indeed
   redeemed us wholly for Thyself, and dost seek to make the will, as our
   noblest part, Thy most efficient servant.  Lord!  I do most
   unreservedly yield my will to Thee, as the power through which Thy
   Spirit is to rule my whole being.  Let Him take possession of it, lead
   it into the truth of Thy promises, and make it so strong in prayer that
   I may ever hear Thy voice saying:  Great is thy faith:  be it unto thee
   even as thou wilt.'  Amen.

ELEVENTH LESSON.

  Believe that ye have received;'

  Or,    The Faith that Takes.

   Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for,
   believe that ye have received them, and ye shall have them.'--Mark xi.
   24

   WHAT a promise!  so large, so Divine, that our little hearts cannot
   take it in, and in every possible way seek to limit it to what we think
   safe or probable; instead of allowing it, in its quickening power and
   energy, just as He gave it, to enter in, and to enlarge our hearts to
   the measure of what His love and power are really ready to do for us.
   Faith is very far from being a mere conviction of the truth of God's
   word, or a conclusion drawn from certain premises.  It is the ear which
   has heard God say what He will do, the eye which has seen Him doing it,
   and, therefore, where there is true faith, it is impossible but the
   answer must come.  If we only see to it that we do the one thing that
   He asks of us as we pray:  BELIEVE that ye have received; He will see
   to it that He does the thing He has promised:  Ye shall have them.'
   The key-note of Solomon's prayer (2 Chron. vi. 4), Blessed be the Lord
   God of Israel, who hath with His hands fulfilled that which He spake
   with His mouth to my father David,' is the key-note of all true
   prayer:  the joyful adoration of a God whose hand always secures the
   fulfilment of what His mouth hath spoken.  Let us in this spirit listen
   to the promise Jesus gives; each part of it has its Divine message.

   All things whatsoever.'  At this first word our human wisdom at once
   begins to doubt and ask:  This surely cannot be literally true?  But if
   it be not, why did the Master speak it, using the very strongest
   expression He could find:  All things whatsoever.'  And it is not as if
   this were the only time He spoke thus; is it not He who also said, If
   thou canst believe, ALL THINGS are possible to him that believeth;'  If
   ye have faith, NOTHING shall be impossible to you.'  Faith is so wholly
   the work of God's Spirit through His word in the prepared heart of the
   believing disciple, that it is impossible that the fulfilment should
   not come; faith is the pledge and forerunner of the coming answer.
   Yes, ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye
   receive.'  The tendency of human reason is to interpose here, and with
   certain qualifying clauses, if expedient,' if according to God's will,'
   to break the force of a statement which appears dangerous.  O let us
   beware of dealing thus with the Master's words.   His promise is most
   literally true.  He wants His oft repeated ALL THINGS' to enter into
   our hearts, and reveal to us how mighty the power of faith is, how
   truly the Head calls the members to share with Him in His power, how
   wholly our Father places His power at the disposal of the child that
   wholly trusts Him.  In this all things' faith is to have its food and
   strength:  as we weaken it we weaken faith.  The WHATSOEVER is
   unconditional:  the only condition is what is implied in the
   believing.  Ere we can believe we must find out and know what God's
   will is' believing is the exercise of a soul surrendered and given up
   to the influence of the Word and the Spirit; but when once we do
   believe nothing shall be impossible.  God forbid that we should try and
   bring down His ALL THINGS to the level of what we think possible.  Let
   us now simply take Christ's WHATSOEVER' as the measure and the hope of
   our faith:  it is a seed-word which, if taken just as He gives it, and
   kept in the heart, will unfold itself and strike root, fill our life
   with its fulness, and bring forth fruit abundantly.

   All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for.'  It is in prayer that these
   all things' are to be brought to God, to be asked and received of Him.
   The faith that receives them is the fruit of the prayer.  In one aspect
   there must be faith before there can be prayer; in another the faith is
   the outcome and the growth of prayer.  It is in the personal presence
   of the Saviour, in intercourse with Him, that faith rises to grasp what
   at first appeared too high.  It is in prayer that we hold up our desire
   to the light of God's Holy Will, that our motives are tested, and proof
   given whether we ask indeed in the name of Jesus, and only for the
   glory of God.  It is in prayer that we wait for the leading of the
   Spirit to show us whether we are asking the right thing and in the
   right spirit.  It is in prayer that we become conscious of our want of
   faith, that we are led on to say to the Father that we do believe, and
   that we prove the reality of our faith by the confidence with which we
   persevere.  It is in prayer that Jesus teaches and inspires faith.  He
   that waits to pray, or loses heart in prayer, because he does not yet
   feel the faith needed to get the answer, will never learn to believe.
   He who begins to pray and ask will find the Spirit of faith is given
   nowhere so surely as at the foot of the Throne.

   Believe that ye have received.'  It is clear that what we are to
   believe is, that we receive the very things we ask.  The Saviour does
   not hint that because the Father knows what is best He may give us
   something else.  The very mountain faith bids depart is cast into the
   sea.  There is a prayer in which, in everything, we make known our
   requests with prayer and supplication, and the reward is the sweet
   peace of God keeping heart and mind.  This is the prayer of trust. It
   has reference to things of which we cannot find out if God is going to
   give them.  As children we make known our desires in the countless
   things of daily life, and leave it to the Father to give or not as He
   thinks best.  But the prayer of faith of which Jesus speaks is
   something different, something higher.  When, whether in the greater
   interests of the Master's work, or in the lesser concerns of our daily
   life, the soul is led to see how there is nothing that so honours the
   Father as the faith that is assured that He will do what He has said in
   giving us whatsoever we ask for, and takes its stand on the promise as
   brought home by the Spirit, it may know most certainly that it does
   receive exactly what it asks.  Just see how clearly the Lord sets this
   before us in verse 23:  Whosoever shall not doubt in his heart, but
   shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass, he shall have it.'
   This is the blessing of the prayer of faith of which Jesus speaks.

   Believe that ye have received.'  This is the word of central
   importance, of which the meaning is too often misunderstood.  Believe
   that you have received! now, while praying, the thing you ask for.  It
   may only be later that you shall have it in personal experience, that
   you shall see what you believe; but now, without seeing, you are to
   believe that it has been given you of the Father in heaven.  The
   receiving or accepting of an answer to prayer is just like the
   receiving or accepting of Jesus or of pardon, a spiritual thing, an act
   of faith apart from all feeling.  When I come as a supplicant for
   pardon, I believe that Jesus in heaven is for me, and so I receive or
   take Him.  When I come as a supplicant for any special gift, which is
   according to God's word, I believe that what I ask is given me:  I
   believe that I have it, I hold it in faith; I thank God that it is
   mine.  If we know that He heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that
   we have the petitions which we have asked of Him.'

   And ye shall have them.'  That is, the gift which we first hold in
   faith as bestowed upon us in heaven will also become ours in personal
   experience.  But will it be needful to pray longer if once we know we
   have been heard and have received what we asked?  There are cases in
   which such prayer will not be needful, in which the blessing is ready
   to break through at once, if we but hold fast our confidence, and prove
   our faith by praising for what we have received, in the face of our not
   yet having it in experience.  There are other cases in which the faith
   that has received needs to be still further tried and strengthened in
   persevering prayer.  God only knows when everything in and around us is
   fully ripe for the manifestation of the blessing that has been given to
   faith.  Elijah knew for certain that rain would come; God had promised
   it; and yet he had to pray the seven times.  And that prayer was no
   show or play; an intense spiritual reality in the heart of him who lay
   pleading there, and in the heaven above where it had its effectual work
   to do.  It is through faith and patience we inherit the promises.'
   Faith says most confidently, I have received it.  Patience perseveres
   in prayer until the gift bestowed in heaven is seen on earth.  Believe
   that ye have received, and ye shall have.'  Between the have received
   in heaven, and the shall have of earth, believe:  believing praise and
   prayer is the link.

   And now, remember one thing more:  It is Jesus who said this.  As we
   see heaven thus opened to us, and the Father on the Throne offering to
   give us whatsoever we ask in faith, our hearts feel full of shame that
   we have so little availed ourselves of our privilege, and full of fear
   lest our feeble faith still fail to grasp what is so clearly placed
   within our reach.  There is one thing must make us strong and full of
   hope:  it is Jesus who has brought us this message from the Father.  He
   Himself, when He was on earth, lived the life of faith and prayer.  It
   was when the disciples expressed their surprise at what He had done to
   the fig-tree, that He told them that the very same life He led could be
   theirs; that they could not only command the fig-tree, but the very
   mountain, and it must obey.  And He is our life:  all He was on earth
   He is in us now; all He teaches He really gives.  He is Himself the
   Author and the Perfecter of our faith:  He gives the spirit of faith;
   let us not be afraid that such faith is not meant for us.  It is meant
   for every child of the Father; it is within reach of each one who will
   but be childlike, yielding himself to the Father's Will and Love,
   trusting the Father's Word and Power.  Dear fellow-Christian! let the
   thought that this word comes through Jesus, the Son, our Brother, give
   us courage, and let our answer be:  Yea, Blessed Lord, we do believe
   Thy Word, we do believe that we receive.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord!  Thou didst come from the Father to show us all His love,
   and all the treasures of blessing that love is waiting to bestow.
   Lord!  Thou hast this day again flung the gates so wide open, and given
   us such promises as to our liberty in prayer, that we must blush that
   our poor hearts have so little taken it in.  It has been too large for
   us to believe.

   Lord! we now look up to Thee to teach us to take and keep and use this
   precious word of Thine:  All things whatsoever ye ask, believe that ye
   have received.'  Blessed Jesus! it is Thy self in whom our faith must
   be rooted if it is to grow strong.  Thy work has freed us wholly from
   the power of sin, and opened the way to the Father; Thy Love is ever
   longing to bring us into the full fellowship of Thy glory and power;
   Thy Spirit is ever drawing us upward into a life of perfect faith and
   confidence; we are assured that in Thy teaching we shall learn to pray
   the prayer of faith.  Thou wilt train us to pray so that we believe
   that we receive, to believe that we really have what we ask.  Lord!
   teach me so to know and trust and love Thee, so to live and abide in
   Thee, that all my prayers rise up and come before God in Thee, and that
   my soul may have in Thee the assurance that I am heard.  Amen.

TWELFTH LESSON.

  Have faith in God;'

  Or,    The Secret of Believing Prayer.

   Jesus, answering, said unto them, Have faith in God.  Verily I say unto
   you, Whosoever shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that
   what He saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.  Therefore I say unto
   you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have
   received them, and ye shall have them.'--Mark xi. 22-24.

   THE promise of answer to prayer which formed our yesterday's lesson is
   one of the most wonderful in all Scripture.  In how many hearts it has
   raised the question:  How ever can I attain the faith that knows that
   it receives all it asks?

   It is this question our Lord would answer today.  Ere He gave that
   wonderful promise to His disciples, He spoke another word, in which He
   points out where the faith in the answer to prayer takes its rise, and
   ever finds its strength.  HAVE FAITH IN GOD:  this word precedes the
   other, Have faith in the promise of an answer to prayer.  The power to
   believe a promise depends entirely, but only, on faith in the
   promiser.  Trust in the person begets trust in his word.  It is only
   where we live and associate with God in personal, loving intercourse,
   where GOD HIMSELF is all to us, where our whole being is continually
   opened up and exposed to the mighty influences that are at work where
   His Holy Presence is revealed, that the capacity will be developed for
   believing that He gives whatsoever we ask.

   This connection between faith in God and faith in His promise will
   become clear to us if we think what faith really is.  It is often
   compared to the hand or the mouth, by which we take and appropriate
   what is offered to us.  But it is of importance that we should
   understand that faith is also the ear by which I hear what is promised,
   the eye by which I see what is offered me.  On this the power to take
   depends.  I must hear the person who gives me the promise:  the very
   tone of his voice gives me courage to believe.  I must see him:  in the
   light of his eye and countenance all fear as to my right to take passes
   away.  The value of the promise depends on the promiser:  it is on my
   knowledge of what the promiser is that faith in the promise depends.

   It is for this reason that Jesus, ere He gives that wonderful
   prayer-promise, first says, HAVE FAITH IN GOD.'  That is, let thine eye
   be open to the Living God, and gaze on Him, seeing Him who is
   Invisible.  It is through the eye that I yield myself to the influence
   of what is before me; I just allow it to enter, to exert its influence,
   to leave its impression upon my mind.  So believing God is just looking
   to God and what He is, allowing Him to reveal His presence, giving Him
   time and yielding the whole being to take in the full impression of
   what He is as God, the soul opened up to receive and rejoice in the
   overshadowing of His love.  Yes, faith is the eye to which God shows
   what He is and does:  through faith the light of His presence and the
   workings of His mighty power stream into the soul.  As that which I see
   lives in me, so by faith God lives in me too.

   And even so faith is also the ear through which the voice of God is
   always heard and intercourse with Him kept up.  It is through the Holy
   Spirit the Father speaks to us; the Son is the Word, the substance of
   what God says; the Spirit is the living voice.  This the child of God
   needs to lead and guide him; the secret voice from heaven must teach
   him, as it taught Jesus, what to say and what to do.  An ear opened
   towards God, that is, a believing heart waiting on Him, to hear what He
   says, will hear Him speak.  The words of God will not only be the words
   of a Book, but, proceeding from the mouth of God, they will be spirit
   and truth, life and power.  They will bring in deed and living
   experience what are otherwise only thoughts.  Through this opened ear
   the soul tarries under the influence of the life and power of God
   Himself.  As the words I hear enter the mind and dwell and work there,
   so through faith God enters the heart, and dwells and works there.

   When faith now is in full exercise as eye and ear, as the faculty of
   the soul by which we see and hear God, then it will be able to exercise
   its full power as hand and mouth, by which we appropriate God and His
   blessing.  The power of reception will depend entirely on the power of
   spiritual perception.  For this reason Jesus said, ere He gave the
   promise that God would answer believing prayer:  HAVE FAITH IN GOD.'
   Faith is simply surrender:  I yield myself to the impression the
   tidings I hear make on me.  By faith I yield myself to the living God.
   His glory and love fill my heart, and have the mastery over my life.
   Faith is fellowship; I give myself up to the influence of the friend
   who makes me a promise, and become linked to him by it.  And it is when
   we enter into this living fellowship with God Himself, in a faith that
   always sees and hears Him, that it becomes easy and natural to believe
   His promise as to prayer.  Faith in the promise is the fruit of faith
   in the promiser:  the prayer of faith is rooted in the life of faith.
   And in this way the faith that prays effectually is indeed a gift of
   God.  Not as something that He bestows or infuses at once, but in a far
   deeper and truer sense, as the blessed disposition or habit of soul
   which is wrought and grows up in us in a life of intercourse with Him.
   Surely for one who knows his Father well, and lives in constant close
   intercourse with Him, it is a simple thing to believe the promise that
   He will do the will of His child who lives in union with Himself.

   It is because very many of God's children do not understand this
   connection between the life of faith and the prayer of faith that their
   experience of the power of prayer is so limited.  When they desire
   earnestly to obtain an answer from God, they fix their whole heart upon
   the promise, and try their utmost to grasp that promise in faith.  When
   they do not succeed, they are ready to give up hope; the promise is
   true, but it is beyond their power to take hold of it in faith.  Listen
   to the lesson Jesus teaches us this day:  HAVE FAITH IN GOD, the Living
   God:  let faith look to God more than the thing promised:  it is His
   love, His power, His living presence will waken and work the faith.  A
   physician would say to one asking for some means to get more strength
   in his arms and hands to seize and hold, that his whole constitution
   must be built up and strengthened.  So the cure of a feeble faith is
   alone to be found in the invigoration of our whole spiritual life by
   intercourse with God.  Learn to believe in God, to take hold of God, to
   let God take possession of thy life, and it will be easy to take hold
   of the promise.  He that knows and trusts God finds it easy to trust
   the promise too.

   Just note how distinctly this comes out in the saints of old.  Every
   special exhibition of the power of faith was the fruit of a special
   revelation of God.  See it in Abraham:  And the word of the Lord came
   unto Abram, saying, Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield.  And He brought
   him forth abroad, and said . . . AND HE BELIEVED THE LORD.'  And later
   again:  The Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, I am God
   Almighty.  And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,
   As for me, behold my covenant is with thee.'  It was the revelation of
   God Himself that gave the promise its living power to enter the heart
   and work the faith.  Because they knew God, these men of faith could
   not do anything but trust His promise.  God's promise will be to us
   what God Himself is.  It is the man who walks before the Lord, and
   falls upon his face to listen while the living God speaks to him, who
   will really receive the promise.  Though we have God's promises in the
   Bible, with full liberty to take them, the spiritual power is wanting,
   except as God Himself speaks them to us.  And He speaks to those who
   walk and live with Him.  Therefore, HAVE FAITH IN GOD:  let faith be
   all eye and ear, the surrender to let God make His full impression, and
   reveal Himself fully in the soul.  Count it one of the chief blessings
   of prayer to exercise faith in God, as the Living Mighty God who waits
   to fulfil in us all the good pleasure of His will, and the work of
   faith with power.  See in Him the God of Love, whose delight it is to
   bless and impart Himself.  In such worship of faith in God the power
   will speedily come to believe the promise too:  ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER
   YE ASK, BELIEVE THAT YE RECEIVE.'  Yes, see that thou dost in faith
   make God thine own; the promise will be thine too.

   Precious lessons that Jesus has to teach us this day.  We seek God's
   gifts:  God wants to give us HIMSELF first.  We think of prayer as the
   power to draw down good gifts from heaven; Jesus as the means to draw
   ourselves up to God.  We want to stand at the door and cry; Jesus would
   have us first enter in and realize that we are friends and children.
   Let us accept the teaching.  Let every experience of the littleness of
   our faith in prayer urge us first to have and exercise more faith in
   the living God, and in such faith to yield ourselves to Him.  A heart
   full of God has power for the prayer of faith.  Faith in God begets
   faith in the promise, in the promise too of an answer to prayer.

   Therefore, child of God, take time, take time, to bow before Him, to
   wait on Him to reveal Himself.  Take time, and let thy soul in holy awe
   and worship exercise and express its faith in the Infinite One, and as
   He imparts Himself and takes possession of thee, the prayer of faith
   will crown thy faith in God.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O my God! I do believe in Thee.  I believe in Thee as the Father,
   Infinite in Thy Love and Power.  And as the Son, my Redeemer and my
   Life.  And as the Holy Spirit, Comforter and Guide and Strength.
   Three-One God, I have faith in Thee.  I know and am sure that all that
   Thou art Thou art to me, that all Thou hast promised Thou wilt perform.

   Lord Jesus! increase this faith.  Teach me to take time, and wait and
   worship in the Holy Presence until my faith takes in all there is in my
   God for me.  Let it see Him as the Fountain of all Life, working with
   Almighty Strength to accomplish His will on the world and in me.  Let
   it see Him in His love longing to meet and fulfil my desires.  Let it
   so take possession of my heart and life that through faith God alone
   may dwell there.  Lord Jesus, help me! with my whole heart would I
   believe in God.  Let faith in God each moment fill me.

   O my Blessed Saviour! how can Thy Church glorify Thee, how can it
   fulfil that work of intercession through which Thy kingdom must come,
   unless our whole life be FAITH IN GOD. Blessed Lord! speak Thy Word,
   HAVE FAITH IN GOD,' unto the depths of our souls.

THIRTEENTH LESSON.

  Prayer and fasting;'

  Or,    The Cure of Unbelief.

     Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we
   cast him out?  And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief:  for
   verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
   nothing shall be impossible to you.  Howbeit this kind goeth not out
   but by prayer and fasting'--Matt. xvii. 19-21.

   WHEN the disciples saw Jesus cast the evil spirit out of the epileptic
   whom they could not cure,' they asked the Master for the cause of their
   failure.  He had given them power and authority over all devils, and to
   cure all diseases.'  They had often exercised that power, and joyfully
   told how the devils were subject to them.  And yet now, while He was on
   the Mount, they had utterly failed.  That there had been nothing in the
   will of God or in the nature of the case to render deliverance
   impossible, had been proved:  at Christ's bidding the evil spirit had
   gone out.  From their expression, Why could we not?' it is evident that
   they had wished and sought to do so; they had probably used the
   Master's name, and called upon the evil spirit to go out.  Their
   efforts had been vain, and in presence of the multitude, they had been
   put to shame.  Why could we not?'

   Christ's answer was direct and plain:  Because of your unbelief.'  The
   cause of His success and their failure, was not owing to His having a
   special power to which they had no access.  No; the reason was not far
   to seek.  He had so often taught them that there is one power, that of
   faith, to which, in the kingdom of darkness, as in the kingdom of God,
   everything must bow; in the spiritual world failure has but one cause,
   the want of faith.  Faith is the one condition on which all Divine
   power can enter into man and work through him.  It is the
   susceptibility of the unseen:  man's will yielded up to, and moulded
   by, the will of God.  The power they had received to cast out devils,
   they did not hold in themselves as a permanent gift or possession; the
   power was in Christ, to be received, and held, and used by faith alone,
   living faith in Himself.  Had they been full of faith in Him as Lord
   and Conqueror in the spirit-world, had they been full of faith in Him
   as having given them authority to cast out in His name, this faith
   would have given them the victory.  Because of your unbelief' was, for
   all time, the Master's explanation and reproof of impotence and failure
   in His Church.

   But such want of faith must have a cause too.  Well might the disciples
   have asked:  And why could we not believe?  Our faith has cast out
   devils before this:  why have we now failed in believing?  The Master
   proceeds to tell them ere they ask:  This kind goeth not out but by
   fasting and prayer.'  As faith is the simplest, so it is the highest
   exercise of the spiritual life, where our spirit yields itself in
   perfect receptivity to God's Spirit and so is strengthened to its
   highest activity.  This faith depends entirely upon the state of the
   spiritual life; only when this is strong and in full health, when the
   Spirit of God has full sway in our life, is there the power of faith to
   do its mighty deeds.  And therefore Jesus adds:  Howbeit this kind
   goeth not out but by fasting and prayer.'  The faith that can overcome
   such stubborn resistance as you have just seen in this evil spirit,
   Jesus tells them, is not possible except to men living in very close
   fellowship with God, and in very special separation from the world--in
   prayer and fasting.  And so He teaches us two lessons in regard to
   prayer of deep importance.  The one, that faith needs a life of prayer
   in which to grow and keep strong.  The other, that prayer needs fasting
   for its full and perfect development.

   Faith needs a life of prayer for its full growth.  In all the different
   parts of the spiritual life, there is such close union, such unceasing
   action and re-action, that each may be both cause and effect.  Thus it
   is with faith.  There can be no true prayer without faith; some measure
   of faith must precede prayer.  And yet prayer is also the way to more
   faith; there can be no higher degrees of faith except through much
   prayer.  This is the lesson Jesus teaches here.  There is nothing needs
   so much to grow as our faith.  Your faith groweth exceedingly,' is said
   of one Church.  When Jesus spoke the words, According to your faith be
   it unto you,' He announced the law of the kingdom, which tells us that
   all have not equal degrees of faith, that the same person has not
   always the same degree, and that the measure of faith must always
   determine the measure of power and of blessing.  If we want to know
   where and how our faith is to grow, the Master points us to the throne
   of God.  It is in prayer, in the exercise of the faith I have, in
   fellowship with the living God, that faith can increase.  Faith can
   only live by feeding on what is Divine, on God Himself.

   It is in the adoring worship of God, the waiting on Him and for Him,
   the deep silence of soul that yields itself for God to reveal Himself,
   that the capacity for knowing and trusting God will be developed.  It
   is as we take His word from the Blessed Book, and bring it to Himself,
   asking him to speak it to us with His living loving voice, that the
   power will come fully to believe and receive the word as God's own word
   to us.  It is in prayer, in living contact with God in living faith,
   that faith, the power to trust God, and in that trust, to accept
   everything He says, to accept every possibility He has offered to our
   faith will become strong in us.  Many Christians cannot understand what
   is meant by the much prayer they sometimes hear spoken of:  they can
   form no conception, nor do they feel the need, of spending hours with
   God.  But what the Master says, the experience of His people has
   confirmed:  men of strong faith are men of much prayer.

   This just brings us back again to the lesson we learned when Jesus,
   before telling us to believe that we receive what we ask, first said,
   Have faith in God.'  It is God, the living God, into whom our faith
   must strike its roots deep and broad; then it will be strong to remove
   mountains and cast out devils.  If ye have faith, nothing shall be
   impossible to you.'  Oh! if we do but give ourselves up to the work God
   has for us in the world, coming into contact with the mountains and the
   devils there are to be cast away and cast out, we should soon
   comprehend the need there is of much faith, and of much prayer, as the
   soil in which alone faith can be cultivated.  Christ Jesus is our life,
   the life of our faith too.  It is His life in us that makes us strong,
   and makes us simple to believe.  It is in the dying to self which much
   prayer implies, in closer union to Jesus, that the spirit of faith will
   come in power.  Faith needs prayer for its full growth.

   And prayer needs fasting for its full growth:  this is the second
   lesson.  Prayer is the one hand with which we grasp the invisible;
   fasting, the other, with which we let loose and cast away the visible.
   In nothing is man more closely connected with the world of sense than
   in his need of food, and his enjoyment of it.  It was the fruit, good
   for food, with which man was tempted and fell in Paradise.  It was with
   bread to be made of stones that Jesus, when an hungered, was tempted in
   the wilderness, and in fasting that He triumphed.  The body has been
   redeemed to be a temple of the Holy Spirit; it is in body as well as
   spirit, it is very specially, Scripture says, in eating and drinking,
   we are to glorify God.  It is to be feared that there are many
   Christians to whom this eating to the glory of God has not yet become a
   spiritual reality.  And the first thought suggested by Jesus' words in
   regard to fasting and prayer, is, that it is only in a life of
   moderation and temperance and self-denial that there will be the heart
   or the strength to pray much.

   But then there is also its more literal meaning.  Sorrow and anxiety
   cannot eat:  joy celebrates its feasts with eating and drinking.  There
   may come times of intense desire, when it is strongly felt how the
   body, with its appetites, lawful though they be, still hinder the
   spirit in its battle with the powers of darkness, and the need is felt
   of keeping it under.  We are creatures of the senses:  our mind is
   helped by what comes to us embodied in concrete form; fasting helps to
   express, to deepen, and to confirm the resolution that we are ready to
   sacrifice anything, to sacrifice ourselves, to attain what we seek for
   the kingdom of God.  And He who accepted the fasting and sacrifice of
   the Son, knows to value and accept and reward with spiritual power the
   soul that is thus ready to give up all for Christ and His kingdom.

   And then follows a still wider application.  Prayer is the reaching out
   after God and the unseen; fasting, the letting go of all that is of the
   seen and temporal.  While ordinary Christians imagine that all that is
   not positively forbidden and sinful is lawful to them, and seek to
   retain as much as possible of this world, with its property, its
   literature, its enjoyments, the truly consecrated soul is as the
   soldier who carries only what he needs for the warfare.  Laying aside
   every weight, as well as the easily besetting sin, afraid of entangling
   himself with the affairs of this life, he seeks to lead a Nazarite
   life, as one specially set apart for the Lord and His service.  Without
   such voluntary separation, even from what is lawful, no one will attain
   power in prayer:  this kind goeth not out but by fasting and prayer.

   Disciples of Jesus! who have asked the Master to teach you to pray,
   come now and accept His lessons.  He tells you that prayer is the path
   to faith, strong faith, that can cast out devils.  He tells you:  If ye
   have faith, nothing shall be impossible to you;' let this glorious
   promise encourage you to pray much.  Is the prize not worth the price?
   Shall we not give up all to follow Jesus in the path He opens to us
   here; shall we not, if need be, fast?  Shall we not do anything that
   neither the body nor the world around hinder us in our great
   life-work,--having intercourse with our God in prayer, that we may
   become men of faith, whom He can use in His work of saving the world.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O Lord Jesus! how continually Thou hast to reprove us for our
   unbelief!  How strange it must appear to Thee, this terrible incapacity
   of trusting our Father and His promises.  Lord! let Thy reproof, with
   its searching, Because of your unbelief,' sink into the very depths of
   our hearts, and reveal to us how much of the sin and suffering around
   us is our blame.  And then teach us, Blessed Lord, that there is a
   place where faith can be learned and gained,--even in the prayer and
   fasting that brings into living and abiding fellowship with Thyself and
   the Father.

   O Saviour! Thou Thyself art the Author and the Perfecter of our faith;
   teach us what it is to let Thee live in us by Thy Holy Spirit.  Lord!
   our efforts and prayers for grace to believe have been so unavailing.
   We know why it was:  we sought for strength in ourselves to be given
   from Thee.  Holy Jesus! do at length teach us the mystery of Thy life
   in us, and how Thou, by Thy Spirit, dost undertake to live in us the
   life of faith, to see to it that our faith shall not fail.  O let us
   see that our faith will just be a part of that wonderful prayer-life
   which Thou givest in them who expect their training for the ministry of
   intercession, not in word and thought only, but in the Holy Unction
   Thou givest, the inflowing of the Spirit of Thine own life.  And teach
   us how, in fasting and prayer, we may grow up to the faith to which
   nothing shall be impossible.  Amen.

   NOTE

   At the time when Blumhardt was passing through his terrible conflict
   with the evil spirits in those who were possessed, and seeking to cast
   them out by prayer, he often wondered what it was that hindered the
   answer.  One day a friend, to whom he had spoken of his trouble,
   directed his attention to our Lord's words about fasting.  Blumhardt
   resolved to give himself to fasting, sometimes for more than thirty
   hours.  From reflection and experience he gained the conviction that it
   is of more importance than is generally thought.  He says, Inasmuch as
   the fasting is before God, a practical proof that the thing we ask is
   to us a matter of true and pressing interest, and inasmuch as in a high
   degree it strengthens the intensity and power of the prayer, and
   becomes the unceasing practical expression of a prayer without words, I
   could believe that it would not be without efficacy, especially as the
   Master's words had reference to a case like the present.  I tried it,
   without telling any one, and in truth the later conflict was
   extraordinarily lightened by it.  I could speak with much greater
   restfulness and decision.  I did not require to be so long present with
   the sick one; and I felt that I could influence without being present.'
     __________________________________________________________________

FOURTEENTH LESSON.

  When ye stand praying, forgive;'

  Or,          Prayer and Love.

   And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive,  if ye have aught against any
   one; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
   trespasses.'--Mark xi. 25.

   THESE words follow immediately on the great prayer-promise, All things
   whatsoever ye pray, believe that ye have received them, and ye shall
   have them.'  We have already seen how the words that preceded that
   promise, Have faith in God,' taught us that in prayer all depends upon
   our relation to God being clear; these words that follow on it remind
   us that our relation with fellow-men must be clear too.  Love to God
   and love to our neighbour are inseparable:  the prayer from a heart,
   that is either not right with God on the one side, or with men on the
   other, cannot prevail.  Faith and love are essential to each other.

   We find that this is a thought to which our Lord frequently gave
   expression.  In the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. v. 23, 24), when
   speaking of the sixth commandment, He taught His disciples how
   impossible acceptable worship to the Father was if everything were not
   right with the brother:  If thou art offering thy gift at the altar,
   and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave
   there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to
   thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.'  And so later, when
   speaking of prayer to God, after having taught us to pray, Forgive us
   our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors,' He added at the close
   of the prayer:  If you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
   your Father forgive your trespasses.'  At the close of the parable of
   the unmerciful servant He applies His teaching in the words:  So shall
   also my Heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his
   brother from your hearts.'  And so here, beside the dried-up fig-tree,
   where He speaks of the wonderful power of faith and the prayer of
   faith, He all at once, apparently without connection, introduces the
   thought, Whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against
   any one; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
   trespasses.'  It is as if the Lord had learned during His life at
   Nazareth and afterwards that disobedience to the law of love to men was
   the great sin even of praying people, and the great cause of the
   feebleness of their prayer.  And it is as if He wanted to lead us into
   His own blessed experience that nothing gives such liberty of access
   and such power in believing as the consciousness that we have given
   ourselves in love and compassion, for those whom God loves.

   The first lesson taught here is that of a forgiving disposition.  We
   pray, Forgive, even as we have forgiven.'  Scripture says, Forgive one
   another, even as God also in Christ forgave you.'  God's full and free
   forgiveness is to be the rule of ours with men.  Otherwise our
   reluctant, half-hearted forgiveness, which is not forgiveness at all,
   will be God's rule with us.   Every prayer rests upon our faith in
   God's pardoning grace.  If God dealt with us after our sins, not one
   prayer could be heard.  Pardon opens the door to all God's love and
   blessing:  because God has pardoned all our sin, our prayer can prevail
   to obtain all we need.  The deep sure ground of answer to prayer is
   God's forgiving love.  When it has taken possession of the heart, we
   pray in faith.  But also, when it has taken possession of the heart, we
   live in love.  God's forgiving disposition, revealed in His love to us,
   becomes a disposition in us; as the power of His forgiving love shed
   abroad and dwelling within us, we forgive even as He forgives.  If
   there be great and grievous injury or injustice done us, we seek first
   of all to possess a Godlike disposition; to be kept from a sense of
   wounded honour, from a desire to maintain our rights, or from rewarding
   the offender as he has deserved.  In the little annoyances of daily
   life, we are watchful not to excuse the hasty temper, the sharp word,
   the quick judgment, with the thought that we mean no harm, that we do
   not keep the anger long, or that it would be too much to expect from
   feeble human nature, that we should really forgive the way God and
   Christ do.  No, we take the command literally, Even as Christ forgave,
   so also do ye.'  The blood that cleanses the conscience from dead
   works, cleanses from selfishness too; the love it reveals is pardoning
   love, that takes possession of us and flows through us to others.  Our
   forgiving love to men is the evidence of the reality of God's forgiving
   love in us, and so the condition of the prayer of faith.

   There is a second, more general lesson:  our daily life in the world is
   made the test of our intercourse with God in prayer.  How often the
   Christian, when he comes to pray, does his utmost to cultivate certain
   frames of mind which he thinks will be pleasing.  He does not
   understand, or forgets, that life does not consist of so many loose
   pieces, of which now the one, then the other, can be taken up.  Life is
   a whole, and the pious frame of the hour of prayer is judged of by God
   from the ordinary frame of the daily life of which the hour of prayer
   is but a small part.  Not the feeling I call up, but the tone of my
   life during the day, is God's criterion of what I really am and
   desire.  My drawing nigh to God is of one piece with my intercourse
   with men and earth:  failure here will cause failure there.  And that
   not only when there is the distinct consciousness of anything wrong
   between my neighbour and myself; but the ordinary current of my
   thinking and judging, the unloving thoughts and words I allow to pass
   unnoticed, can hinder my prayer.  The effectual prayer of faith comes
   out from a life given up to the will and the love of God.  Not
   according to what I try to be when praying, but what I am when not
   praying, is my prayer dealt with by God.

   We may gather these thoughts into a third lesson:  In our life with men
   the one thing on which everything depends is love.  The spirit of
   forgiveness is the spirit of love.  Because God is love, He forgives:
   it is only when we are dwelling in love that we can forgive as God
   forgives.   In love to the brethren we have the evidence of love to the
   Father, the ground of confidence before God, and the assurance that our
   prayer will be heard, (1 John iv. 20, iii. 18-21, 23.).  Let us love in
   deed and truth; hereby shall we assure our heart before Him.  If our
   heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God, and whatever we ask,
   we receive of Him.'  Neither faith nor work will profit if we have not
   love; it is love that unites with God, it is love that proves the
   reality of faith.  As essential as in the word that precedes the great
   prayer-promise in Mark xi. 24, Have faith in God,' is this one that
   follows it, Have love to men.'  The right relations to the living God
   above me, and the living men around me, are the conditions of effectual
   prayer.

   This love is of special consequence when we labour for such and pray
   for them.  We sometimes give ourselves to work for Christ, from zeal
   for His cause, as we call it, or for our own spiritual health, without
   giving ourselves in personal self-sacrificing love for those whose
   souls we seek.  No wonder that our faith is feeble and does not
   conquer.  To look on each wretched one, however unloveable he be, in
   the light of the tender love of Jesus the Shepherd seeking the lost; to
   see Jesus Christ in him, and to take him up, for Jesus' sake, in a
   heart that really loves, --this, this is the secret of believing prayer
   and successful effort.  Jesus, in speaking of forgiveness, speaks of
   love as its root.  Just as in the Sermon on the Mount He connected His
   teaching and promises about prayer with the call to be merciful, as the
   Father in heaven is merciful (Matt. v. 7, 9, 22, 38-48), so we see it
   here:  a loving life is the condition of believing prayer.

   It has been said:  There is nothing so heart-searching as believing
   prayer, or even the honest effort to pray in faith.  O let us not turn
   the edge of that self-examination by the thought that God does not hear
   our prayer for reasons known to Himself alone.  By no means.  Ye ask
   and receive not, because ye ask amiss.'  Let that word of God search
   us.  Let us ask whether our prayer be indeed the expression of a life
   wholly given over to the will of God and the love of man.  Love is the
   only soil in which faith can strike its roots and thrive.  As it throws
   its arms up, and opens its heart heavenward, the Father always looks to
   see if it has them opened towards the evil and the unworthy too.  In
   that love, not indeed the love of perfect attainment, but the love of
   fixed purpose and sincere obedience, faith can alone obtain the
   blessing.  It is he who gives himself to let the love of God dwell in
   him, and in the practice of daily life to love as God loves, who will
   have the power to believe in the Love that hears his every prayer.  It
   is the Lamb, who is in the midst of the throne:  it is suffering and
   forbearing love that prevails with God in prayer.  The merciful shall
   obtain mercy; the meek shall inherit the earth.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Father!  Thou art Love, and only he that abideth in love
   abideth in Thee and in fellowship with Thee.  The Blessed Son hath this
   day again taught me how deeply true this is of my fellowship with Thee
   in prayer.  O my God! let Thy love, shed abroad in my heart by the Holy
   Spirit, be in me a fountain of love to all around me, that out of a
   life in love may spring the power of believing prayer.  O my Father!
   grant by the Holy Spirit that this may be my experience, that a life in
   love to all around me is the gate to a life in the love of my God.  And
   give me especially to find in the joy with which I forgive day by day
   whoever might offend me, the proof that Thy forgiveness to me is a
   power and a life.

   Lord Jesus! my Blessed Teacher! teach Thou me to forgive and to love.
   Let the power of Thy blood make the pardon of my sins such a reality,
   that forgiveness, as shown by Thee to me, and by me to others, may be
   the very joy of heaven.  Show me whatever in my intercourse with
   fellowmen might hinder my fellowship with God, so that my daily life in
   my own home and in society may be the school in which strength and
   confidence are gathered for the prayer of faith.   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

FIFTEENTH LESSON.

  If two agree;'

  Or,    The Power of United Prayer

   Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as
   touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my
   Father which is in heaven.  For where two or three are gathered
   together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.--Matt. xviii. 19,
   20.

   ONE of the first lessons of our Lord in His school of prayer was:  Not
   to be seen of men.  Enter thy inner chamber; be alone with the Father.
   When He has thus taught us that the meaning of prayer is personal
   individual contact with God, He comes  with a second lesson:  You have
   need not only of secret solitary, but also of public united prayer.
   And He gives us a very special promise for the united prayer of two or
   three who agree in what they ask.  As a tree has its root hidden in the
   ground and its stem growing up into the sunlight, so prayer needs
   equally for its full development the hidden secrecy in which the soul
   meets God alone, and the public fellowship with those who find in the
   name of Jesus their common meeting-place.

   The reason why this must be so is plain.  The bond that unites a man to
   his fellow-men is no less real and close than that which unites him to
   God:  he is one with them.  Grace renews not alone our relation to God
   but to man too.  We not only learn to say My Father,' but Our Father.'
   Nothing would be more unnatural than that the children of a family
   should always meet their father separately, but never in the united
   expression of their desires or their love.  Believers are not only
   members of one family, but even of one body.  Just as each member of
   the body depends on the other, and the full action of the spirit
   dwelling in the body depends on the union and co-operation of all, so
   Christians cannot reach the full blessing God is ready to bestow
   through His Spirit, but as they seek and receive it in fellowship with
   each other.  It is in the union and fellowship of believers that the
   Spirit can manifest His full power.  It was to the hundred and twenty
   continuing in one place together, and praying with one accord, that the
   Spirit came from the throne of the glorified Lord.

   The marks of true united prayer are given us in these words of our
   Lord.  The first is agreement as to the thing asked.  There must not
   only be generally the consent to agree with anything another may ask:
   there must be some special thing, matter of distinct united desire; the
   agreement must be, as all prayer, in spirit and in truth.  In such
   agreement it will become very clear to us what exactly we are asking,
   whether we may confidently ask according to God's will, and whether we
   are ready to believe that we have received what we ask.

   The second mark is the gathering in, or into, the Name of Jesus.  We
   shall afterwards have much more to learn of the need and the power of
   the Name of Jesus in prayer; here our Lord teaches us that the Name
   must be the centre of union to which believers gather, the bond of
   union that makes them one, just as a home contains and unites all who
   are in it.  The Name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous
   runneth into it and escape.'  That Name is such a reality to those who
   understand and believe it, that to meet within it is to have Himself
   present.  The love and unity of His disciples have to Jesus infinite
   attraction:  Where two or three are gathered in my Name, there am I in
   the midst of them.'  It is the living presence of Jesus, in the
   fellowship of His loving praying disciples, that gives united prayer
   its power.

   The third mark is, the sure answer:  It shall be done for them of my
   Father.'  A prayer-meeting for maintaining religious fellowship, or
   seeking our own edification, may have its use; this was not the
   Saviour's view in its appointment.  He meant it as a means of securing
   special answer to prayer.  A prayer meeting without recognised answer
   to prayer ought to be an anomaly.  When any of us have distinct desires
   in regard to which we feel too weak to exercise the needful faith, we
   ought to seek strength in the help of other.  In the unity of faith and
   of love and of the Spirit, the power of the Name and the Presence of
   Jesus acts more freely and the answer comes more surely.  The mark that
   there has been true united prayer is the fruit, the answer, the
   receiving of the thing we have asked:  I say unto you, It shall be done
   for them of my Father which is in heaven.'

   What an unspeakable privilege this of united prayer is, and what a
   power it might be.  If the believing husband and wife knew that they
   were joined together in the Name of Jesus to experience His presence
   and power in united prayer (1 Peter); if friends believed what mighty
   help two or three praying in concert could give each other; if in every
   prayer meeting the coming together in the Name, the faith in the
   Presence, and the expectation of the answer, stood in the foreground;
   if in every Church united effectual prayer were regarded as one of the
   chief purposes for which they are banded together, the highest exercise
   of their power as a Church; if in the Church universal the coming of
   the kingdom, the coming of the King Himself, first in the mighty
   outpouring of His Holy Spirit, then in His own glorious person, were
   really matter of unceasing united crying to God;--O who can say what
   blessing might come to, and through, those who thus agreed to prove God
   in the fulfilment of His promise.

   In the Apostle Paul we see very distinctly what a reality his faith in
   the power of united prayer was.  To the Romans he writes (xv. 30):  I
   beseech you, brethren, by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive
   together with me in your prayer to God for me.'  He expects in answer
   to be delivered from his enemies, and to be prospered in his work.  To
   the Corinthians (2 Cor. i. 11), God will still deliver us, ye also
   helping together on our behalf by your supplications;' their prayer is
   to have a real share in his deliverance.  To the Ephesians he writes:
   With all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit
   for all the saints and on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto
   me.'  His power and success in his ministry he makes to depend on their
   prayers.  With the Philippians (i. 19) he expects that his trials will
   turn to his salvation and the progress of the gospel through your
   supplications and  the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ.;  To the
   Colossians (iv. 3) he adds to the injunction to continue stedfast in
   prayer:  Withal praying for us too, that God may open unto us a door
   for the word.'  And to the Thessalonians (2 Thess. iii. 1) he writes:
   Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and
   be glorified, and that we may be delivered from unreasonable men.'  It
   is everywhere evident that Paul felt himself the member of a body, on
   the sympathy and co-operation of which he was dependent, and that he
   counted on the prayers of these Churches to gain for him, what
   otherwise might not be given.  The prayers of the Church were to him as
   real a factor in the work of the kingdom, as the power of God.

   Who can say what power a Church could develop and exercise, if it gave
   itself to the work of prayer day and night for the coming of the
   kingdom, for God's power on His servants and His word, for the
   glorifying of God in the salvation of souls?  Most Churches think their
   members are gathered into one simply to take care of and build up each
   other.  They know not that God rules the world by the prayers of His
   saints; that prayer is the power by which Satan is conquered; that by
   prayer the Church on earth has disposal of the powers of the heavenly
   world.  They do not remember that Jesus has, by His promise,
   consecrated every assembly in His Name to be a gate of heaven, where
   His Presence is to be felt, and His Power experienced in the Father
   fulfilling their desires.

   We cannot sufficiently thank God for the blessed week of united prayer,
   with which Christendom in our days opens every year.  As proof of our
   unity and our faith in the power of united prayer, as a training-school
   for the enlargement of our hearts to take in all the needs of the
   Church universal, as a help to united persevering prayer, it is of
   unspeakable value.  But very specially as a stimulus to continued union
   in prayer in the smaller circles, its blessing has been great.  And it
   will become even greater, as God's people recognise what it is, all to
   meet as one in the Name of Jesus to have His presence in the midst of a
   body all united in the Holy Spirit, and boldly to claim the promise
   that it shall be done of the Father what they agree to ask.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord! who didst in Thy high-priestly prayer ask so earnestly
   for the unity of Thy people, teach us how Thou dost invite and urge us
   to this unity by Thy precious promise given to united prayer.  It is
   when we are one in love and desire that our faith has Thy presence and
   the Father's answer.

   O Father! we pray for Thy people, and for every smaller circle of those
   who meet together, that they may be one.  Remove, we pray, all
   selfishness and self-interest, all narrowness of heart and
   estrangement, by which that unity is hindered.  Cast out the spirit of
   the world and the flesh, through which Thy promise loses all its
   power.  O let the thought of Thy presence and the Father's favour draw
   us all nearer to each other.

   Grant especially Blessed Lord, that Thy Church may believe that it is
   by the power of united prayer that she can bind and loose in heaven;
   that Satan can be cast out; that souls can be saved; that mountains can
   be removed; that the kingdom can be hastened.  And grant, good Lord!
   that in the circle with which I pray, the prayer of the Church may
   indeed be the power through which Thy Name and Word are glorified.
   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

SIXTEENTH LESSON.

  Speedily, though bearing long;'

  Or,    The Power of Persevering Prayer.

   And He spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to
   pray, and not to faint. . . . And the Lord said, Hear what the
   unrighteous judge saith.  And shall not God avenge His own elect, which
   cry to Him day and night, and He is long-suffering over them?  I say
   unto you, that He will avenge them speedily.'--Luke xviii. 1-8.

   OF all the mysteries of the prayer world, the need of persevering
   prayer is one of the greatest.  That the Lord, who is so loving and
   longing to bless, should have to be supplicated time after time,
   sometimes year after year, before the answer comes, we cannot easily
   understand.  It is also one of the greatest practical difficulties in
   the exercise of believing prayer.  When, after persevering
   supplication, our prayer remains unanswered, it is often easiest for
   our slothful flesh, and it has all the appearance of pious submission,
   to think that we must now cease praying, because God may have His
   secret reason for withholding His answer to our request.

   It is by faith alone that the difficulty is overcome.  When once faith
   has taken its stand upon God's word, and the Name of Jesus, and has
   yielded itself to the leading of the Spirit to seek God's will and
   honour alone in its prayer, it need not be discouraged by delay.  It
   knows from Scripture that the power of believing prayer is simply
   irresistible; real faith can never be disappointed.  It knows how, just
   as water, to exercise the irresistible power it can have, must be
   gathered up and accumulated, until the stream can come down in full
   force, there must often be a heaping up of prayer, until God sees that
   the measure is full, and the answer comes.  It knows how, just as the
   ploughman has to take his ten thousand steps, and sow his ten thousand
   seeds, each one a part of the preparation for the final harvest, so
   there is a need-be for oft-repeated persevering prayer, all working out
   some desired blessing.  It knows for certain that not a single
   believing prayer can fail of its effect in heaven, but has its
   influence, and is treasured up to work out an answer in due time to him
   who persevereth to the end.  It knows that it has to do not with human
   thoughts or possibilities, but with the word of the living God.  And so
   even as Abraham through so many years in hope believed against hope,'
   and then through faith and patience inherited the promise,' it counts
   that the long-suffering of the Lord is salvation, waiting and hasting
   unto the coming of its Lord to fulfil His promise.

   To enable us, when the answer to our prayer does not come at once, to
   combine quiet patience and joyful confidence in our persevering prayer,
   we must specially try to understand the two words in which our Lord
   sets forth the character and conduct, not of the unjust judge, but of
   our God and Father towards those whom He allows to cry day and night to
   Him:  He is long-suffering over them; He will avenge them speedily.'

   He will avenge them speedily, the Master says.  The blessing is all
   prepared; He is not only willing but most anxious to give them what
   they ask; everlasting love burns with the longing desire to reveal
   itself fully to its beloved, and to satisfy their needs.  God will not
   delay one moment longer than is absolutely necessary; He will do all in
   His power to hasten and speed the answer.

   But why, if this be true and His power be infinite, does it often last
   so long with the answer to prayer?  And why must God's own elect so
   often, in the midst of suffering and conflict, cry day and night?  He
   is  long-suffering over them.'  Behold! the husbandman waiteth for the
   precious fruit of the earth, being long-suffering over it, till it
   receive the early and the latter rain.'  The husbandman does indeed
   long for his harvest, but knows that it must have its full time of
   sunshine and rain, and has long patience.  A child so often wants to
   pick the half-ripe fruit; the husbandman knows to wait till the proper
   time.  Man, in his spiritual nature too, is under the law of gradual
   growth that reigns in all created life.  It is only in the path of
   development that he can reach his divine destiny.  And it is the
   Father, in whose hands are the times and seasons, who alone knows the
   moment when the soul or the Church is ripened to that fulness of faith
   in which it can really take and keep the blessing.  As a father who
   longs to have his only child home from school, and yet waits patiently
   till the time of training is completed, so it is with God and His
   children:  He is the long-suffering One, and answers speedily.

   The insight into this truth leads the believer to cultivate the
   corresponding dispositions:  patience and faith, waiting and hasting,
   are the secret of his perseverance.  By faith in the promise of God, we
   know that we have the petitions we have asked of Him.  Faith takes and
   holds the answer in the promise, as an unseen spiritual possession,
   rejoices in it, and praises for it.  But there is a difference between
   the faith that thus holds the word and knows that it has the answer,
   and the clearer, fuller, riper faith that obtains the promise as a
   present experience.  It is in persevering, not unbelieving, but
   confident and praising prayer, that the soul grows up into that full
   union with its Lord in which it can enter upon the possession of the
   blessing in Him.  There may be in these around us, there may be in that
   great system of being of which we are part, there may be in God's
   government, things that have to be put right through our prayer, ere
   the answer can fully come:  the faith that has, according to the
   command, believed that it has received, can allow God to take His
   time:  it knows it has prevailed and must prevail.  In quiet,
   persistent, and determined perseverance it continues in prayer and
   thanksgiving until the blessing come.  And so we see combined what at
   first sight appears so contradictory; the faith that rejoices in the
   answer of the unseen God as a present possession, with the patience
   that cries day and night until it be revealed.  The speedily of God's
   long-suffering is met by the triumphant but patient faith of His
   waiting child.

   Our great danger in this school of the answer delayed, is the
   temptation to think that, after all, it may not be God's will to give
   us what we ask.  If our prayer be according to God's word, and under
   the leading of the Spirit, let us not give way to these fears.  Let us
   learn to give God time.  God needs time with us.  If we only give Him
   time, that is, time in the daily fellowship with Himself, for Him to
   exercise the full influence of His presence on us, and time, day by
   day, in the course of our being kept waiting, for faith to prove its
   reality and to fill our whole being, He Himself will lead us from faith
   to vision; we shall see the glory of God.  Let no delay shake our
   faith.  Of faith it holds good:  first the blade, then the ear, then
   the full corn in the ear.  Each believing prayer brings a step nearer
   the final victory.  Each believing prayer helps to ripen the fruit and
   bring us nearer to it; it fills up the measure of prayer and faith
   known to God alone; it conquers the hindrances in the unseen world; it
   hastens the end.  Child of God! give the Father time.  He is
   long-suffering over you.  He wants the blessing to be rich, and full,
   and sure; give Him time, while you cry day and night.  Only remember
   the word:  I say unto you, He will avenge them speedily.'

   The blessing of such persevering prayer is unspeakable.  There is
   nothing so heart-searching as the prayer of faith.  It teaches you to
   discover and confess, and give up everything that hinders the coming of
   the blessing; everything there may be not in accordance with the
   Father's will.  It leads to closer fellowship with Him who alone can
   teach to pray, to a more entire surrender to draw nigh under no
   covering but that of the blood, and the Spirit.  It calls to a closer
   and more simple abiding in Christ alone.  Christian! give God time.  He
   will perfect that which concerneth you.  Long-suffering--speedily,'
   this is God's watchword as you enter the gates of prayer:  be it yours
   too.

   Let it be thus whether you pray for yourself, or for others.  All
   labour, bodily or mental, needs time and effort:  we must give up
   ourselves to it.  Nature discovers her secrets and yields her treasures
   only to diligent and thoughtful labour.  However little we can
   understand it, in the spiritual husbandry it is the same:  the seed we
   sow in the soil of heaven, the efforts we put forth, and the influence
   we seek to exert in the world above, need our whole being:  we must
   give ourselves to prayer.  But let us hold fast the great confidence,
   that in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

   And let us specially learn the lesson as we pray for the Church of
   Christ.  She is indeed as the poor widow, in the absence of her Lord,
   apparently at the mercy of her adversary, helpless to obtain redress.
   Let us, when we pray for His Church or any portion of it, under the
   power of the world, asking Him to visit her with the mighty workings of
   His Spirit and to prepare her for His coming, let us pray in the
   assured faith:  prayer does help, praying always and not fainting will
   bring the answer.  Only give God time.  And then keep crying day and
   night.  Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.  And shall not God
   avenge His own elect, which cry to Him day and night, and He is
   long-suffering over them.  I say unto you, He will avenge them
   speedily.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O Lord my God!  teach me now to know Thy way, and in faith to apprehend
   what Thy Beloved Son has taught:  He will avenge them speedily.'  Let
   Thy tender love, and the delight Thou hast in hearing and blessing Thy
   children, lead me implicitly to accept Thy promise, that we receive
   what we believe, that we have the petitions we ask, and that the answer
   will in due time be seen.  Lord! we understand the seasons in nature,
   and know to wait with patience for the fruit we long for--O fill us
   with the assurance that not one moment longer than is needed wilt Thou
   delay, and that faith will hasten the answer.

   Blessed Master! Thou hast said that it is a sign of God's elect that
   they cry day and night.  O teach us to understand this.  Thou knowest
   how speedily we grow faint and weary.  It is as if the Divine Majesty
   is so much beyond the need or the reach of continued supplication, that
   it does not become us to be too importunate.  O Lord! do teach me how
   real the labour of prayer is.  I know how here on earth, when I have
   failed in an undertaking, I can often succeed by renewed and more
   continuing effort, by giving more time and thought:  show me how, by
   giving myself more entirely to prayer, to live in prayer, I shall
   obtain what I ask.  And above all, O my blessed Teacher! Author and
   perfecter of faith, let by Thy grace my whole life be one of faith in
   the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me--in whom my prayer
   gains acceptance, in whom I have the assurance of the answer, in whom
   the answer will be mine.  Lord Jesus! in this faith I will pray always
   and not faint.  Amen.

   NOTE

   The need of persevering importunate prayer appears to some to be at
   variance with the faith which knows that it has received what it asks
   (Mark xi. 24).  One of the mysteries of the Divine life is the harmony
   between the gradual and the sudden, immediate full possession, and slow
   imperfect appropriation.  And so here persevering prayer appears to be
   the school in which the soul is strengthened for the boldness of
   faith.  And with the diversity of operations of the Spirit there may be
   some in whom faith takes more the form of persistent waiting; while to
   others, triumphant thanksgiving appears the only proper expressions of
   the assurance of having been heard.

   In a remarkable way the need of persevering prayer, and the gradual
   rising into greater ease in obtaining answer, is illustrated in the
   life of Blumhardt.  Complaints had been lodged against him of
   neglecting his work as a minister of the gospel, and devoting himself
   to the healing of the sick; and especially his unauthorized healing of
   the sick belonging to other congregations.  In his defense he writes:
   I simply ventured to do what becomes one who has the charge of souls,
   and to pray according to the command of the Lord in James i. 6, 7.  In
   no way did I trust to my own power, or imagine that I had any gift that
   others had not.  But this is true, I set myself to the work as a
   minister of the gospel, who has a right to pray.  But I speedily
   discovered that the gates of heaven were not fully opened to me.  Often
   I was inclined to retire in despair.  But the sight of the sick ones,
   who could find help nowhere, gave me no rest.  I thought of the word of
   the Lord:  "Ask, and it shall be given you" (Luke xi. 9, 10).  And
   farther, I thought that if the Church and her ministers had, through
   unbelief, sloth, and disobedience lost what was needed for overcoming
   of the power of Satan, it was just for such times of leanness and
   famine that the Lord had spoken the parable of the friend at midnight
   and his three loaves.  I felt that I was not worthy thus at midnight,
   in a time of great darkness, to appear before God as His friend and ask
   for a member of my congregation what he needed.  And yet, to leave him
   uncared for, I could not either.  And so I kept knocking, as the
   parable directs, or, as some have said, with great presumption and
   tempting God.  Be this as it may, I could not leave my guest
   unprovided.  At this time the parable of the widow became very precious
   to me.  I saw that the Church was the widow, and I was a minister of
   the Church.  I had the right to be her mouthpiece against the
   adversary; but for a long time the Lord would not.  I asked nothing
   more than the three loaves; what I needed for my guest.  At last the
   Lord listened to the importunate beggar, and helped me.  Was it wrong
   of me to pray thus?  The two parables must surely be applicable
   somewhere, and where was greater need to be conceived?

   And what was the fruit of my prayer?  The friend who was at first
   unwilling, did not say, Go now; I will myself give to your friend what
   he needs; I do not require you; but gave it to me as His friend, to
   give to my guest.  And so I used the three loaves, and had to spare.
   But the supply was small, and new guests came; because they saw I had a
   heart to help them, and that I would take the trouble even at midnight
   to go to my friend.  When I asked for them, too, I got the needful
   again, and there was again to spare.  How could I help that the needy
   continually came to my house?  Was I to harden myself, and say, Why do
   you come to me?  there are large and better homes in the city, go
   there.  Their answer was, Dear sir, we cannot go there.  We have been
   there:  they were very sorry to send us away so hungry, but they could
   not undertake to go and ask a friend for what we wanted.  Do go, and
   get us bread for we suffer great pain.  What could I do?  They spoke
   the truth, and their suffering touched my heart.  However much labour
   it cost me, I went each time again, and got the three loaves.  Often I
   got what I asked much quicker than at first, and also much more
   abundantly.  But all did not care for this bread, so some left my home
   hungry.'^1

   In his first struggles with the evil spirits, it took him more than
   eighteen months of prayer and labour before the final victory was
   gained.  Afterwards he had such ease of access to the throne, and stood
   in such close communication with the unseen world, that often, with
   letters came asking prayer for sick people, he could, after just
   looking upward for a single moment, obtain the answer as to whether
   they would be healed.

SEVENTEENTH LESSON.

  I know that Thou hearest me always;'

  Or          Prayer in Harmony with the Being of God.

   Father, I thank Thee that Thou heardest me.  And I knew that Thou
   hearest me always.'--John xi. 41, 42.

   Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee.  Ask of me, and I shall
   give Thee.'--Ps. ii. 7, 8.

   IN the New Testament we find a distinction made between faith and
   knowledge.  To one is given, through the Spirit, the word of  wisdom;
   to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; to
   another faith, in the same Spirit.'  In a child or a simple-minded
   Christian there may be much faith with little knowledge.  Childlike
   simplicity accepts the truth without difficulty, and often cares little
   to give itself or others any reason for its faith but this:  God has
   said.  But it is the will of God that we should love and serve Him, not
   only with all the heart but also with all the mind; that we should grow
   up into an insight into the Divine wisdom and beauty of all His ways
   and words and works.  It is only thus that the believer will be able
   fully to approach and rightly to adore the glory of God's grace; and
   only thus that our heart can intelligently apprehend the treasures of
   wisdom and knowledge there are in redemption, and be prepared to enter
   fully into the highest note of the song that rises before the throne:
   O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!'

   In our prayer life this truth has its full application.  While prayer
   and faith are so simple that the new-born convert can pray with power,
   true Christian science finds in the doctrine of prayer some of its
   deepest problems.  In how far is the power of prayer a reality?  If so,
   how God can grant to prayer such mighty power?  How can the action of
   prayer be harmonized with the will and the decrees of God?  How can
   God's sovereignty and our will, God's liberty and ours, be
   reconciled?--these and other like questions are fit subjects for
   Christian meditation and inquiry.  The more earnestly and reverently we
   approach such mysteries, the more shall we in adoring wonder fall down
   to praise Him who hath in prayer given such power to man.

   One of the secret difficulties with regard to prayer,--one which,
   though not expressed, does often really hinder prayer,--is derived from
   the perfection of God, in His absolute independence of all that is
   outside of Himself.  Is He not the Infinite Being, who owes what He is
   to Himself alone, who determines Himself, and whose wise and holy will
   has determined all that is to be?  How can prayer influence Him, or He
   be moved by prayer to do what otherwise would not be done?  Is not the
   promise of an answer to prayer simply a condescension to our weakness?
   Is what is said of the power--the much-availing power--of prayer
   anything more than an accommodation to our mode of thought, because the
   Deity never can be dependent on any action from without for its
   doings?  And is not the blessing of prayer simply the influence it
   exercises upon ourselves?

   In seeking an answer to such questions, we find the key in the very
   being of God, in the mystery of the Holy Trinity.  If God was only one
   Person, shut up within Himself, there could be no thought of nearness
   to Him or influence on Him.  But in God there are three Persons.  In
   God we have Father and Son, who have in the Holy Spirit their living
   bond of unity and fellowship.  When eternal Love begat the Son, and the
   Father gave the Son as the Second Person a place next Himself as His
   Equal and His Counsellor, there was a way opened for prayer and its
   influence in the very inmost life of Deity itself.  Just as on earth,
   so in heaven the whole relation between Father and Son is that of
   giving and taking.  And if that taking is to be as voluntary and
   self-determined as the giving, there must be on the part of the Son an
   asking and receiving.  In the holy fellowship of the Divine Persons,
   this asking of the Son was one of the great operations of the Thrice
   Blessed Life of God.  Hence we have it in Psalm ii.:  This day I have
   begotten Thee:  ask of me and I will give Thee.'  The Father gave the
   Son the place and the power to act upon Him.  The asking of the Son was
   no mere show or shadow, but one of those life-movements in which the
   love of the Father and the Son met and completed each other.  The
   Father had determined that He should not be alone in His counsels:
   there was a Son on whose asking and accepting their fulfilment should
   depend.  And so there was in the very Being and Life of God an asking
   of which prayer on earth was to be the reflection and the outflow.  It
   was not without including this that Jesus said, "I knew that Thou
   always hearest me.'  Just as the Sonship of Jesus on earth may not be
   separated from His Sonship in heaven, even so with His prayer on earth,
   it is the continuation and the counterpart of His asking in heaven.
   The prayer of the man Christ Jesus is the link between the eternal
   asking of the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father and the
   prayer of men upon earth.  Prayer has its rise and its deepest source
   in the very Being of God.  In the bosom of Deity nothing is ever done
   without prayer--the asking of the Son and the giving of the Father.^1

   This may help us somewhat to understand how the prayer of man, coming
   through the Son, can have effect upon God.  The decrees of God are not
   decisions made by Him without reference to the Son, or His petition, or
   the petition to be sent up through Him.  By no means.  The Lord Jesus
   is the first-begotten, the Head and Heir of all things:  all things
   were created through Him and unto Him, and all things consist in Him.
   In the counsels of the Father, the Son, as Representative of all
   creation, had always a voice; in the decrees of the eternal purpose
   there was always room left for the liberty of the Son as Mediator and
   Intercessor, and so for the petitions of all who draw nigh to the
   Father in the Son.

   And if the thought come that this liberty and power of the Son to act
   upon the Father is at variance with the immutability of the Divine
   decrees, let us not forget that there is not with God as with man, a
   past by which He is irrevocably bound.  God does not live in time with
   its past and future; the distinctions of time have no reference to Him
   who inhabits Eternity.  And Eternity is an ever-present Now, in which
   the past is never past, and the future always present.  To meet our
   human weakness, Scripture must speak of past decrees, and a coming
   future.  In reality, the immutability of God's counsel is ever still in
   perfect harmony with His liberty to do whatsoever He will.  Not so were
   the prayers of the Son and His people taken up into the eternal decrees
   that their effect should only be an apparent one; but so, that the
   Father-heart holds itself open and free to listen to every prayer that
   rises through the Son, and that God does indeed allow Himself to be
   decided by prayer to do what He otherwise would not have done.

   This perfect harmony and union of Divine Sovereignty and human liberty
   is to us an unfathomable mystery, because God as THE ETERNAL ONE
   transcends all our thoughts.  But let it be our comfort and strength to
   be assured that in the eternal fellowship of the Father and the Son,
   the power of prayer has its origin and certainty, and that through our
   union with the Son, our prayer is taken up and can have its influence
   in the inner life of the Blessed Trinity.  God's decrees are no iron
   framework against which man's liberty would vainly seek to struggle.
   No.  God Himself is the Living Love, who in His Son as man has entered
   into the tenderest relation with all that is human, who through the
   Holy Spirit takes up all that is human into the Divine life of love,
   and keeps Himself free to give every human prayer its place in His
   government of the world.

   It is in the daybreak light of such thoughts that the doctrine of the
   Blessed Trinity no longer is an abstract speculation, but the living
   manifestation of the way in which it were possible for man to be taken
   up into the fellowship of God, and his prayer to become a real factor
   in God's rule of this earth.  And we can, as in the distance, catch
   glimpses of the light that from the eternal world shines out on words
   such as these:  THROUGH HIM we have access BY ONE SPIRIT unto THE
   FATHER.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Everlasting God!  the Three-One and Thrice Holy!  in deep reverence
   would I with veiled face worship before the holy mystery of Thy Divine
   Being.  And if it please Thee, O most glorious God, to unveil aught of
   that mystery, I would bow with fear and trembling, lest I sin against
   Thee, as I meditate on Thy glory.

   Father!  I thank Thee that Thou bearest this name not only as the
   Father of Thy children here on earth, but as having from eternity
   subsisted as the Father with Thine only-begotten Son.  I thank Thee
   that as Father Thou canst hear our prayer, because Thou hast from
   eternity given a place in Thy counsels to the asking of Thy Son.  I
   thank Thee that we have seen in Him on earth, what the blessed
   intercourse was He had with Thee in heaven; and how from eternity in
   all Thy counsels and decrees there had been room left for His prayer
   and their answers.  And I thank Thee above all that through His true
   human nature on Thy throne above, and through Thy Holy Spirit in our
   human nature here below, a way has been opened up by which every human
   cry of need can be taken up into and touch the Life and the Love of
   God, and receive in answer whatsoever it shall ask.

   Blessed Jesus!  in whom as the Son the path of prayer has been opened
   up, and who givest us assurance of the answer, we beseech Thee, teach
   Thy people to pray.  O let this each day be the sign of our sonship,
   that, like Thee, we know that the Father heareth us always.  Amen.

   NOTE.

   "God hears prayer."  This simplest view of prayer is taken throughout
   Scripture.  It dwells not on the reflex influence of prayer on our
   heart and life, although it abundantly shows the connection between
   prayer as an act, and prayer as a state.  It rather fixes with great
   definiteness the objective or real purposes of prayer, to obtain
   blessing, gifts, deliverances from God.  Ask and it shall be given,"
   Jesus says.

   However true and valuable the reflection may be, that God, foreseeing
   and foreordaining all things, has also foreseen and foreordained our
   prayers as links in the chain of events, of cause and effect, as a real
   power, yet we feel convinced that this is not the light in which the
   mind can find peace in this great subject, nor do we think that here is
   the attractive power to draw us in prayer.  We feel rather that such a
   reflection diverts the attention from the Object whence comes the
   impulse, life, and strength of prayer.  The living God, cotemporary and
   not merely eternal,^1 the living, merciful, holy One, God manifesting
   Himself to the soul, God saying, "Seek my face;" this is the magnet
   that draws us, this alone can open heart and lips. . .

   In Jesus Christ the Son of God we have the full solution of the
   difficulty.  He prayed on earth, and that not merely as man, but as the
   Son of God incarnate.  His prayer on earth is only the manifestation of
   His prayer from all eternity, when in the Divine counsel He was set up
   as the Christ. . . . The Son was appointed to be heir of all things.
   From all eternity the Son of God was the Way, the Mediator.  He was, to
   use our imperfect language, from eternity speaking unto the Father on
   behalf of the world.'--SAPHIR, The Hidden Life, chap. vi.  See also The
   Lord's Prayer, p. 12.

   ^1Should it not rather be cotemporary, because eternal, in the proper
   meaning of this latter word?

EIGHTEENTH LESSON

  Whose is this image?'

  Or,          Prayer in Harmony with the Destiny of Man.

   He saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?--Matt. xxi.
   20.

   And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.'--Gen.
   i. 26.

   WHOSE is this image?'  It was by this question that Jesus foiled His
   enemies, when they thought to take Him, and settled the matter of duty
   in regard to the tribute.  The question and the principle it involves
   are of universal application.  Nowhere more truly than in man himself.
   The image he bears decides his destiny.  Bearing God's image, he
   belongs to God:  prayer to God is what he was created for.  Prayer is
   part of the wondrous likeness he bears to His Divine original; of the
   deep mystery of the fellowship of love in which the Three-One has His
   blessedness, prayer is the earthly image and likeness.

   The more we meditate on what prayer is, and the wonderful power with
   God which it has, the more we feel constrained to ask who and what man
   is, that such a place in God's counsels should have been allotted to
   him.  Sin has so degraded him, that from what he is now we can form no
   conception of what he was meant to be.  We must turn back to God's own
   record of man's creation to discover there what God's purpose was, and
   what the capacities with which man was endowed for the fulfilment of
   that purpose.

   Man's destiny appears clearly from God's language at creation.  It was
   to fill, to subdue, to have dominion over the earth and all in it.  All
   the three expressions show us that man was meant, as God's
   representative, to hold rule here on earth.  As God's viceroy he was to
   fill God's place:  himself subject to God, he was to keep all else in
   subjection to Him.  It was the will of God that all that was to be done
   on earth should be done through him:  the history of the earth was to
   be entirely in his hands.

   In accordance with such a destiny was the position he was to occupy,
   and the power at his disposal.  When an earthly sovereign sends a
   viceroy to a distant province, it is understood that he advises as to
   the policy to be adopted, and that that advice is acted on:  that he is
   at liberty to apply for troops and the other means needed for carrying
   out the policy or maintaining the dignity of the empire.  If his policy
   be not approved of, he is recalled to make way for some one who better
   understands his sovereign's desires' as long as he is trusted, his
   advice is carried out.  As God's representative man was to have ruled;
   all was to have been done under his will and rule; on his advice and at
   his request heaven was to have bestowed its blessing on earth.  His
   prayer was to have been the wonderful, though simple and most natural
   channel, in which the intercourse between the King in heaven and His
   faithful servant man, as lord of this world, was to have been
   maintained.  The destinies of the world were given into the power of
   the wishes, the will, the prayer of man.

   With sin all this underwent a terrible change--man's fall brought all
   creation under the curse.  With redemption the beginning was seen of a
   glorious restoration.  No sooner had God begun in Abraham to form for
   Himself a people from whom kings, yea the Great King, should come
   forth, than we see what power the prayer of God's faithful servant has
   to decide the destinies of those who come into contact with him.  In
   Abraham we see how prayer is not only, or even chiefly, the means of
   obtaining blessing for ourselves, but is the exercise of his royal
   prerogative to influence the destinies of men, and the will of God
   which rules them.  We do not once find Abraham praying for himself.
   His prayer for Sodom and Lot, for Abimelech, for Ishmael, prove what
   power a man, who is God's friend, has to make the history of those
   around him.

   This had been man's destiny from the first.  Scripture not only tells
   us this, but also teaches us how it was that God could entrust man with
   such a high calling.  It was because He had created him in His own
   image and likeness.  The external rule was not committed to him without
   the inner fitness:  the bearing God's image in having dominion, in
   being lord of all, had its root in the inner likeness, in his nature.
   There was an inner agreement and harmony between God and man, and
   incipient Godlikeness, which gave man a real fitness for being the
   mediator between God and His world, for he was to be prophet, priest,
   and king, to interpret God's will, to represent nature's needs, to
   receive and dispense God's bounty.  It was in bearing God's image that
   he could bear God's rule; he was indeed so like God, so capable of
   entering into God's purposes, and carrying out His plans, that God
   could trust him with the wonderful privilege of asking and obtaining
   what the world might need.  And although sin has for a time frustrated
   God's plans, prayer still remains what it would have been if man had
   never fallen:  the proof of man's Godlikeness, the vehicle of his
   intercourse with the Infinite Unseen One, the power that is allowed to
   hold the hand that holds the destinies of the universe.  Prayer is not
   merely the cry of the suppliant for mercy; it is the highest
   forth-putting of his will by man, knowing himself to be of Divine
   origin, created for and capable of being, in king-like liberty, the
   executor of the counsels of the Eternal.

   What sin destroyed, grace has restored.  What the first Adam lost, the
   second has won back.  In Christ man regains his original position, and
   the Church, abiding in Christ, inherits the promise:  Ask what ye will,
   and it shall be done unto you.'  Such a promise does by no means, in
   the first place, refer to the grace or blessing we need for ourselves.
   It has reference to our position as the fruit-bearing branches of the
   Heavenly Vine, who, like Him, only live for the work and glory of the
   Father.  It is for those who abide in Him, who have forsaken self to
   take up their abode in Him with His life of obedience and
   self-sacrifice, who have lost their life and found it in Him, who are
   now entirely given up to the interests of the Father and His kingdom.
   These are they who understand how their new creation has brought them
   back to their original destiny, has restored God's image and likeness,
   and with it the power to have dominion.  Such have indeed the power,
   each in their own circle, to obtain and dispense the powers of heaven
   here on earth.  With holy boldness they may make known what they will:
   they live as priests in God's presence; as kings the powers of the
   world to come begin to be at their disposal. [1]   They enter upon the
   fulfilment of the promise:  Ask whatsoever ye will, it shall be done
   unto you.'

   Church of the living God!  thy calling is higher and holier than thou
   knowest.  Through thy members, as kings, and priests unto God, would
   God rule the world; their prayers bestow and withhold the blessing of
   heaven.  In His elect who are not just content to be themselves saved,
   but yield themselves wholly, that through them, even as through the
   Son, the Father may fulfil all His glorious counsel, in these His
   elect, who cry day and night unto Him, God would prove how wonderful
   man's original destiny was.  As the image-bearer of God on earth, the
   earth was indeed given into his hand.  When he fell, all fell with
   him:  the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together.  But
   now he is redeemed; the restoration of the original dignity has begun.
   It is in very deed God's purpose that the fulfilment of His eternal
   purpose, and the coming of His kingdom, should depend on those of His
   people who, abiding in Christ, are ready to take up their position in
   Him their Head, the great Priest-King, and in their prayers are bold
   enough to say what they will that their God should do.  As image-bearer
   and representative of God on earth, redeemed man has by his prayers to
   determine the history of this earth.  Man was created, and has now
   again been redeemed, to pray, and by his prayer to have dominion.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Lord!  what is man, that Thou art mindful of him?  and the son of man,
   that Thou visitest him?  for Thou has made him a little lower than the
   angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.  Thou madest him to
   have dominion over the work of Thy hands:  Thou hast put all things
   under his feet.  O Lord our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the
   earth!

   Lord God!  how low has sin made man to sink.  And how terribly has it
   darkened his mind, that he does not even know his Divine destiny, to be
   Thy servant and representative.  Alas!  that even Thy people, when
   their eyes are opened, are so little ready to accept their calling and
   to seek to have power with God, that they may have power with men too
   to bless them.

   Lord Jesus!  it is in Thee the Father hath again crowned man with glory
   and honour, and opened the way for us to be what He would have us.  O
   Lord, have mercy on Thy people, and visit Thine heritage!  Work
   mightily in Thy Church, and teach Thy believing disciples to go forth
   in their royal priesthood, and in the power of prayer, to which Thou
   hast given such wonderful promises, to serve Thy kingdom, to have rule
   over the nations, and make the name of God glorious in the earth.
   Amen.

   [1] God is seeking priests among the sons of men.  A human priesthood
   is one of the essential parts of His eternal plan.  To rule creation by
   man is His design; to carry on the worship of creation by man is no
   less part of His design. Priesthood is the appointed link between
   heaven and earth, the channel of intercourse between the sinner and
   God.  Such a priesthood, in so far as expiation is concerned, is in the
   hands of the Son of God alone; in so far as it is to be the medium of
   communication between Creator and creature, is also in the hands of
   redeemed men--of the Church of God. God is seeking kings.  Not out of
   the ranks of angels.  Fallen man must furnish Him with the rulers of
   His universe.  Human hands must wield the sceptre, human heads must
   wear the crown.--The Rent Veil, by Dr. H. Bonar.

NINTEENTH LESSON.

  I go unto the Father!'

  Or,          Power for Praying and Working.

   Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that
   I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do;
   because I go unto my Father.  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my Name,
   that will I do.'--John xiv. 12, 13.

   AS the Saviour opened His public ministry with His disciples by the
   Sermon on the Mount, so He closes it by the Parting Address preserved
   to us by John.  In both He speaks more than once of prayer.  But with a
   difference.  In the Sermon on the Mount it is as to disciples who have
   only just entered His school, who scarcely know that God is their
   Father, and whose prayer chiefly has reference to their personal
   needs.  In His closing address He speaks to disciples whose training
   time is now come to an end, and who are ready as His messengers to take
   His place and His work.  In the former the chief lesson is:  Be
   childlike, pray believingly, and trust the Father that He will give you
   all good gifts.  Here He points to something higher:  They are now His
   friends to whom He has made known all that He has heard of the Father;
   His messengers, who have entered into His plans, and into whose hands
   the care of His work and kingdom on earth is to be entrusted.  They are
   now to go out and do His works, and in the power of His approaching
   exaltation, even greater works:  prayer is now to be the channel
   through which that power is to be received for their work.  With
   Christ's ascension to the Father a new epoch commences for their
   working and praying both.

   See how clearly this connection comes out in our text.  As His body
   here on earth, as those who are one with Him in heaven, they are now to
   do greater works than He had done; their success and their victories
   are to be greater than His.  He mentions two reasons for this.  The
   one, because He was to go to the Father, to receive all power; the
   other, because they might now ask and expect all in His Name.  Because
   I go to the Father, and--notice this and--and, whatsoever ye shall ask,
   I will do.'  His going to the Father would thus bring the double
   blessing:  they would ask and receive all in His Name, and as a
   consequence, would do the greater works.  This first mention of prayer
   in our Saviour's parting words thus teaches us two most important
   lessons.  He that would do the works of Jesus must pray in His Name.
   He that would pray in His Name must work in His Name.

   He who would work must pray:  it is in prayer that the power for work
   is obtained.  He that in faith would do the works that Jesus did, must
   pray in His Name.  As long as Jesus was here on earth, He Himself did
   the greatest works:  devils the disciples could not cast out, fled at
   His word.  When He went to the Father, He was no longer here in the
   body to work directly.  The disciples were now His body:  all His work
   from the throne in heaven here on earth must and could be done through
   them.  One might have thought that now He was leaving the scene
   Himself, and could only work through commissioners, the works might be
   fewer and weaker.  He assures us of the contrary:  Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do
   also, and he shall do greater works.'  His approaching death was to be
   such a real breaking down and making an end of the power of sin; with
   the resurrection the powers of the Eternal Life were so truly to take
   possession of the human body and to obtain supremacy over human life;
   with His ascension He was to receive the power to communicate the Holy
   Spirit so fully to His own; the union, the oneness between Himself on
   the throne and them on earth, was to be so intensely and divinely
   perfect, that He meant it as the literal truth:  Greater works than
   these shall he do, because I go to the Father.'  And the issue proved
   how true it was.  While Jesus, during three years of personal labour on
   earth, gathered little more than five hundred disciples, and the most
   of them so feeble that they were but little credit to His cause, it was
   given to men like Peter and Paul manifestly to do greater things than
   He had done.  From the throne He could do through them what He Himself
   in His humiliation could not yet do.

   But there is one condition:  He that believeth on me, he shall do
   greater works, because I go to the Father; and whatsover ye shall ask
   in my Name, that will I do.'  His going to the Father would give Him a
   new power to hear prayer.  For the doing of the greater works, two
   things were needed:  His going to the Father to receive all power, our
   prayer in His Name to receive all power from Him again.  As He asks the
   Father, He receives and bestows on us the power of the new dispensation
   for the greater works; as we believe, and ask in His Name, the power
   comes and takes possession of us to do the greater works.

   Alas!  how much working there is in the work of God, in which there is
   little or nothing to be seen of the power to do anything like Christ's
   works, not to speak of greater works.  There can be but one reason:
   the believing on Him, the believing prayer in His Name, this is so much
   wanting.  O that every labourer and leader in church, or school, in the
   work of home philanthropy or foreign missions might learn the lesson:
   Prayer in the Name of Jesus is the way to share in the mighty power
   which Jesus has received of the Father for His people, and it is in
   this power alone that he that believeth can do the greater works.  To
   every complaint as to weakness or unfitness, as to difficulties or want
   of success, Jesus gives this one answer:  He that believeth on me shall
   do greater works, because I go to the Father, and whatsoever ye shall
   ask in my Name, that will I do.'  We must understand that the first and
   chief thing for everyone who would do the work of Jesus, is to believe,
   and so to get linked to Him, the Almighty One, and then to pray the
   prayer of faith in His Name.  Without this our work is but human and
   carnal; it may have some use in restraining sin, or preparing the way
   for blessing, but the real power is wanting.  Effectual working needs
   first effectual prayer.

   And now the second lesson:  He who would pray must work.  It is for
   power to work that prayer has such great promises:  it is in working
   that the power for the effectual prayer of faith will be gained.  In
   these parting words of our blessed Lord we find that He no less than
   six times (John xiv. 13, 14, xv. 7, 16, xvi. 23, 24) repeats those
   unlimited prayer-promises which have so often awakened our anxious
   questionings as to their real meaning:  whatsoever,' anything,' what ye
   will,' ask and ye shall receive.'  How many a believer has read these
   over with joy and hope, and in deep earnestness of soul has sought to
   plead them for his own need.  And he has come out disappointed.  The
   simple reason was this:  he had rent away the promise from its
   surrounding.  The Lord gave the wonderful promise of the free use of
   His Name with the Father in connection with the doing of His works.  It
   is the disciple who gives himself wholly to live for Jesus' work and
   kingdom, for His will and honour, to whom the power will come to
   appropriate the promise.  He that would fain grasp the promise when he
   wants something very special for himself, will be disappointed, because
   he would make Jesus the servant of his own comfort.  But to him who
   seeks to pray the effectual prayer of faith, because he needs it for
   the work of the Master, to him it will be given to learn it; because he
   has made himself the servant of his Lord's interests.  Prayer not only
   teaches and strengthens to work:  work teaches and strengthens to pray.

   This is in perfect harmony with what holds good both in the natural and
   the spiritual world.  Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; or, He
   that is faithful in a little, is faithful also in much.  Let us with
   the small measure of grace already received, give ourselves to the
   Master for His work:  work will be to us a real school of prayer.  It
   was when Moses had to take full charge of a rebellious people that he
   felt the need, but also the courage, to speak boldly to God and to ask
   great things of Him (Ex. xxxiii. 12, 15, 18).  As you give yourself
   entirely to God for His work, you will feel that nothing less than
   these great promises are what you need, that nothing less is what you
   may most confidently expect.

   Believer in Jesus!  You are called, you are appointed, to do the works
   of Jesus, and even greater works, because He has gone to the Father to
   receive the power to do them in and through you.

   Whatsoever ye shall ask in my Name, that will I do.  Give yourself, and
   live, to do the works of Christ and you will learn to pray so as to
   obtain wonderful answers to prayer.  Give yourself, and live, to pray
   and you will learn to do the works He did, and greater works.  With
   disciples full of faith in Himself, and bold in prayer to ask great
   things, Christ can conquer the world.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O my Lord!  I have this day again heard words from Thee which pass my
   comprehension.  And yet I cannot do aught but in simple childlike faith
   take and keep them as Thy gift to me too.  Thou hast said that in
   virtue of Thy going to the Father, he that believeth on Thee will do
   the works which Thou hast done, and greater works.  Lord!  I worship
   Thee as the Glorified One, and look for the fulfilment of Thy promise.
   May my whole life just be one of continued believing in Thee.  So
   purify and sanctify my heart, make it so tenderly susceptible of
   Thyself and Thy love, that believing on Thee may be the very life it
   breathes.

   And Thou hast said that in virtue of Thy going to the Father,
   whatsoever we ask, Thou wilt do.  From Thy throne of power Thou
   wouldest make Thy people share the power given Thee, and work through
   them as the members of Thy body, in response to their believing prayers
   in Thy Name.  Power in prayer with Thee, and power in work with men, is
   what Thou has promised Thy people and me too.

   Blessed Lord!  Forgive us all that we have so little believed Thee and
   Thy promise, and so little proved Thy faithfulness in fulfilling it.  O
   forgive us that we have so little honoured Thy all-prevailing Name in
   heaven or upon earth.

   Lord!  Teach me to pray so that I may prove that Thy Name is indeed
   all-prevailing with God and men and devils.  Yea, teach me so to work
   and so to pray that Thou canst glorify Thyself in me as the Omnipotent
   One, and do Thy great work through me too.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

TWENTIETH LESSON.

  That the Father may be glorified;'

  Or,    The Chief End of Prayer.

   I go unto the Father.  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my Name, that
   will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.'--John xiv. 13.

   THAT the Father may be glorified in the Son: it is to this end that
   Jesus on His throne in glory will do all we ask in His Name.  Every
   answer to prayer He gives will have this as its object:  when there is
   no prospect of this object being obtained, He will not answer.   It
   follows as a matter of course that this must be with us, as with Jesus,
   the essential element in our petitions:  the glory of the Father must
   be the aim and end, the very soul and life of our prayer.

   It was so with Jesus when He was on earth.  I seek not mine own
   honour:  I seek the honour of Him that sent me;' in such words we have
   the keynote of His life.  In the first words of the high-priestly
   prayer He gives utterance to it:  Father! Glorify Thy son, that Thy Son
   may glorify Thee.  I have glorified Thee on earth; glorify me with
   Thyself.'  The ground on which He asks to be taken up into the glory He
   had with the Father, is the twofold one:  He has glorified Him on
   earth; He will still glorify Him in heaven.   What He asks is only to
   enable Him to glorify the Father more.  It is as we enter into sympathy
   with Jesus on this point, and gratify Him by making the Father's glory
   our chief object in prayer too, that our prayer cannot fail of an
   answer.  There is nothing of which the Beloved Son has said more
   distinctly that it will glorify the Father than this, His doing what we
   ask; He will not, therefore, let any opportunity slip of securing this
   object.  Let us make His aim ours:  let the glory of the Father be the
   link between our asking and His doing:  such prayer must prevail.^1

   This word of Jesus comes indeed as a sharp two-edged sword, piercing
   even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and quick to discern the
   thoughts and intents of the heart.  Jesus in His prayers on earth, in
   His intercession in heaven, in His promise of an answer to our prayers
   from there, makes this His first object--the glory of His Father.  Is
   it so with us too?  Or are not, in large measure, self-interest and
   self-will the strongest motives urging us to pray?  Or, if we cannot
   see that this is the case, have we not to acknowledge that the
   distinct, conscious longing for the glory of the Father is not what
   animates our prayers?  And yet it must be so.

   Not as if the believer does not at times desire it.   But he has to
   mourn that he has so little attained.  And he knows the reason of his
   failure too.  It was, because the separation between the spirit of
   daily life and the spirit of the hour of prayer was too wide.  We begin
   to see that the desire for the glory of the Father is not something
   that we can awake and present to our Lord when we prepare ourselves to
   pray.  No! it is only when the whole life, in all its parts, is given
   up to God's glory, that we can really pray to His glory too.  Do all to
   the glory of God,' and, Ask all to the glory of God,'--these twin
   commands are inseparable:  obedience to the former is the secret of
   grace for the latter.   A life to the glory of God is the condition of
   the prayers that Jesus can answer, that the Father may be glorified.'

   This demand in connection with prevailing prayer--that it should be to
   the glory of God--is no more than right and natural.  There is none
   glorious but the Lord:  there is no glory but His, and what He layeth
   on His creatures.  Creation exists to show forth His glory; all that is
   not for His glory is sin, and darkness, and death:  it is only in the
   glorifying of God that the creatures can find glory.  What the Son of
   Man did, to give Himself wholly, His whole life, to glorify the Father,
   is nothing but the simple duty of every redeemed one.  And Christ's
   reward will be his too.  Because He gave Himself so entirely to the
   glory of the Father, the Father crowned Him with glory and honour,
   giving the kingdom into His hands, with the power to ask what He will,
   and, as Intercessor, to answer our prayers.  And just as we become one
   with Christ in this, and as our prayer is part of a life utterly
   surrendered to God's glory, will the Saviour be able to glorify the
   Father to us by the fulfilment of the promise:  Whatsoever ye shall
   ask, I will do it.'

   To such a life, with God's glory our only aim, we cannot attain by any
   effort of our own.  It is only in the man Christ Jesus that such a life
   is to be seen:  in Him it is to be found for us.  Yes blessed be God!
   His life is our life; He gave Himself for us; He Himself is now our
   life.  The discovery, and the confession, and the denial, of self, as
   usurping the place of God, of self-seeking and self-trusting, is
   essential, and yet is what we cannot accomplish in our own strength.
   It is the incoming and indwelling, the Presence and the Rule in the
   heart, of our Lord Jesus who glorified the Father on earth, and is now
   glorified with Him, that thence He might glorify Him in us;--it is
   Jesus Himself  coming in, who can cast out all self-glorifying, and
   give us instead His own God-glorifying life and Spirit.  It is Jesus,
   who longs to glorify the Father in hearing our prayers, who will teach
   us to live and to pray to the glory of God.

   And what motive, what power is there that can urge our slothful hearts
   to yield themselves to our Lord to work this in us?  Surely nothing
   more is needed than a sight of how glorious, how alone worthy of glory
   the Father is.  Let our faith learn in adoring worship to bow before
   Him, to ascribe to Him alone the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
   to yield ourselves to dwell in His light as the ever-blessed,
   ever-loving One.  Surely we shall be stirred to say, To Him alone be
   glory.'  And we shall look to our Lord Jesus with new intensity of
   desire for a life that refuses to see or seek ought but the glory of
   God.  When there is but little prayer that can be answered, the Father
   is not glorified.  It is a duty, for the glory of God, to live and pray
   so that our prayer can be answered.  For the sake of God's glory, let
   us learn to pray well.

   What a humbling thought that so often there is earnest prayer for a
   child or a friend, for a work or a circle, in which the thought of our
   joy or our pleasure was far stronger than any yearnings for God's
   glory.  No wonder that there are so many unanswered prayers:  here we
   have the secret.  God would not be glorified when that glory was not
   our object.  He that would pray the prayer of faith, will have to give
   himself to live literally so that the Father in all things may be
   glorified in him.  This must be his aim:  without this there cannot be
   the prayer of faith.  How can ye believe,' said Jesus, which receive
   glory of one another, and the glory that cometh from the only God ye
   seek not?'  All seeking of our own glory with men makes faith
   impossible:  it is the deep, intense self-sacrifice that gives up its
   own glory, and seeks the glory of God alone, that wakens in the soul
   that spiritual susceptibility of the Divine, which is faith.  The
   surrender to God to seek His glory, and the expectation that He will
   show His glory in hearing us, are one at root:   He that seeks God's
   glory will see it in the answer to his prayer, and he alone.

   And how, we ask again, shall we attain to it?  Let us begin with
   confession.  How little has the glory of God been an all-absorbing
   passion; how little our lives and our prayers have been full of it.
   How little have we lived in the likeness of the Son, and in sympathy
   with Him--for God and His glory alone.  Let us take time, until the
   Holy Spirit discover it to us, and we see how wanting we have been in
   this.  True knowledge and confession of sin are the sure path to
   deliverance.

   And then let us look to Jesus.  In Him we can see by what death we can
   glorify God.  In death He glorified Him; through death He was glorified
   with Him.  It is by dying, being dead to self and living to God, that
   we can glorify Him.  And this--this death to self, this life to the
   glory of God--is what Jesus gives and lives in each one who can trust
   Him for it.  Let nothing less than these--the desire, the decision to
   live only for the glory of the Father, even as Christ did; the
   acceptance of Him with His life and strength working it in us; the
   joyful assurance that we can live to the glory of God, because Christ
   lives in us;--let this be the spirit of our daily life.   Jesus stands
   surety for our living thus; the Holy Spirit is given, and waiting to
   make it our experience, if we will only trust and let Him; O let us not
   hold back through unbelief, but confidently take as our watchword--All
   to the glory of God!  The Father accepts the will, the sacrifice is
   well-pleasing; the Holy Spirit will seal us within with the
   consciousness, we are living for God and His glory.

   And then what quiet peace and power there will be in our prayers, as we
   know ourselves through His grace, in perfect harmony with Him who says
   to us, when He promises to do what we ask:  That the Father may be
   glorified in the Son.'  With our whole being consciously yielded to the
   inspiration of the Word and Spirit, our desires will be no longer ours
   but His; their chief end the glory of God.  With increasing liberty we
   shall be able in prayer to say:  Father!  Thou knowest, we ask it only
   for Thy glory.  And the condition of prayer-answers, instead of being
   as a mountain we cannot climb, will only give us the greater confidence
   that we shall be heard, because we have seen that prayer has no higher
   beauty or blessedness than this, that it glorifies the Father.  And the
   precious privilege of prayer will become doubly precious because it
   brings us into perfect unison with the Beloved Son in the wonderful
   partnership He proposes:  You ask, and I do, that the Father may be
   glorified in the Son.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord Jesus!  I come again to Thee.  Every lesson Thou givest me
   convinces me more deeply how little I know to pray aright.  But every
   lesson also inspires me with hope that Thou art going to teach me, that
   Thou art teaching me not only to know what prayer should be, but
   actually to pray as I ought.  O my Lord!  I look with courage to Thee,
   the Great Intercessor, who didst pray and dost hear prayer, only that
   the Father may be glorified, to teach me too to live and to pray to the
   glory of God.

   Saviour!  To this end I yield myself to Thee again.  I would be
   nothing.  I have given self, as already crucified with Thee, to the
   death.  Through the Spirit its workings are mortified and made dead;
   Thy life and Thy love of the Father are taking possession of me.  A new
   longing begins to fill my soul, that every day, every hour, that in
   every prayer the glory of the Father may be everything to me.  O my
   Lord!  I am in Thy school to learn this:  teach Thou it me.

   And do Thou, the God of glory, the Father of glory, my God and my
   Father, accept the desire of a child who has seen that Thy glory is
   indeed alone worth living for.   O Lord!  Show me Thy glory.  Let it
   overshadow me.  Let it fill the temple of my heart.  Let me dwell in it
   as revealed in Christ.  And do Thou Thyself fulfil in me Thine own good
   pleasure, that Thy child should find his glory in seeking the glory of
   his Father.  Amen.

   was led to make God's glory his first object.

TWENTY-FIRST LESSON.

  If ye abide in me;'

  Or     The All-Inclusive Condition.

   If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will,
   and it shall be done unto you.'--John xv. 7.

   IN all God's intercourse with us, the promise and its conditions are
   inseparable.  If we fulfil the conditions, He fulfils the promise.
   What He is to be to us depends upon what we are willing to be to Him.
   Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.'  And so in prayer the
   unlimited promise, Ask whatsoever ye will, has its one simple and
   natural condition, if ye abide in me.  It is Christ whom the Father
   always hears; God is in Christ, and can only be reached by being in
   Him; to be IN HIM is the way to have our prayer heard; fully and wholly
   ABIDING IN HIM, we have the right to ask whatsoever we will, and the
   promise that it shall be done unto us.

   When we compare this promise with the experiences of most believers, we
   are startled by a terrible discrepancy.  Who can number up the
   countless prayers that rise and bring no answer?  The cause must be
   either that we do not fulfil the condition, or God does not fulfil the
   promise.  Believers are not willing to admit either, and therefore have
   devised a way of escape from the dilemma.  They put into the promise
   the qualifying clause our Saviour did not put there--if it be God's
   will; and so maintain both God's integrity and their own.  O if they
   did but accept it and hold it fast as it stands, trusting to Christ to
   vindicate His truth, how God's Spirit would lead them to see the Divine
   propriety of such a promise to those who really abide in Christ in the
   sense in which He means it, and to confess that the failure in the
   fulfilling the condition is the one sufficient explanation of
   unanswered prayer.  And how the Holy Spirit would then make our
   feebleness in prayer one of the mightiest motives to urge us on to
   discover the secret, and obtain the blessing, of full abiding in
   Christ.

   If ye abide in me.'  As a Christian grows in grace and in the knowledge
   of the Lord Jesus, he is often surprised to find how the words of God
   grow too, in the new and deeper meaning with which they come to him.
   He can look back to the day when some word of God was opened up to him
   and he rejoiced in the blessing he had found in it.  After a time some
   deeper experience gave it a new meaning, and it was as if he never had
   seen what it contained.  And yet once again, as he advanced in the
   Christian life, the same word stood before him again as a great
   mystery, until anew the Holy Spirit led him still deeper into its
   Divine fulness.  One of these ever-growing, never-exhausted words,
   opening up to us step by step the fulness of the Divine life, is the
   Master's precious Abide in me.'  As the union of the branch with the
   vine is one of growth, never-ceasing growth and increase, so our
   abiding in Christ is a life process in which the Divine life takes ever
   fuller and more complete possession of us.  The young and feeble
   believer may be really abiding in Christ up to the measure of his
   light; it is he who reaches onward to the full abiding in the sense in
   which the Master understood the words, who inherits all the promises
   connected with it.

   In the growing life of abiding in Christ, the first stage is that of
   faith.  As the believer sees that, with all his feebleness, the command
   is really meant for him, his great aim is simply to believe that, as he
   knows he is in Christ, so now, notwithstanding unfaithfulness and
   failure, abiding in Christ is his immediate duty, and a blessing within
   his reach.  He is specially occupied with the love, and power, and
   faithfulness of the Saviour:  he feels his one need to be believing.

   It is not long before he sees something more is needed.  Obedience and
   faith must go together.  Not as if to the faith he has the obedience
   must be added, but faith must be made manifest in obedience.  Faith is
   obedience at home and looking to the Master:  obedience is faith going
   out to do His will.  He sees how he has been more occupied with the
   privilege and the blessings of this abiding than with its duties and
   its fruit.  There has been much of self and of self-will that has been
   unnoticed or tolerated:  the peace which, as a young and feeble
   disciple, he could enjoy in believing goes from him; it is in practical
   obedience that the abiding must be maintained:  If ye keep my commands,
   ye shall abide in my love.'  As before his great aim was through the
   mind, and the truth it took hold of, to let the heart rest on Christ
   and His promises; so now, in this stage, he chief effort is to get his
   will united with the will of his Lord, and the heart and the life
   brought entirely under His rule.

   And yet it is as if there is something wanting.  The will and the heart
   are on Christ's side; he obeys and he loves his Lord.  But still, why
   is it that the fleshly nature has yet so much power, that the
   spontaneous motions and emotions of the inmost being are not what they
   should be?  The will does not approve or allow, but here is a region
   beyond control of the will.  And why also, even when there is not so
   much of positive commission to condemn, why so much of omission, the
   deficiency of that beauty of holiness, that zeal of love, that
   conformity to Jesus and His death, in which the life of self is lost,
   and which is surely implied in the abiding, as the Master meant it?
   There must surely be something in our abiding in Christ and Christ in
   us, which he has not yet experienced.

   It is so.  Faith and obedience are but the pathway of blessing.  Before
   giving us the parable of the vine and the branches, Jesus had very
   distinctly told what the full blessing is to which faith and obedience
   are to lead.  Three times over He had said, If ye love me, keep my
   commandments,' and spoken of the threefold blessing with which He would
   crown such obedient love.  The Holy Spirit would come from the Father;
   the Son would manifest Himself; the Father and the Son would come and
   make their abode.  It is as our faith grows into obedience, and in
   obedience and love our whole being goes out and clings itself to
   Christ, that our inner life becomes opened up, and the capacity is
   formed within of receiving the life, the spirit, of the glorified
   Jesus, as a distinct and conscious union with Christ and with the
   Father.  The word is fulfilled in us:  In that day ye shall know that I
   am in my Father and ye in me, and I in you.'  We understand how, just
   as Christ is in God, and God in Christ, one together not only in will
   and in love, but in identity of nature and life, because they exist in
   each other, so we are in Christ and Christ in us, in union not only of
   will and love, but of life and nature too.

   It was after Jesus had spoken of our thus through the Holy Spirit
   knowing that He is in the Father, and even so we in Him and He in us,
   that He said, Abide in me, and I in you.  Accept, consent to receive
   that Divine life of union with myself, in virtue of which, as you abide
   in me, I also abide in you, even as I abide in the Father.  So that
   your life is mine and mine is yours.'  This is the true abiding, the
   occupying of the position in which Christ can come and abide; so
   abiding in Him that the soul has come away from self to find that He
   has taken the place and become our life.  It is the becoming as little
   children who have no care, and find their happiness in trusting and
   obeying the love that has done all for them.

   To those who thus abide, the promise comes as their rightful heritage:
   Ask whatsoever ye will.  It cannot be otherwise.  Christ has got full
   possession of them.  Christ dwells in their love, their will, their
   life.  Not only has their will been given up; Christ has entered it,
   and dwells and breathes in it by His Spirit.  He whom the Father always
   hears, prays in them; they pray in Him:  what they ask shall be done
   unto them.

   Beloved fellow-believer!  let us confess that it is because we do not
   abide in Christ as He would have us, that the Church is so impotent in
   presence of the infidelity and worldliness and heathendom, in the midst
   of which the Lord is able to make her more than conqueror.  Let us
   believe that He means what He promises, and accept the condemnation the
   confession implies.

   But let us not be discouraged.  The abiding of the branch in the Vine
   is a life of never-ceasing growth.  The abiding, as the Master meant
   it, is within our reach, for He lives to give it us.  Let us but be
   ready to count all things loss, and to say, Not as though I had already
   attained; I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which I also
   am apprehended of Christ Jesus.'  Let us not be so much occupied with
   the abiding, as with Him to whom the abiding links us, and His
   fulness.  Let it be Him, the whole Christ, in His obedience and
   humiliation, in His exaltation and power, in whom our soul moves and
   acts; He Himself will fulfil His promise in us.

   And then as we abide, and grow evermore into the full abiding, let us
   exercise our right, the will to enter into all God's will.  Obeying
   what that will commands, let us claim what it promises.  Let us yield
   to the teaching of the Holy Spirit, to show each of us, according to
   his growth and measure, what the will of God is which we may claim in
   prayer.  And let us rest content with nothing less than the personal
   experience of what Jesus gave when He said, If ye abide in me, ask
   whatsoever ye will, it shall be done unto you.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY!'

   ----0----

   Beloved Lord!  do teach me to take this promise anew in all its
   simplicity, and to be sure that the only measure of Thy holy giving is
   our holy willing.  Lord!  Let each word of this Thy promise be anew
   made quick and powerful in my soul.

   Thou sayest:  Abide in me!  O my Master, my Life, my All, I do abide in
   Thee.  Give Thou me to grow up into all Thy fulness.  It is not the
   effort of faith, seeking to cling to Thee, nor even the rest of faith,
   trusting Thee to keep me; it is not the obedience of the will, nor the
   keeping the commandments; but it is Thyself living in me and in the
   Father, that alone can satisfy me.  It is Thy self, my Lord, no longer
   before me and above me, but one with me, and abiding in me; it is this
   I need, it is this I seek.  It is this I trust Thee for.

   Thou sayest:  Ask whatsoever ye will!  Lord!  I know that the life of
   full, deep abiding will so renew and sanctify and strengthen the will
   that I shall have the light and the liberty to ask great things.
   Lord!  let my will, dead in Thy death, living in Thy life, be bold and
   large in its petitions.

   Thou sayest:  It shall be done.  O Thou who art the Amen, the Faithful
   and True Witness, give me in Thyself the joyous confidence that Thou
   wilt make this word yet more wonderfully true to me than ever, because
   it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive what God hath
   prepared for them that love Him.  Amen.

   NOTE

   On a thoughtful comparison of what we mostly find in books or sermons
   on prayer, and the teaching of the Master, we shall find one great
   difference:  the importance assigned to the answer to prayer is by no
   means the same.  In the former we find a great deal on the blessing of
   prayer as a spiritual exercise even if there be no answer, and on the
   reasons why we should be content without it.  God's fellowship ought to
   be more to us than the gift we ask; God's wisdom only knows what is
   best; God may bestow something better than what He withholds.  Though
   this teaching looks very high and spiritual, it is remarkable that we
   find nothing of it with our Lord.  The more carefully we gather
   together all He spoke on prayer, the clearer it becomes that He wished
   us to think of prayer simply as the means to an end, and that the
   answer was to be the proof that we and our prayer are acceptable to the
   Father in heaven. It is not that Christ would have us count the gifts
   of higher value than the fellowship and favour of the Father.  By no
   means.  But the Father means the answer to be the token of His favour
   and of the reality of our fellowship with Him.  To-day thy servant
   knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that
   the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.'

   A life marked by daily answer to prayer is the proof of our spiritual
   maturity; that we have indeed attained to the true abiding in Christ;
   that our will is truly at one with God's will; that our faith has grown
   strong to see and take what God has prepared for us; that the Name of
   Christ and His nature have taken full possession of us; and that we
   have been found fit to take a place among those whom God admits to His
   counsels, and according to whose prayer He rules the world.  These are
   they in whom something of man's original dignity hath been restored, in
   whom, as they abide in Christ, His power as the all-prevailing
   Intercessor can manifest itself, in whom the glory of His Name is shown
   forth.   Prayer is very blessed; the answer is more blessed still, as
   the response from the Father that our prayer, our faith, our will are
   indeed as He would wish them to be.

   I make these remarks with the one desire of leading my readers
   themselves to put together all that Christ has said on prayer, and to
   yield themselves to the full impression of the truth that when prayer
   is what it should be, or rather when we are what we should be, abiding
   in Christ, the answer must be expected.  It will bring us out from
   those refuges where we have comforted ourselves with unanswered
   prayer.  It will discover to us the place of power to which Christ has
   appointed His Church, and which it so little occupies.  It will reveal
   the terrible feebleness of our spiritual life as the cause of our not
   knowing to pray boldly in Christ's Name.  It will urge us mightily to
   rise to a life in the full union with Christ, and in the fulness of the
   Spirit, as the secret of effectual prayer.  And it will so lead us on
   to realize our destiny:  At that day:  Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   If ye shall ask anything of the Father, He will give it you in my
   Name:  ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled.'
   Prayer that is really, spiritually, in union with Jesus, is always
   answered.
     __________________________________________________________________

TWENTY-SECOND LESSON.

  My words in you.'

  Or,    The Word and Prayer.

   If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will,
   and it shall be done unto you.'--John xv. 7.

   THE vital connection between the word and prayer is one of the simplest
   and earliest lessons of the Christian life.  As that newly-converted
   heathen put it:  I pray--I speak to my father; I read--my Father speaks
   to me.  Before prayer, it is God's word that prepares me for it by
   revealing what the Father has bid me ask.  In prayer, it is God's word
   strengthens me by giving my faith its warrant and its plea.  And after
   prayer, it is God's word that brings me the answer when I have prayed,
   for in it the Spirit gives me to hear the Father's voice.  Prayer is
   not monologue but dialogue; God's voice in response to mine in its most
   essential part.  Listening to God's voice is the secret of the
   assurance that He will listen to mine.  Incline thine ear, and hear;'
   Give ear to me;' Hearken to my voice;' are words which God speaks to
   man as well as man to God.  His hearkening will depend on ours; the
   entrance His words find with me, will be the measure of the power of my
   words with Him.   What God's words are to me, is the test of what He
   Himself is to me, and so of the uprightness of my desire after Him in
   prayer.

   It is this connection between His word and our prayer that Jesus points
   to when He says, If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask
   whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.'  The deep
   importance of this truth becomes clear if we notice the other
   expression of which this one has taken the place.  More than once Jesus
   had said, "Abide in me and I in you.'  His abiding in us was the
   complement and the crown of our abiding in Him. But here, instead of Ye
   in me and I in you,' He says, Ye in me and my words in you.'  His words
   abiding are the equivalent of Himself abiding.

   What a view is here opened up to us of the place the words of God in
   Christ are to have in our spiritual life, and especially in our
   prayer.  In a man's words he reveals himself.  In his promises he gives
   himself away, he binds himself to the one who receives his promise.  In
   his commands he sets forth his will, seeks to make himself master of
   him whose obedience he claims, to guide and use him as if he were part
   of himself.  It is through our words that spirit holds fellowship with
   spirit, that the spirit of one man passes over and transfers itself
   into another.  It is through the words of a man, heard and accepted,
   and held fast and obeyed, that he can impart himself to another.  But
   all this in a very relative and limited sense.

   But when God, the infinite Being, in whom everything is life and power,
   spirit and truth, in the very deepest meaning of the words,--when God
   speaks forth Himself in His words, He does indeed give HIMSELF, His
   Love and His Life, His Will and His Power, to those who receive these
   words, in a reality passing comprehension.  In every promise He puts
   Himself in our power to lay hold of and possess; in every command He
   puts Himself in our power for us to share with Him His Will, His
   Holiness, His Perfection.  In God's Word God gives us HIMSELF; His Word
   is nothing less than the Eternal Son, Christ Jesus.  And so all
   Christ's words are God's words, full of a Divine quickening life and
   power.  The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are
   life.'

   Those who have made the deaf and dumb their study, tell us how much the
   power of speaking depends on that of hearing, and how the loss of
   hearing in children is followed by that of speaking too.  This is true
   in a wider sense:  as we hear, so we speak.  This is true in the
   highest sense of our intercourse with God.  To offer a prayer--to give
   utterance to certain wishes and to appeal to certain promises--is an
   easy thing, and can be learned of man by human wisdom.  But to pray in
   the Spirit, to speak words that reach and touch God, that affect and
   influence the powers of the unseen world,--such praying, such speaking,
   depends entirely upon our hearing God's voice.  Just as far as we
   listen to the voice and language that God speaks, and in the words of
   God receive His thoughts, His mind, His life, into our heart, we shall
   learn to speak in the voice and the language that God hears.  It is the
   ear of the learner, wakened morning by morning, that prepares for the
   tongue of the learned, to speak to God as well as men, as should be
   (Isa. l. 4).

   This hearing the voice of God is something more than the thoughtful
   study of the Word.  There may be a study and knowledge of the Word, in
   which there is but little real fellowship with the living God.  But
   there is also a reading of the Word, in the very presence of the
   Father, and under the leading of the Spirit, in which the Word comes to
   us in living power from God Himself; it is to us the very voice of the
   Father, a real personal fellowship with Himself.  It is the living
   voice of God that enters the heart, that brings blessing and strength,
   and awakens the response of a living faith that reaches the heart of
   God again.

   It is on this hearing the voice, that the power both to obey and
   believe depends.  The chief thing is, not to know what God has said we
   must do, but that God Himself says it to us.  It is not the law, and
   not the book, not the knowledge of what is right, that works obedience,
   but the personal influence of God and His living fellowship.  And even
   so it is not the knowledge of what God has promised, but the presence
   of God Himself  as the Promiser, that awakens faith and trust in
   prayer.  It is only in the full presence of God that disobedience and
   unbelief become impossible.

   If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will,
   it shall be done unto you.'  We see what this means.  In the words the
   Saviour gives Himself.  We must have the words in us, taken up into our
   will and life, reproduced in our disposition and conduct.  We must have
   them abiding in us:  our whole life one continued exposition of the
   words that are within, and filling us; the words revealing Christ
   within, and our life revealing Him without.  It is as the words of
   Christ enter our very heart, become our life and influence it, that our
   words will enter His heart and influence Him.  My prayer will depend on
   my life; what God's words are to me and in me, my words will be to God
   and in God.  If I do what God says, God will do what I say.

   How well the Old Testament saints understood this connection between
   God's words and ours, and how really prayer with them was the loving
   response to what they had heard God speak!  If the word were a promise,
   they counted on God to do as He had spoken.  Do as Thou hast said;' For
   Thou, Lord, hast spoken it;' According to Thy promise;' According to
   Thy word;' in such expressions they showed that what God spake in
   promise was the root and the life of what they spake in prayer.  If the
   word was a command, they simply did as the Lord had spoken:  So Abram
   departed as the Lord had spoken.'  Their life was fellowship with God,
   the interchange of word and thought.  What God spoke they heard and
   did; what they spoke God heard and did.  In each word He speaks to us,
   the whole Christ gives Himself to fulfil it for us. For each word He
   asks no less that we give the whole man to keep that word, and to
   receive its fulfilment.

   If my words abide in you;' the condition is simple and clear.  In His
   words His will is revealed.  As the words abide in me, His will rules
   me; my will becomes the empty vessel which His will fills, the willing
   instrument which His will wields; He fills my inner being.  In the
   exercise of obedience and faith my will becomes ever stronger, and is
   brought into deeper inner harmony with Him.  He can fully trust it to
   will nothing but what He wills; He is not afraid to give the promise,
   If my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, it shall be done unto
   you.'  To all who believe it, and act upon it, He will make it
   literally true.

   Disciples of Christ!  is it not becoming more and more clear to us that
   while we have been excusing our unanswered prayers, our impotence in
   prayer, with a fancied submission to God's wisdom and will, the real
   reason has been that our own feeble life has been the cause of our
   feeble prayers.  Nothing can make strong men but the word coming to us
   from God's mouth:  by that we must live.  It is the word of Christ,
   loved, lived in, abiding in us, becoming through obedience and action
   part of our being, that makes us one with Christ, that fits us
   spiritually for touching, for taking hold of God.  All that is of the
   world passeth away; he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  O
   let us yield heart and life to the words of Christ, the words in which
   He ever gives HIMSELF, the personal living Saviour, and His promise
   will be our rich experience:  If ye abide in me, and my words abide in
   you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.'


   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY!'

   ----0------

   Blessed Lord!  Thy lesson this day has again discovered to me my
   folly.  I see how it is that my prayer has not been more believing and
   prevailing.  I was more occupied with my speaking to Thee than Thy
   speaking to me.  I did not understand that the secret of faith is this:
    there can be only so much faith as there is of the Living Word
   dwelling in the soul.

   And Thy word had taught me so clearly:  Let every man be swift to hear,
   slow to speak; let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before
   God.  Lord, teach me that it is only with Thy word taken up into my
   life that my words can be taken into Thy heart; that Thy word, if it be
   a living power within me, will be a living power with Thee; what Thy
   mouth hath spoken Thy hand will perform.

   Lord!   deliver me from the uncircumcised ear.  Give me the opened ear
   of the learner, wakened morning by morning to hear the Father's voice.
   Even as Thou didst only speak what Thou didst hear, may my speaking be
   the echo of Thy speaking to me.  When Moses went into the tabernacle to
   speak with Him, he heard the voice of One speaking unto him from off
   the mercy-seat.'  Lord, may it be so with me too.  Let a life and
   character bearing the one mark, that Thy words abide and are seen in
   it, be the preparation for the full blessing:  Ask whatsoever ye will,
   and it shall be done unto you.'  Amen.

TWENTY-THIRD LESSON

  Bear fruit, that the Father may give what ye ask;'

  Or,          Obedience the Path to Power in Prayer.

   Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye
   should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide:  that
   whatsoever ye shall ask  the Father in my name, He may give it
   you.'--John xv. 16.

   The fervent effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.'--James.
   v. 16.

   THE promise of the Father's giving whatsoever we ask is here once again
   renewed, in such a connection as to show us to whom it is that such
   wonderful influence in the council chamber of the Most High is to be
   granted.  I chose you,' the Master says, and appointed you that ye
   should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide;' and then
   He adds, to the end that whatsoever ye,' the fruit-bearing ones, shall
   ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you.'  This is nothing but
   the fuller expression of what He had spoken in the words, If ye abide
   in me.'  He had spoken of the object of this abiding as the bearing
   fruit,' more fruit,' much fruit;' in this was God to be glorified, and
   the mark of discipleship seen.  No wonder that He now adds, that where
   the reality of the abiding is seen in fruit abounding and abiding, this
   would be the qualification for praying so as to obtain what we ask.
   Entire consecration to the fulfilment of our calling is the condition
   of effectual prayer, is the key to the unlimited blessings of Christ's
   wonderful prayer-promises.

   There are Christians who fear that such a statement is at variance with
   the doctrine of free grace.  But surely not of free grace rightly
   understood, nor with so many express statements of God's blessed word.
   Take the words of St. John (1 John iii. 22):  Let us love in deed and
   truth; hereby shall we assure our heart before Him.  And whatsoever we
   ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do the
   things that are pleasing in His sight.'' Or take the oft-quoted words
   of James: The fervent effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth
   much;' that is, of a man of whom, according to the definition of the
   Holy Spirit, it can be said, He that doeth righteousness, is righteous
   even as He is righteous.'  Mark the spirit of so many of the Psalms,
   with their confident appeal to the integrity and righteousness of the
   supplicant.  In Ps. xviii, David says:  The Lord rewarded me according
   to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He
   recompensed me. . . . I was upright before Him, and I kept myself from
   mine iniquity: therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my
   righteousness.'  (Ps. xviii. 20-26.  See also Ps. vii. 3-5, xv. 1, 2,
   xviii. 3, 6, xxvi. 1-6, cxix. 121, 153.)  If we carefully consider such
   utterances in the light of the New Testament, we shall find them in
   perfect harmony with the explicit teaching of the Saviour's parting
   words:  If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love;' Ye are
   my friends if ye do what I command you.'   The word is indeed meant
   literally:  I appointed you that ye should go and bear fruit, that,'
   then, whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it
   you.'

   Let us seek to enter into the spirit of what the Saviour here teaches
   us.  There is a danger in our evangelical religion of looking too much
   at what it offers from one side, as a certain experience to be obtained
   in prayer and faith.  There is another side which God's word puts very
   strongly, that of obedience as the only path to blessing.  What we need
   is to realize that in our  relationship to the Infinite Being whom we
   call God who has created and redeemed us, the first sentiment that
   ought to animate us is that of subjection:  the surrender to His
   supremacy, His glory, His will, His pleasure, ought to be the first and
   uppermost thought of our life.  The question is not, how we are to
   obtain and enjoy His favour, for in this the main thing may still be
   self.  But what this Being in the very nature of things rightfully
   claims, and is infinitely and unspeakably worthy of, is that His glory
   and pleasure should be my one object.  Surrender to His perfect and
   blessed will, a life of service and obedience, is the beauty and the
   charm of heaven.  Service and obedience, these were the thoughts that
   were uppermost in the mind of the Son, when He dwelt upon earth.
   Service and obedience, these must become with us the chief objects of
   desire and aim, more so than rest or light, or joy or strength:  in
   them we shall find the path to all the higher blessedness that awaits
   us.

    Just note what a prominent place the Master gives it, not only in the
   15^th chapter, in connection with the abiding, but in the 14^th, where
   He speaks of the indwelling of the Three-One God.  In verse 15 we have
   it:  If ye love me, keep my commandments, and the Spirit will be given
   you of the Father.  Then verse 21:  He that hath my commandments and
   keepeth them, he it is that loveth me;' and he shall have the special
   love of my Father resting on him and the special manifestation of
   myself.  And then again, verse 23, one of the highest of all the
   exceeding great and precious promises:  If a man love me he will keep
   my words, and the Father and I will come and take up our abode with
   him.'  Could words put it more clearly that obedience is the way to the
   indwelling of the Spirit, to His revealing the Son within us, and to
   His again preparing us to be the abode, the home of the Father?  The
   indwelling of the Three-One God is the heritage of them that obey.
   Obedience and faith are but two aspects of one act,--surrender to God
   and His will.  As faith strengthens for obedience, it is in turn
   strengthened by it:  faith is made perfect by works.  It is to be
   feared that often our efforts to believe have been unavailing because
   we have not taken up the only position in which a large faith is
   legitimate or possible,--that of entire surrender to the honour and the
   will of God.  It is the man who is entirely consecrated to God and His
   will who will find the power come to claim everything that His God has
   promised to be for him.

   The application of this in the school of prayer is very simple, but
   very solemn.  I chose you,' the Master says, and appointed you that ye
   should go and bear fruit,' much fruit (verses 5, 8), and that your
   fruit should abide,' that your life might be one of abiding fruit and
   abiding fruitfulness, that' thus, as fruitful branches abiding in me,
   whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you.'
   O how often we have sought to be able to pray the effectual prayer for
   much grace to bear fruit, and have wondered that the answer came not.
   It was because we were reversing the Master's order.  We wanted to have
   the comfort and the joy and the strength first, that we might do the
   work easily and without any feeling of difficulty or self-sacrifice.
   And He wanted us in faith, without asking whether we felt weak or
   strong, whether the work was hard or easy, in the obedience of faith to
   do what He said:  the path of fruit-bearing would have led us to the
   place and the power of prevailing prayer.  Obedience is the only path
   that leads to the glory of God.  Not obedience instead of faith, nor
   obedience to supply the shortcomings of faith; no, but faith's
   obedience gives access to all the blessings our God has for us.  The
   baptism of the Spirit (xiv. 16), the manifestation of the Son (xiv.
   21), the indwelling of the Father (xiv. 23), the abiding in Christ's
   love (xv. 10), the privilege of His holy friendship (xv. 14), and the
   power of all-prevailing prayer (xv. 16),--all wait for the obedient.

   Let us take home the lessons.  Now we know the great reason why we have
   not had power in faith to pray prevailingly.  Our life was not as it
   should have been:  simple downright obedience, abiding fruitfulness,
   was not its chief mark.  And with our whole heart we approve of the
   Divine appointment:  men to whom God is to give such influence in the
   rule of the world, as at their request to do what otherwise would not
   have taken place, men whose will is to guide the path in which God's
   will is to work, must be men who have themselves learned obedience,
   whose loyalty and submission to authority must be above all suspicion.
   Our whole soul approves the law:  obedience and fruit-bearing, the path
   to prevailing prayer.   And with shame we acknowledge how little our
   lives have yet borne this stamp.

   Let us yield ourselves to take up the appointment the Saviour gives
   us.  Let us study His relation to us as Master.  Let us seek no more
   with each new day to think in the first place of comfort, or joy, or
   blessing.  Let the first thought be:  I belong to the Master.  Every
   moment and every movement I must act as His property, as a part of
   Himself, as one who only seeks to know and do His will.   A servant, a
   slave of Jesus Christ,--let this be the spirit that animates me.  If He
   says, No longer do I call you servants, but I have called you friends,'
   let us accept the place of friends:  Ye are my friends if ye do the
   things which I command you.'

   The one thing He commands us as His branches is to bear fruit.   Let us
   live to bless others, to testify of the life and the love there is in
   Jesus.  Let us in faith and obedience give our whole life to that which
   Jesus chose us for and appointed us to--fruit-bearing.  As we think of
   His electing us to this, and take up our appointment as coming from Him
   who always gives all He demands, we shall grow strong in the confidence
   that a life of fruit-bearing, abounding and abiding, is within our
   reach.  And we shall understand why this fruit-bearing alone can be the
   path to the place of all prevailing prayer.  It is the man who, in
   obedience to the Christ of God, is proving that he is doing what his
   Lord wills, for whom the Father will do whatsoever he will:  Whatsoever
   we ask we receive, because we keep His commandments, and do the things
   that are pleasing in His sight.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Master!  teach me to apprehend fully what I only partly
   realize, that it is only through the will of God, accepted and acted
   out in obedience to His commands, that we obtain the power to grasp His
   will in His promises and fully to appropriate them in our prayers.  And
   teach me that it is in the path of fruit-bearing that the deeper growth
   of the branch into the Vine can be perfected, and we attain to the
   perfect oneness with Thyself in which we ask whatsoever we will.

   O Lord!  Reveal to us,  we pray Thee, how with all the hosts of heaven,
   and with Thyself the Son on earth, and with all the men of faith who
   have glorified Thee on earth, obedience to God is our highest
   privilege, because it gives access to oneness with Himself in that
   which is His highest glory--His all perfect will.  And reveal to us, we
   pray Thee, how in keeping Thy commandments and bearing fruit according
   to Thy will, our spiritual nature will grow up to the full stature of
   the perfect man, with power to ask and to receive whatsoever we will.

   O Lord Jesus!  Reveal Thyself to us, and the reality of Thy purpose and
   Thy power to make these Thy wonderful promises the daily experience of
   all who utterly yield themselves to Thee and Thy words.  Amen.

TWENTY-FOURTH LESSON.

   In my Name;'

  Or,    The All-prevailing Plea.

   Whatsoever ye shall ask in my Name, that will I do.  If ye shall ask me
   anything in my Name, that will I do.  That whatsoever ye shall ask the
   Father in my Name, He may give it you.  Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   If ye shall ask anything of the Father, He will give it you in my
   Name.  Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my Name:  ask, and ye shall
   receive.  In that day ye shall ask in my Name.'--John xiv. 13, 14, xv.
   16, xvi. 23, 24, 26.

   HITHERTO the disciples had not asked in the Name of Christ, nor had He
   Himself ever used the expression.  The nearest approach is, met
   together in my Name.'  Here in His parting words, He repeats the word
   unceasingly in connection with those promises of unlimited meaning,
   Whatsoever,' Anything,' What ye will,' to teach them and us that His
   Name is our only, but also our all-sufficient plea.  The power of
   prayer and the answer depend on the right use of the Name.

   What is a person's name?  That word or expression in which the person
   is called up or represented to us.  When I mention or hear a name, it
   calls up before me the whole man, what I know of him, and also the
   impression he has made on me.  The name of a king includes his honour,
   his power, his kingdom.  His name is the symbol of his power.  And so
   each name of God embodies and represents some part of the glory of the
   Unseen One.  And the Name of Christ is the expression of all He has
   done and all He is and lives to do as our Mediator.

   And what is it to do a thing in the name of another?  It is to come
   with the power and authority of that other, as his representative and
   substitute.  We know how such a use of another's name always supposes a
   community of interest.  No one would give another the free use of his
   name without first being assured that his honour and interest were as
   safe with that other as with himself.

   And what is it when Jesus gives us power over His Name, the free use of
   it, with the assurance that whatever we ask in it will be given to us?
   The ordinary comparison of one person giving another, on some special
   occasion, the liberty to ask something in his name, comes altogether
   short here,--Jesus solemnly gives to all His disciples a general and
   unlimited power of the free use of His Name at  all  times for all they
   desire.  He could not do this if He did not know that He could trust us
   with His interests, that His honour would be safe in our hands.  The
   free use of the name of another is always the token of great
   confidence, of close union.  He who gives his name to another stands
   aside, to let that other act for him; he who takes the name of another,
   gives up his own as of no value.  When I go in the name of another, I
   deny myself, I take not only his name, but himself and what he is,
   instead of myself and what I am.

   Such a use of the name of a person may be in virtue of a legal union.
   A merchant leaving his home and business, gives his chief clerk a
   general power, by which he can draw thousands of pounds in the
   merchant's name.  The clerk does this, not for himself, but only in the
   interests of the business.  It is because the merchant knows and trusts
   him as wholly devoted to his interests and business, that he dares put
   his name and property at his command.  When the Lord Jesus went to
   heaven, He left His work, the management of His kingdom on earth, in
   the hands of His servants.  He could not do otherwise than also give
   them His Name to draw all the supplies they needed for the due conduct
   of His business.  And they have the spiritual power to avail themselves
   of the Name of Jesus just to the extent to which they yield themselves
   to live only for the interests and the work of the Master.  The use of
   the Name always supposes the surrender of our interests to Him whom we
   represent.

   Or such a use of the name may be in virtue of a life union.  In the
   case of the merchant and his clerk, the union is temporary.  But we
   know how oneness of life on earth gives oneness of name:  a child has
   the father's name because he has his life.  And often the child of a
   good father has been honoured or helped by others for the sake of the
   name he bore.  But this would not last long if it were found that it
   was only a name, and that the father's character was wanting.  The name
   and the character or spirit must be in harmony.  When such is the case,
   the child will have a double claim on the father's friends:  the
   character secures and increases the love and esteem rendered first for
   the name's sake.   So it is with Jesus and the believer:  we are one,
   we have one life, one Spirit with Him; for this reason we may come in
   His Name.  Our power in using that Name, whether with God, or men, or
   devils depends on the measure of our spiritual life-union.  The use of
   the name rests on the unity of life; the Name and the Spirit of Jesus
   are one. [2]

   Or the union that empowers to the use of the Name may be the union of
   love.  When a bride whose life has been one of poverty, becomes united
   to the bridegroom, she gives up her own name, to be called by his, and
   has now the full right to use it.  She purchases in his name, and that
   name is not refused.  And this is done because the bridegroom has
   chosen her for himself, counting on her to care for his interests:
   they are now one.  And so the Heavenly Bridegroom could do nothing
   less; having loved us and made us one with Himself, what could He do
   but give those who bear His Name the right to present it before the
   Father, or to come with it to Himself for all they need.  And there is
   no one who gives himself really to live in the Name of Jesus, who does
   not receive in ever-increasing measure the spiritual capacity to ask
   and receive in that Name what he will.  The bearing of the name of
   another supposes my having given up my own, and with it my own
   independent life; but then, as surely, my possession of all there is in
   the name I have taken instead of my own.

   Such illustrations show us how defective the common view is of a
   messenger sent to ask in the name of another, or a guilty one appealing
   to the name of a surety.  No Jesus Himself is with the Father; it is
   not an absent one in whose name we come.  Even when we pray to Jesus
   Himself, it must be in His Name.  The name represents the person; to
   ask in the Name is to ask in full union of interest and life and love
   with Himself, as one who lives in and for Him.  Let the Name of Jesus
   only have undivided supremacy in my heart and life, my faith will grow
   to the assurance that what I ask in that Name cannot be refused.  The
   name and the power of asking go together:   when the Name of Jesus has
   become the power that rules my life, its power in prayer with God will
   be seen too.

   We see thus that everything depends on our own relation to the Name:
   the power it has on my life is the power it will have in my prayers.
   There is more than one expression in Scripture which can make this
   clear to us.  When it says, Do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus,' we
   see how this is the counterpart of the other, Ask all.'  To do all and
   to ask all in His Name, these go together.  When we read, We shall walk
   in the Name of our God,' we see how the power of the Name must rule in
   the whole life; only then will it have power in prayer.  It is not to
   the lips but to the life God looks to see what the Name is to us.  When
   Scripture speaks of men who have given their lives for the Name of the
   Lord Jesus,' or of one ready to die for the Name of the Lord Jesus,' we
   see what our relation to the Name must be:  when it is everything to
   me, it will obtain everything for me.  If I let it have all I have, it
   will let me have all it has.

   WHATSOEVER ye shall ask in my Name, that will I do.'  Jesus means the
   promise literally.  Christians have sought to limit it:  it looked too
   free; it was hardly safe to trust man so unconditionally.  We did not
   understand that the word in my Name' is its own safeguard.  It is a
   spiritual power which no one can use further than he obtains the
   capacity for, by his living and acting in that Name.  As we bear that
   Name before men, we have power to use it before God.  O let us plead
   for God's Holy Spirit to show us what the Name means, and what the
   right use of it is.  It is through the Spirit that the Name, which is
   above every name in heaven, will take the place of supremacy in our
   heart and life too.

   Disciples of Jesus!  Let the lessons of this day enter deep into your
   hearts.  The Master says:  Only pray in my Name; whatsoever ye ask will
   be given.  Heaven is set open to you; the treasures and powers of the
   world of spirit are placed at your disposal on behalf of men around
   you.  O come, and let us learn to pray in the Name of Jesus.  As to the
   disciples, He says to us, Hitherto ye have not asked in my Name:  ask,
   and ye shall receive.'  Let each disciple of Jesus seek to avail
   himself of the rights of his royal priesthood, and use the power placed
   at his disposal for his circle and his work.  Let Christians awake and
   hear the message:  your prayer can obtain what otherwise will be
   withheld, can accomplish what otherwise remains undone.  O awake, and
   use the name of Jesus to open the treasures of heaven for this
   perishing world.  Learn as the servants of the King to use His Name:
   WHATSOEVER ye shall ask in my Name, THAT WILL I DO.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord!  It is as if each lesson Thou givest me has such fulness
   and depths of meaning, that if I can only learn that one, I shall know
   how to pray aright.  This day I feel again as if I needed but one
   prayer every day:  Lord!  Teach me what it is to pray in Thy Name.
   Teach me so to live and act, to walk and speak, so to do all in the
   Name of Jesus, that my prayer cannot be anything else but in that
   blessed Name too.

   And teach me, Lord!  to hold fast the precious promise that WHATSOEVER
   we ask in Thy Name, Thou wilt do, the Father will give.  Though I do
   not yet fully understand, and still less have fully attained, the
   wondrous union Thou meanest when Thou sayest, IN MY NAME, I would yet
   hold fast the promise until it fills my heart with the undoubting
   assurance:  Anything in the Name of Jesus.

   O my Lord!  let Thy Holy Spirit teach me this.  Thou didst say of Him,
   The Comforter, whom the Father shall send IN MY NAME.'  He knows what
   it is to be sent from heaven in Thy Name, to reveal and to honour the
   power of that Name in Thy servants, to use that Name alone, and so to
   glorify Thee.  Lord Jesus!  let Thy Spirit dwell in me, and fill me.  I
   would, I do yield my whole being to His rule and leading.  Thy Name and
   Thy Spirit are one; through Him Thy Name will be the strength of my
   life and my prayer.  Then I shall be able for Thy Name's sake to
   forsake all, in Thy Name to speak to men and to God, and to prove that
   this is indeed the Name above every name.

   Lord Jesus!  O teach me by Thy Holy Spirit to pray in Thy Name.  Amen.

   NOTE.

   What is meant by praying in Christ's name?  It cannot mean simply
   appearing before God with faith in the mediation of the Saviour.  When
   the disciples asked Jesus to teach them to pray, He supplied them with
   petitions.  And afterwards Jesus said to them, "Hitherto have ye asked
   nothing in my Name."  Until the Spirit came, the seven petitions of the
   Lord's prayer lay as it were dormant within them.  When by the Holy
   Ghost Christ descended into their hearts, they desired the very
   blessings which Christ as our High Priest obtains for us by His prayer
   from the Father.  And such petitions are always answered.  The Father
   is always willing to give what Christ asks.  The Spirit of Christ
   always teaches and influences us to offer the petitions which Christ
   ratifies and presents to the Father.  To pray in Christ's name is
   therefore to be identified with Christ as to our righteousness, and to
   be identified with Christ in our desires by the indwelling of the Holy
   Ghost.  To pray in the Spirit, to pray according to the will of the
   Father, to pray in Christ's name, are identical expressions.  The
   Father Himself loveth us, and is willing to hear us:  two intercessors,
   Christ the Advocate above, and the Holy Ghost, the Advocate within, are
   the gifts of His love.

   This view may appear at first less consoling than a more prevalent one,
   which refers prayer in Christ's name chiefly to our trust in Christ's
   merit.  The defect of this opinion is, that it does not combine the
   intercession of the Saviour with the will of the Father, and the
   indwelling Spirit's aid in prayer.  Nor does it fully realize the
   mediation of Christ; for the mediation consists not merely in that for
   Christ's sake the Holy Father is able to regard me and my prayer; but
   also, in that Christ Himself presents my petitions as His petitions,
   desired by Him for me, even as all blessings are purchased for me by
   His precious blood.

   In all prayer, the one essential condition is that we are able to offer
   it in the name of Jesus, as according to His desire for us, according
   to the Father's will, according to the Spirit's teaching.  And thus
   praying in Christ's name is impossible without self-examination,
   without reflection, without self-denial; in short, without the aid of
   the Spirit.'--Saphiv, The Lord's Prayer, pp. 411, 142.

     __________________________________________________________________

TWENTY-FIFTH LESSON.

  At that day;'

  Or,    The Holy Spirit and Prayer.

   In that day ye shall ask me nothing.   Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my Name, He will give it you.
   Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my Name:  ask, and ye shall receive,
   that your joy may be full.  At that day ye shall ask in my Name:   and
   I say not, that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father Himself
   loveth you.'--John xvi. 23-26.

   Praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God.'--Jude
   20, 21.

   THE words of John (I John ii. 12-14) to little children, to young men,
   and to fathers suggest the thought that there often are in the
   Christian life three great stages of experience.  The first, that of
   the new-born child, with the assurance and the joy of forgiveness.  The
   second, the transition stage of struggle and growth in knowledge and
   strength:  young men growing strong, God's word doing its work in them
   and giving them victory over the Evil One.  And then the final stage of
   maturity and ripeness:  the Fathers, who have entered deeply into the
   knowledge and fellowship of the Eternal One.

   In Christ's teaching on prayer there appear to be three stages in the
   prayer-life, somewhat analogous.  In the Sermon on the Mount we have
   the initial stage:  His teaching is all comprised in one word, Father.
   Pray to your Father, your Father sees, hears, knows, and will reward:
   how much more than any earthly father!  Only be childlike and
   trustful.  Then comes later on something like the transition stage of
   conflict and conquest, in words like these:  This sort goeth not out
   but by fasting and prayer;' Shall not God avenge His own elect who cry
   day and night unto Him?'  And then we have in the parting words, a
   higher stage.  The children have become men:  they are now the Master's
   friends, from whom He has no secrets, to whom He says, All things that
   I heard from my Father I made known unto you;' and to whom, in the
   oft-repeated whatsoever ye will,' He hands over the keys of the
   kingdom.  Now the time has come for the power of prayer in His Name to
   be proved.

   The contrast between this final stage and the previous preparatory ones
   our Saviour marks most distinctly in the words we are to meditate on:
   Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my Name;' At that day ye shall ask in
   my Name.   We know what at that day' means.  It is the day of the
   outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  The great work Christ was to do on the
   cross, the mighty power and the complete victory to be manifested in
   His resurrection and ascension, were to issue in the coming down from
   heaven, as never before, of the glory of God to dwell in men.  The
   Spirit of the glorified Jesus was to come and be the life of His
   disciples.  And one of the marks of that wonderful spirit-dispensation
   was to be a power in prayer hitherto unknown--prayer in the Name of
   Jesus, asking and obtaining whatsoever they would, is to be the
   manifestation of the reality of the Spirit's indwelling.

   To understand how the coming of the Holy Spirit was indeed to commence
   a new epoch in the prayer-world, we must remember who He is, what His
   work, and what the significance of His not being given until Jesus was
   glorified.  It is in the Spirit that God exists, for He is Spirit.  It
   is in the Spirit that the Son was begotten of the Father:  it is in the
   fellowship of the Spirit that the Father and the Son are one.  The
   eternal never-ceasing giving to the Son which is the Father's
   prerogative and the eternal asking and receiving which is the Son's
   right and blessedness--it is through the Spirit that this communion of
   life and love is maintained.  It has been so from all eternity.  It is
   so specially now, when the Son as Mediator ever liveth to pray.  The
   great work which Jesus began on earth of reconciling in His own body
   God and man, He carries on in heaven.  To accomplish this He took up
   into His own person the conflict between God's righteousness and our
   sin.  On the cross He once for all ended the struggle in His own body.
   And then He ascended to heaven, that thence He might in each member of
   His body carry out the deliverance and manifest the victory He had
   obtained.  It is to do this that He ever liveth to pray; in His
   unceasing intercession He places Himself in living fellowship with the
   unceasing prayer of His redeemed ones.  Or rather, it is His unceasing
   intercession which shows itself in their prayers, and gives them a
   power they never had before.

   And He does this through the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit, the Spirit
   of the glorified Jesus, was not (John vii. 39), could not be, until He
   had been glorified.  This gift of the Father was something
   distinctively new, entirely different from what Old Testament saints
   had known.  The work that the blood effected in heaven when Christ
   entered within the veil, was something so true and new, the redemption
   of our human nature into fellowship with His resurrection-power and His
   exaltation-glory was so intensely real, the taking up of our humanity
   in Christ into the life of the Three-One God was an event of such
   inconceivable significance, that the Holy Spirit, who had to come from
   Christ's exalted humanity to testify in our hearts of what Christ had
   accomplished, was indeed no longer only what He had been in the Old
   Testament.  It was literally true the Holy Spirit was not yet, for
   Christ was not yet glorified.'  He came now first as the Spirit of the
   glorified Jesus.  Even as the Son, who was from eternity God, had
   entered upon a new existence as man, and returned to heaven with what
   He had not before, so the Blessed Spirit, whom the Son, on His
   ascension, received from the Father (Acts ii. 33) into His glorified
   humanity, came to us with a new life, which He had not previously to
   communicate.  Under the Old Testament He was invoked as the Spirit of
   God:  at Pentecost He descended as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus,
   bringing down and communicating to us the full fruit and power of the
   accomplished redemption.

   It is in the intercession of Christ that the continued efficacy and
   application of His redemption is maintained.  And it is through the
   Holy Spirit descending from Christ to us that we are drawn up into the
   great stream of His ever-ascending prayers.  The Spirit prays for us
   without words:  in the depths of a heart where even thoughts are at
   times formless, the Spirit takes us up into the wonderful flow of the
   life of the Three-One God.  Through the Spirit, Christ's prayers become
   ours, and ours are made His:  we ask what we will, and it is given to
   us.  We then understand from experience, Hitherto ye have not asked in
   my Name.  At that day ye shall ask in my Name.'

   Brother!  what we need to pray in the Name of Christ, to ask that we
   may receive that our joy may be full, is the baptism of this Holy
   Ghost.  This is more than the Spirit of God under  the Old Testament.
   This is more than the Spirit of conversion and regeneration the
   disciples had before Pentecost.  This is more than the Spirit with a
   measure of His influence  and working.  This is the Holy Spirit, the
   Spirit of the glorified Jesus in His exaltation-power, coming on us as
   the Spirit of the indwelling Jesus, revealing the Son and the Father
   within.  (John xiv. 16-23.)  It is when this Spirit is the Spirit not
   of our hours of prayer, but of our whole life and walk, when this
   Spirit glorifies Jesus in us by revealing the completeness of His work,
   and making us wholly one with Him and like Him, that we can pray in His
   Name, because we are in very deed one with Him.  Then it is that we
   have that immediateness of access to the Father of which Jesus says, I
   say not that I will pray the Father for you.'  Oh!  we need to
   understand and believe that to be filled with this, the Spirit of the
   glorified One, is the one need of God's believing people.  Then shall
   we realize what it is, with all prayer and supplication to be praying
   at all seasons in the Spirit,' and what it is, praying in the Holy
   Ghost, to keep ourselves in the love of God.'  At that day ye shall ask
   in my Name.'

   And so once again the lesson comes:  What our prayer avails, depends
   upon what we are and what our life is.  It is living in the Name of
   Christ that is the secret of praying in the Name of Christ; living in
   the Spirit that fits for praying in the Spirit.  It is abiding in
   Christ that gives the right and power to ask what we will:  the extent
   of the abiding is the exact measure of the power in prayer.  It is the
   Spirit dwelling within us that prays, not in words and thoughts always,
   but in a breathing and a being deeper than utterance.  Just so much as
   there is of Christ's Spirit in us, is there real prayer.  Our lives,
   our lives, O let our lives be full of Christ, and full of His Spirit,
   and the wonderfully unlimited promises to our prayer will no longer
   appear strange.  Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my Name.  Ask, and
   ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.  At that day ye shall ask
   in my Name.  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask
   the father in my Name, He will give it you.'

   LORD , TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O my God!  in holy awe I bow before Thee, the Three in One.  Again I
   have seen how the mystery of prayer is the mystery of the Holy
   Trinity.  I adore the Father who ever hears, and the Son who ever lives
   to pray, and the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son,
   to lift us up into the fellowship of that ever-blessed, never-ceasing
   asking and receiving.  I bow, my God, in adoring worship, before the
   infinite condescension that thus, through the Holy Spirit, takes us and
   our prayers into the Divine Life, and its fellowship of love.

   O my Blessed Lord Jesus!  Teach me to understand Thy lesson, that it is
   the indwelling Spirit, streaming from Thee, uniting to Thee, who is the
   Spirit of prayer.  Teach me what it is as an empty, wholly consecrated
   vessel, to yield myself to His being my life.  Teach me to honour and
   trust Him, as a living Person, to lead my life and my prayer.  Teach me
   specially in prayer to wait in holy silence, and give Him place to
   breathe within me His unutterable intercession.  And teach me that
   through Him it is possible to pray without ceasing, and to pray without
   failing, because He makes me partaker of the never-ceasing and
   never-failing intercession in which Thou, the Son, dost appear before
   the Father.  Yea, Lord, fulfil in me Thy promise, At that day ye shall
   ask in my Name.  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall
   ask the Father in my Name, that will He give.'  Amen.

   NOTE.

   Prayer has often been compared to breathing:  we have only to carry out
   the comparison fully to see how wonderful the place is which the Holy
   Spirit occupies.  With every breath we expel the impure air which would
   soon cause our death, and inhale again the fresh air to which we owe
   our life.  So we give out from us, in confession the sins, in prayer
   the needs and the desires of our heart.  And in drawing in our breath
   again, we inhale the fresh air of the promises, and the love, and the
   life of God in Christ.  We do this through the Holy Spirit, who is the
   breath of our life.

   And this He is because He is the breath of God.  The Father breathes
   Him into us, to unite Himself with our life.  And then just as on every
   expiration there follows again the inhaling or drawing in of the
   breath, so God draws in again His breath, and the Spirit returns to Him
   laden with the desires and needs of our hearts.  And thus the Holy
   Spirit is the breath of the life of God, and the breath of the new life
   in us.  As God breathes Him out, we receive Him in answer to prayer; as
   we breathe Him back again, He rises to God laden with our
   supplications.  As the Spirit of God, in whom the Father and the Son
   are one, and the intercession of the Son reaches the Father, He is to
   us the Spirit of prayer.  True prayer is the living experience of the
   truth of the Holy Trinity.  The Spirit's breathing, the Son's
   intercession, the Father's will, these three become one in us.

TWENTY-SIXTH LESSON.

  I have prayed for thee;'

  Or,    Christ the Intercessor.

   But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.'--Luke xxii. 32.

   I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you.'--John xvi.
   26.

   He ever liveth to make intercession.'--Heb. vii. 25.

   ALL growth in the spiritual life is connected with the clearer insight
   into what Jesus is to us.  The more I realize that Christ must be all
   to me and in me, that all in Christ is indeed for me, the more I learn
   to live the real life of faith, which, dying to self, lives wholly in
   Christ.  The Christian life is no longer the vain struggle to live
   right, but the resting in Christ and finding strength in Him as our
   life, to fight the fight and gain the victory of faith.  This is
   specially true of the life of prayer.  As it too comes under the law of
   faith alone, and is seen in the light of the fulness and completeness
   there is in Jesus, the believer understands that it need no longer be a
   matter of strain or anxious care, but an experience of what Christ will
   do for him and in him--a participation in that life of Christ which, as
   on earth, so in heaven, ever ascends to the Father as prayer.  And he
   begins to pray, not only trusting in the merits of Jesus, or in the
   intercession by which our unworthy prayers are made acceptable, but in
   that near and close union in virtue of which He prays in us and we in
   Him. [3] ^   The whole of salvation is Christ Himself:  He has given
   HIMSELF to us; He Himself lives in us.  Because He prays, we pray too.
   As the disciples, when they saw Jesus pray, asked Him to make them
   partakers of what He knew of prayer, so we, now we see Him as
   intercessor on the throne, know that He makes us participate with
   Himself in the life of prayer.

   How clearly this comes out in the last night of His life.  In His
   high-priestly prayer (John xvii.), He shows us how and what He has to
   pray to the Father, and will pray when once ascended to heaven.  And
   yet He had in His parting address so repeatedly also connected His
   going to the Father with their new life of prayer.  The two would be
   ultimately connected:  His entrance on the work of His eternal
   intercession would be the commencement and the power of their new
   prayer-life in His Name.  It is the sight of Jesus in His intercession
   that gives us power to pray in His Name:  all right and power of prayer
   is Christ's; He makes us share in His intercession.

   To understand this, think first of His intercession:  He ever liveth to
   make intercession.  The work of Christ on earth as Priest was but a
   beginning.  It was as Aaron He shed His blood; it is as Melchizedek
   that He now lives within the veil to continue His work, after the power
   of the eternal life.  As Melchizedek is more glorious than Aaron, so it
   is in the work of intercession that the atonement has its true power
   and glory.  It is Christ that died:  yea more, who is even at the right
   hand of God, who maketh intercession for us.'  That intercession is an
   intense reality, a work that is absolutely necessary, and without which
   the continued application of redemption cannot take place.  In the
   incarnation and resurrection of Jesus the wondrous reconciliation took
   place, by which man became partaker of the Divine life and
   blessedness.  But the real personal appropriation of this
   reconciliation in each of His members here below cannot take place
   without the unceasing exercise of His Divine power by the head in
   heaven.  In all conversion and sanctification, in every victory over
   sin and the world, there is a real forth-putting of the power of Him
   who is mighty to save.  And this exercise of His power only takes place
   through His prayer:  He asks of the Father, and receives from the
   Father.  He is able to save to the uttermost, because He ever liveth to
   make intercession.'  There is not a need of His people but He receives
   in intercession what the Godhead has to give:  His mediation on the
   throne is as real and indispensable as on the cross.  Nothing takes
   place without His intercession:  it engages all His time and powers, is
   His unceasing occupation at the right hand of the Father.

   And we participate not only in the benefits of this His work, but in
   the work itself.  This because we are His body.  Body and members are
   one:  The head cannot say to the feet, I have no need of thee.'  We
   share with Jesus in all He is and has:  The glory which Thou gavest me,
   I have given them.'  We are partakers of His life, His righteousness,
   His work:  we share with Him in His intercession too; it is not a work
   He does without us.

   We do this because we are partakers of His life:  Christ is our life;'
   No longer I, but Christ liveth in me.'  The life in Him and in us is
   identical, one and the same.  His life in us is an ever-praying life.
   When it descends and takes possession of us, it does not lose its
   character; in us too it is the every-praying life--a life that without
   ceasing asks and receives from God.  And this not as if there were two
   separate currents of prayer rising upwards, one from Him, and one from
   His people.  No, but the substantial life-union is also prayer-union:
   what He prays passes through us, what we pray passes through Him.  He
   is the angel with the golden censer:  UNTO HIM there was given much
   incense,' the secret of acceptable prayer, that He should add it unto
   the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar.'  We live, we
   abide in Him, the Interceding One.

   The Only-begotten is the only one who has the right to pray:  to Him
   alone it was said,  Ask, and it shall be given Thee.'  As in all other
   things the fulness dwells in Him, so the true prayer-fulness too; He
   alone has the power of prayer.  And just as the growth of the spiritual
   life consists in the clearer insight that all the treasures are in Him,
   and that we too are in Him, to receive each moment what we possess in
   Him, grace for grace, so with the prayer-life too.  Our faith in the
   intercession of Jesus must not only be that He prays in our stead, when
   we do not or cannot pray, but that, as the Author of our life and our
   faith, He draws us on to pray in unison with Himself.  Our prayer must
   be a work of faith in this sense too, that as we know that Jesus
   communicates His whole life in us, He also out of that prayerfulness
   which is His alone breathes into us our praying.

   To many a believer it was a new epoch in his spiritual life when it was
   revealed to him how truly and entirely Christ was his life, standing
   good as surety for his remaining faithful and obedient.  It was then
   first that he really began to life a faith-life.  No less blessed will
   be the discovery that Christ is surety for our prayer-life too, the
   centre and embodiment of all prayer, to be communicated by Him through
   the Holy Spirit to His people.  He ever liveth to make intercession' as
   the Head of the body, as the Leader in that new and living way which He
   hath opened up, as the Author and the Perfecter of our faith.  He
   provides in everything for the life of His redeemed ones by giving His
   own life in them:  He cares for their life of prayer, by taking them up
   into His heavenly prayer-life, by giving and maintaining His
   prayer-life within them.  I have prayed for thee,' not to render thy
   faith needless, but that thy faith fail not:' our faith and prayer of
   faith is rooted in His.  It is, if ye abide in me,' the ever-living
   Intercessor, and pray with me and in me:  ask whatsoever ye will, and
   it shall be done unto you.'

   The thought of our fellowship in the intercession of Jesus reminds us
   of what He has taught us more than once before, how all these wonderful
   prayer-promises have as their aim and their justification, the glory of
   God in the manifestation of His kingdom and the salvation of sinners.
   As long as we only or chiefly pray for ourselves, the promises of the
   last night must remain a sealed book to us.  It is to the fruit-bearing
   branches of the Vine; it is to disciples sent into the world as the
   Father sent Him, to live for perishing men; it is to His faithful
   servants and intimate friends who take up the work He leaves behind,
   who have like their Lord become as the seed-corn, losing its life to
   multiply it manifold;--it is to such that the promises are given.  Let
   us each find out what the work is, and who the souls are entrusted to
   our special prayers; let us make our intercession for them our life of
   fellowship with God, and we shall not only find the promises of power
   in prayer made true to us, but we shall then first begin to realize how
   our abiding in Christ and His abiding in us makes us share in His own
   joy of blessing and saving men.

   O most wonderful intercession of our Blessed Lord Jesus, to which we
   not only owe everything, but in which we are taken up as active
   partners and fellow-workers!  Now we understand what it is to pray in
   the Name of Jesus, and why it has such power.  In His Name, in His
   Spirit, in Himself, in perfect union with Him.  O wondrous, ever
   active, and most efficacious intercession of the man Christ Jesus!
   When shall we be wholly taken up into it and always pray in it?

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord!  In lowly adoration I would again bow before Thee.  Thy
   whole redemption work has now passed into prayer; all that now occupies
   Thee in maintaining and dispensing what Thou didst purchase with Thy
   blood is only prayer.  Thou ever livest to pray.  And because we are
   and abide in Thee, the direct access to the Father is always open, our
   life can be one of unceasing prayer, and the answer to our prayer is
   sure.

   Blessed Lord!  Thou hast invited Thy people to be Thy fellow-workers in
   a life of prayer.  Thou hast united Thyself with Thy people and makest
   them as Thy body share with Thee in that ministry of intercession
   through which alone the world can be filled with the fruit of Thy
   redemption and the glory of the Father.  With more liberty than ever I
   come to Thee, my Lord, and beseech Thee:  Teach me to pray.  Thy life
   is prayer, Thy life is mine.  Lord!  teach me to pray, in Thee, like
   Thee.

   And, O my Lord!  Give me specially to know, as Thou didst promise Thy
   disciples, that Thou art in the Father, and I in Thee, and Thou in me.
   Let the uniting power of the Holy Spirit make my whole life an abiding
   in Thee and Thy intercession, so that my prayer may be its echo, and
   the Father hear me in Thee and Thee in me.  Lord Jesus!  let Thy mind
   in everything be in me, and my life in everything by in Thee.  So shall
   I be prepared to be the channel through which Thy intercession pours
   its blessing on the world.  Amen.

   NOTE.

   The new epoch of prayer in the Name of Jesus is pointed out by Christ
   as the time of the outpouring of the Spirit, in which the disciples
   enter upon a more enlightened apprehension of the economy of
   redemption, and become as clearly conscious of their oneness with Jesus
   as of His oneness with the Father.  Their prayer in the Name of Jesus
   is now directly to the Father Himself.  "I say not that I will pray
   for you, for the Father Himself loveth you,"  Jesus says; while He had
   previously spoken of the time before the Spirit's coming:  "I will pray
   the Father, and He will give you the Comforter."  This prayer thus has
   as its central thought the insight into our being united to God in
   Christ as on both sides the living bond of union between God and us
   (John xvii. 23: "I in them and Thou in me"), so that in Jesus we behold
   the Father as united to us, and ourselves as united to the Father.
   Jesus Christ must have been revealed to us, not only through the truth
   in the mind, but in our inmost personal consciousness as the living
   personal reconciliation, as He in whom God's Fatherhood and Father-love
   have been perfectly united with human nature and it with God.  Not that
   with the immediate prayer to the Father, the mediatorship of Christ is
   set aside; but it is no longer looked at as something external,
   existing outside of us, but as a real living spiritual existence within
   us, so that the Christ for us, the Mediator, has really become Christ
   in us.

   When the consciousness of this oneness between God in Christ and us in
   Christ still is wanting, or has been darkened by the sense of guilt,
   then the prayer of faith looks to our Lord as the Advocate, who pays
   the Father for us.  (Compare John xvi. 26 with John xiv. 16, 17; ix.
   20; Luke xxi. 32; I John ii. 1.) To take Christ thus in prayer as
   Advocate, is according to John xvi. 26 not perfectly the same as the
   prayer in His Name. Christ's advocacy is meant to lead us on to that
   inner self-standing life-union with Him, and with the Father in Him, in
   virtue of which Christ is He in whom God enters into immediate relation
   and unites Himself with us, and in whom we in all circumstances enter
   into immediate relation with God.  Even so the prayer in the Name of
   Jesus does not consist in our prayer at His command:  the disciples had
   prayed thus ever since the Lord had given them His "Our Father," and
   yet He says, "Hitherto ye have not prayed in my Name."  Only when the
   mediation of Christ has become, through the indwelling of the Holy
   Spirit, life and power within us, and so His mind, as it found
   expression in His word and work, has taken possession of and filled our
   personal consciousness and will, so that in faith and love we have
   Jesus in us as the Reconciler who has actually made us one with God:
   only then His Name, which included His nature and His work, is become
   truth and power in us (not only for us), and we have in the Name of
   Jesus the free, direct access to the Father which is sure of being
   heard.  Prayer in the Name of Jesus is the liberty of a son with the
   Father, just as Jesus had this as the First-begotten.  We pray in the
   place of Jesus, not as if we could put ourselves in His place, but in
   as far as we are in Him and He in us.   We go direct to the Father, but
   only as the Father is in Christ, not as if He were separate from
   Christ.  Wherever thus the inner man does not live in Christ and has
   Him not present as the Living One, where His word is not ruling in the
   heart in its Spirit-power, where His truth and life have not become the
   life of our soul, it is vain to think that a formula like "for the sake
   of Thy dear Son" will avail.'--Christliche Ethik, von Dr. I. T. Beck,
   Tubingen, iii. 39.

   union with Him, so that we ourselves can come directly to the Father in
   His Name,--the note above from Beck of Tubingen.

TWENTY-SEVENTH LESSON.

  Father, I will;'

  Or,    Christ the High Priest

   Father, I will that they also whom Thou hast given me may be with me
   where I am.'--John xvii. 24.

   IN His parting address, Jesus gives His disciples the full revelation
   of what the New Life was to be, when once the kingdom of God had come
   in power.  In the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, in union with Him the
   heavenly Vine, in their going forth to witness and to suffer for Him,
   they were to find their calling and their blessedness.  In between His
   setting forth of their future new life, the Lord had repeatedly given
   the most unlimited promises as to the power their prayers might have.
   And now in closing, He Himself proceeds to pray.  To let His disciples
   have the joy of knowing what His intercession for them in heaven as
   their High Priest will be, He gives this precious legacy of His prayer
   to the Father.  He does this at the same time because they as priests
   are to share in His work of intercession, that they and we might know
   how to perform this holy work.  In the teaching of our Lord on this
   last night, we have learned to understand that these astonishing
   prayer-promises have not been given in our own behalf, but in the
   interest of the Lord and His kingdom:  it is from the Lord Himself
   alone that we can learn what the prayer in His Name is to be and to
   obtain.  We have understood that to pray in His Name is to pray in
   perfect unity with Himself:  the high-priestly prayer will teach all
   that the prayer in the Name of Jesus may ask and expect.

   This prayer is ordinarily divided into three parts.  Our Lord first
   prays for Himself (v. 1-5), then for His disciples (6-19), and last for
   all the believing people through all ages (20-26).  The follower of
   Jesus, who gives himself to the work of intercession, and would fain
   try how much of blessing he can pray down upon his circle in the Name
   of Jesus, will in all humility let himself be led of the Spirit to
   study this wonderful prayer as one of the most important lessons of the
   school of prayer.

   First of all, Jesus prays for Himself, for His being glorified, that so
   He may glorify the Father.  Father! Glorify Thy Son.  And now, Father,
   glorify me.'  And He brings forward the grounds on which He thus
   prays.  A holy covenant had been concluded between the Father and the
   Son in heaven.  The Father had promised Him power over all flesh as the
   reward of His work:  He had done the work, He had glorified the Father,
   and His one purpose is now still further to glorify Him.  With the
   utmost boldness He asks that the Father may glorify Him, that He may
   now be and do for His people all He has undertaken.

   Disciple of Jesus!  here you have the first lesson in your work of
   priestly intercession, to be learned from the example of your great
   High Priest.  To pray in the Name of Jesus is to pray in unity, in
   sympathy with Him.  As the Son began His prayer by making clear His
   relation to the Father, pleading His work and obedience and His desire
   to see the Father glorified, do so too.  Draw near and appear before
   the Father in Christ.  Plead His finished work.  Say that you are one
   with it, that you trust on it, live in it.  Say that you too have given
   yourself to finish the work the Father has given you to do, and to live
   alone for His glory.  And ask then confidently that the Son may be
   glorified in you.  This is praying in the Name, in the very words, in
   the Spirit of Jesus, in union with Jesus Himself.  Such prayer has
   power.  If with Jesus you glorify the Father, the Father will glorify
   Jesus by doing what you ask in His Name.  It is only when your own
   personal relation on this point, like Christ's, is clear with God, when
   you are glorifying Him, and seeking all for His glory, that like
   Christ, you will have power to intercede for those around you.

   Our Lord next prays for the circle of His disciples.  He speaks of them
   as those whom the Father has given Him.  Their chief mark is that they
   have received Christ's word.  He says of them that He now sends them
   into the world in His place, just as the Father had sent Himself.  And
   He asks two things for them:  that the Father keep them from the evil
   one, and sanctify them through His Word, because He sanctifies Himself
   for them.

   Just like the Lord, each believing intercessor has his own immediate
   circle for whom he first prays.  Parents have their children, teachers
   their pupils, pastors their flocks, all workers their special charge,
   all believers those whose care lies upon their hearts.  It is of great
   consequence that intercession should be personal, pointed, and
   definite.  And then our first prayer must always be that they may
   receive the word.  But this prayer will not avail unless with our Lord
   we say, I have given them Thy word:' it is this gives us liberty and
   power in intercession for souls.  Not only pray for them, but speak to
   them.  And when they have received the word, let us pray much for their
   being kept from the evil one, for their being sanctified through that
   word.  Instead of being hopeless or judging or giving up those who
   fall, let us pray for our circle, Father!  Keep them in Thy Name;'
   Sanctify them through Thy truth.'  Prayer in the Name of Jesus availeth
   much:  What ye will shall be done unto you.'

   And then follows our Lord's prayer for a still wider circle.  I pray
   not only for these, but for them who through their word shall
   believe.'  His priestly heart enlarges itself to embrace all places and
   all time, and He prays that all who belong to Him may everywhere be
   one, as God's proof to the world of the divinity of His mission, and
   then that they may ever be with Him in His glory.  Until then that the
   love wherewith Thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.'

   The disciple of Jesus, who has first in his own circle proved the power
   of prayer, cannot confine himself within its limits:   he prays for the
   Church universal and its different branches.  He prays specially for
   the unity of the Spirit and of love.  He prays for its being one in
   Christ, as a witness to the world that Christ, who hath wrought such a
   wonder as to make love triumph over selfishness and separation, is
   indeed the Son of God sent from heaven.  Every believer ought to pray
   much that the unity of the Church, not in external organizations, but
   in spirit and in truth, may be made manifest.

   So much for the matter of the prayer.  Now for its mode.  Jesus says,
   FATHER!  I WILL.'  On the ground of His right as Son, and the Father's
   promise to Him, and His finished work, He might do so.  The Father had
   said to Him, Ask of me, and I will give Thee.'  He simply availed
   Himself of the Father's promise.  Jesus has given us a like promise:
   Whatsoever ye will shall be done unto you.'  He asks me in His Name to
   say what I will.  Abiding in Him, in a living union with Him in which
   man is nothing and Christ all, the believer has the liberty to take up
   that word of His High Priest and, in answer to the question What wilt
   thou?' to say, FATHER!  I WILLall that Thou hast promised.'  This is
   nothing but true faith; this is honouring God:  to be assured that such
   confidence in saying what I will is indeed acceptable to Him.  At first
   sight, our heart shrinks from the expression; we feel neither the
   liberty nor the power to speak thus.  It is a word for which alone in
   the most entire abnegation of our will grace will be given, but for
   which grace will most assuredly be given to each one who loses his will
   in his Lord's.  He that loseth his will shall find it; he that gives up
   his will entirely shall find it again renewed and strengthened with a
   Divine Strength.  FATHER!  I WILL:'  this is the keynote of the
   everlasting, ever-active, all-prevailing intercession of our Lord in
   heaven.  It is only in union with Him that our prayer avails; in union
   with Him it avails much.  If we but abide in Him, living, and walking,
   and doing all things in His Name; if we but come and bring each
   separate petition, tested and touched by His Word and Spirit, and cast
   it into the mighty stream of intercession that goes up from Him, to be
   borne upward and presented before the Father;--we shall have the full
   confidence that we receive the petitions we ask:  the Father!  I will'
   will be breathed into us by the Spirit Himself.  We shall lose
   ourselves in Him, and become nothing, to find that in our impotence we
   have power and prevail.

   Disciples of Jesus!  Called to be like your Lord in His priestly
   intercession, when, O when!  Shall we awaken to the glory, passing all
   conception, of this our destiny to plead and prevail with God for
   perishing men?  O when shall we shake off the sloth that clothes itself
   with the pretence of humility, and yield ourselves wholly to God's
   Spirit, that He may fill our wills with light and with power, to know,
   and to take, and to possess all that our God is waiting to give to a
   will that lays hold on Him.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O my Blessed High Priest!  who am I that Thou shouldest thus invite me
   to share with Thee in Thy power of prevailing intercession!  And why, O
   my Lord!  am I so slow of heart to understand and believe and exercise
   this wonderful privilege to which Thou hast redeemed Thy people.  O
   Lord!  give Thy grace that this may increasingly be my unceasing
   life-work--in praying without ceasing to draw down the blessing of
   heaven on all my surroundings on earth.

   Blessed Lord!  I come now to accept this my calling.  For this I would
   forsake all and follow Thee.  Into Thy hands I would believingly yield
   my whole being:  form, train, inspire me to be one of Thy
   prayer-legion, wrestlers who watch and strive in prayer, Israels, God's
   princes, who have power and prevail.  Take possession of my heart, and
   fill it with the one desire for the glory of God in the ingathering,
   and sanctification, and union of those whom the Father hath given
   Thee.  Take my mind and let this be my study and my wisdom, to know
   when prayer can bring a blessing.  Take me wholly and fit me as a
   priest ever to stand before God and to bless in His Name.

   Blessed Lord!  Be it here, as through all the spiritual life:  Thou
   all, I nothing.  And be it here my experience too that he that has and
   seeks nothing for himself, receives all, even to the wonderful grace of
   sharing with Thee in Thine everlasting ministry of intercession.  Amen.

TWENTY-EIGHTH LESSON.

  Father!  Not what I will;'

  Or,    Christ the Sacrifice.

   And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee; remove
   this cup from me:  howbeit not what I will, but what Thou wilt.'--Mark
   xiv. 36.

   WHAT a contrast within the space of a few hours!  What a transition
   from the quiet elevation of that, He lifted up His eyes to heaven, and
   said, FATHER I WILL,' to that falling on the ground and crying in
   agony. My Father! Not what I will.'  In the one we see the High Priest
   within the veil in His all-prevailing intercession; in the other, the
   sacrifice on the altar opening the way through the rent veil.  The
   high-priestly Father!  I will,' in order of time precedes the
   sacrificial Father!  Not what I will;' but this was only by
   anticipation, to show what the intercession would be when once the
   sacrifice was brought.  In reality it was that prayer at the altar,
   Father!  Not what I will,' in which the prayer before the throne,
   Father!  I will,' had its origin and its power.  It is from the entire
   surrender of His will in Gethsemane that the High Priest on the throne
   has the power to ask what He will, has the right to make His people
   share in that power too, and ask what they will.

   For all who would learn to pray in the school of Jesus, this Gethsemane
   lesson is one of the most sacred and precious.  To a superficial
   scholar it may appear to take away the courage to pray in faith.  If
   even the earnest supplication of the Son was not heard, if even the
   Beloved had to say, NOT WHAT I WILL!' how much more do we need to speak
   so.  And thus it appears impossible that the promises which the Lord
   had given only a few hours previously, WHATSOEVER YE SHALL ASK,'
   WHATSOEVER YE WILL,' could have been meant literally.  A deeper insight
   into the meaning of Gethsemane would teach us that we have just here
   the sure ground and the open way to the assurance of an answer to our
   prayer.  Let us draw nigh in reverent and adoring wonder, to gaze on
   this great sight--God's Son thus offering up prayer and supplications
   with strong crying and tears, and not obtaining what He asks.  He
   Himself is our Teacher, and will open up to us the mystery of His holy
   sacrifice, as revealed in this wondrous prayer.

   To understand the prayer, let us note the infinite difference between
   what our Lord prayed a little ago as a Royal High Priest, and what He
   here supplicates in His weakness.  There it was for the glorifying of
   the Father He prayed, and the glorifying of Himself and His people as
   the fulfilment of distinct promises that had been given Him.  He asked
   what He knew to be according to the word and the will of the Father; He
   might boldly say, FATHER!  I WILL.'  Here He prays for something in
   regard to which the Father's will is not yet clear to Him.  As far as
   He knows, it is the Father's will that He should drink the cup.  He had
   told His disciples of the cup He must drink:  a little later He would
   again say, The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink
   it?'  It was for this He had come to this earth.  But when, in the
   unutterable agony of soul that burst upon him as the power of darkness
   came upon Him, and He began to taste the first drops of death as the
   wrath of God against sin, His human nature, as it shuddered in presence
   of the awful reality of being made a curse, gave utterance in this cry
   of anguish, to its desire that, if God's purpose could be accomplished
   without it, He might be spared the awful cup:  Let this cup pass from
   me.'  That desire was the evidence of the intense reality of His
   humanity.  The Not as I will' kept that desire from being sinful:  as
   He pleadingly cries, All things are possible with Thee,' and returns
   again to still more earnest prayer that the cup may be removed, it is
   His thrice-repeated NOT WHAT I WILL' that constitutes the very essence
   and worth of His sacrifice.  He had asked for something of which He
   could not say:  I know it is Thy will.  He had pleaded God's power and
   love, and had then withdrawn it in His final, THY WILL BE DONE.'  The
   prayer that the cup should pass away could not be answered; the prayer
   of submission that God's will be done was heard, and gloriously
   answered in His victory first over the fear, and then over the power of
   death.

   It is in this denial of His will, this complete surrender of His will
   to the will of the Father, that Christ's obedience reached its highest
   perfection.  It is from the sacrifice of the will in Gethsemane that
   the sacrifice of the life on Calvary derives its value.  It is here, as
   Scripture saith, that He learned obedience, and became the author of
   everlasting salvation to all that obey Him.  It was because He there,
   in that prayer, became obedient unto death, even the death of the
   cross, that God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him the power to ask
   what He will.  It was in that Father!  Not what I will,' that He
   obtained the power for that other FATHER!  I will.'  It was by Christ's
   submittal in Gethsemane to have not His will done, that He secured for
   His people the right to say to them, Ask whatsoever ye will.'

   Let me look at them again, the deep mysteries that Gethsemane offers to
   my view.  There is the first:  the Father offers His Well-beloved the
   cup, the cup of wrath.  The second:  the Son, always so obedient,
   shrinks back, and implores that He may not have to drink it.  The
   third:  the Father does not grant the Son His request, but still gives
   the cup.  And then the last:  the Son yields His will, is content that
   His will be not done, and goes out to Calvary to drink the cup.  O
   Gethsemane!  in thee I see how my Lord could give me such unlimited
   assurance of an answer to my prayers.  As my surety He won it for me,
   by His consent to have His petition unanswered.

   This is in harmony with the whole scheme of redemption.  Our Lord
   always wins for us the opposite of what He suffered.  He was bound that
   we might go free.  He was made sin that we might become the
   righteousness of God.  He died that we might live.  He bore God's curse
   that God's blessing might be ours.  He endured the not answering of His
   prayer, that our prayers might find an answer.  Yea, He spake, Not as I
   will,' that He might say to us, If ye abide in me, ask what ye will; it
   shall be done unto you.'

   Yes, If ye abide in me;' here in Gethsemane the word acquires new force
   and depth.  Christ is our Head, who as surety stands in our place, and
   bears what we must for ever have borne.  We had deserved that God
   should turn a deaf ear to us, and never listen to our cry.  Christ
   comes, and suffers this too for us:  He suffers what we had merited;
   for our sins He suffers beneath the burden of that unanswered prayer.
   But now His suffering this avails for me:  what He has borne is taken
   away for me; His merit has won for me the answer to every prayer, if I
   abide in Him.

   Yes, in Him, as He bows there in Gethsemane, I must abide.  As my Head,
   He not only once suffered for me, but ever lives in me, breathing and
   working His own disposition in me too.  The Eternal Spirit, through
   which He offered Himself unto God, is the Spirit that dwells in me too,
   and makes me partaker of the very same obedience, and the sacrifice of
   the will unto God.  That Spirit teaches me to yield my will entirely to
   the will of the Father, to give it up even unto the death, in Christ to
   be dead to it.  Whatever is my own mind and thought and will, even
   though it be not directly sinful, He teaches me to fear and flee.  He
   opens my ear to wait in great gentleness and teachableness of soul for
   what the Father has day by day to speak and to teach.  He discovers to
   me how union with God's will in the love of it is union with God
   Himself; how entire surrender to God's will is the Father's claim, the
   Son's example, and the true blessedness of the soul.  He leads my will
   into the fellowship of Christ's death and resurrection, my will dies in
   Him, in Him to be made alive again.  He breathes into it, as a renewed
   and quickened will, a holy insight into God's perfect will, a holy joy
   in yielding itself to be an instrument of that will, a holy liberty and
   power to lay hold of God's will to answer prayer.  With my whole will I
   learn to live for the interests of God and His kingdom, to exercise the
   power of that will--crucified but risen again--in nature and in prayer,
   on earth and in heaven, with men and with God.  The more deeply I enter
   into the FATHER! NOT WHAT I WILL' of Gethsemane, and into Him who spake
   it, to abide in Him, the fuller is my spiritual access into the power
   of His FATHER! I WILL.  And the soul experiences that it is the will,
   which has become nothing that God's will may be all, which now becomes
   inspired with a Divine strength to really will what God wills, and to
   claim what has been promised it in the name of Christ.

   O let us listen to Christ in Gethsemane, as He calls, If ye abide in
   me, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.'  Being of
   one mind and spirit with Him in His giving up everything to God's will,
   living like Him in obedience and surrender to the Father; this is
   abiding in Him; this is the secret of power in prayer.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Lord Jesus!  Gethsemane was Thy school, where Thou didst learn
   to pray and to obey.  It is still Thy school, where Thou leadest all
   Thy disciples who would fain learn to obey and to pray even as Thou.
   Lord! teach me there to pray, in the faith that Thou has atoned for and
   conquered our self-will, and canst indeed give us grace to pray like
   Thee.

   O Lamb of God!  I would follow Thee to Gethsemane, there to become one
   with Thee, and to abide in Thee as Thou dost unto the very death yield
   Thy will unto the Father.  With Thee, through Thee, in Thee, I do yield
   my will in absolute and entire surrender to the will of the Father.
   Conscious of my own weakness, and the secret power with which self-will
   would assert itself and again take its place on the throne, I claim in
   faith the power of Thy victory.  Thou didst triumph over it and deliver
   me from it.  In Thy death I would daily live;  in Thy life I would
   daily die.  Abiding in Thee, let my will, through the power of Thine
   eternal Spirit, only be the tuned instrument which yields to every
   touch of the will of my God.  With my whole soul do I say with Thee and
   in Thee, Father!  Not as I will, but as Thou wilt.'

   And then, Blessed Lord!  Open my heart and that of all Thy people, to
   take in fully the glory of the truth, that a will given up to God is a
   will accepted of God to be used in his service, to desire, and purpose,
   and determine, and will what is according to God's will.  A will which,
   in the power of the Holy Spirit the indwelling God, is to exercise its
   royal prerogative in prayer, to loose and to bind in heaven and upon
   earth, to ask whatsoever it will, and to say it shall be done.

   O Lord Jesus!  teach me to pray.  Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

TWENTY-NINTH LESSON.

  According to His will;

  Or,    Our Boldness in Prayer.

   And this is the boldness which we have toward Him, that, if we ask
   anything according to His will, He heareth us.  And if we know that He
   hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we
   have asked of Him.'--I John V v. 14-15.

   ONE of the greatest hindrances to believing prayer is with many
   undoubtedly this:  they know not if what they ask is according to the
   will of God.  As long as they are in doubt on this point, they cannot
   have the boldness to ask in the assurance that they certainly shall
   receive.  And they soon begin to think that, if once they have made
   known their requests, and receive no answer, it is best to leave it to
   God to do according to His good pleasure.  The words of John, If we ask
   anything according to His will, He heareth us,' as they understand
   them, make certainty as to answer to prayer impossible, because they
   cannot be sure of what really may be the will of God.  They think of
   God's will as His hidden counsel--how should man be able to fathom what
   really may be the purpose of the all-wise God.

   This is the very opposite of what John aimed at in writing thus.  He
   wished to rouse us to boldness, to confidence, to full assurance of
   faith in prayer.  He says, This is the boldness which we have toward
   Him,' that we can say:  Father!  Thou knowest and I know that I ask
   according to Thy will:  I know Thou hearest me.  This is the boldness,
   that if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us.'  On this
   account He adds at once:  If we know that He heareth us whatsoever we
   ask, we know,' through this faith, that we have,' that we now while we
   pray receive the petition,' the special things, we have asked of Him.'
   John supposes that when we pray, we first find out if our prayers are
   according to the will of God.  They may be according to God's will, and
   yet not come at once, or without the persevering prayer of faith.  It
   is to give us courage thus to persevere and to be strong in faith, that
   He tells us:  This gives us boldness or confidence in prayer, if we ask
   anything according to His will, He heareth us.  It is evident that if
   it be a matter of uncertainty to us whether our petitions be according
   to His will, we cannot have the comfort of what he says, We know that
   we have the petitions which we have asked of Him.'

   But just this is the difficulty.  More than one believer says:  I do
   not know if what I desire be according to the will of God.  God's will
   is the purpose of His infinite wisdom:  it is impossible for me to know
   whether He may not count something else better for me than what I
   desire, or may not have some reasons for withholding what I ask.'
   Every one feels how with such thoughts the prayer of faith, of which
   Jesus said, Whosoever shall believe that these things which he saith
   shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith,' becomes an
   impossibility.  There may be the prayer of submission, and of trust in
   God's wisdom; there cannot be the prayer of faith.  The great mistake
   here is that God's children do not really believe that it is possible
   to know God's will.  Or if they believe this, they do not take the time
   and trouble to find it out.  What we need is to see clearly in what way
   it is that the Father leads His waiting, teachable child to know that
   his petition is according to His will.^1  It is through God's holy
   word, taken up and kept in the heart, the life, the will; and through
   God's Holy Spirit, accepted in His indwelling and leading, that we
   shall learn to know that our petitions are according to His will.

   Through the word.  There is a secret will of God, with which we often
   fear that our prayers may be at variance.  It is not with this will of
   God, but His will as revealed in His word, that we have to do in
   prayer.  Our notions of what the secret will may have decreed, and of
   how it might render the answers to our prayers impossible, are mostly
   very erroneous.  Childlike faith as to what He is willing to do for His
   children, simply keeps to the Father's assurance, that it is His will
   to hear prayer and to do what faith in His word desires and accepts.
   In the word the Father has revealed in general promises the great
   principles of His will with His people.  The child has to take the
   promise and apply it to the special circumstances in His life to which
   it has reference.  Whatever he asks within the limits of that revealed
   will, he can know to be according to the will of God, and he may
   confidently expect.  In His word, God has given us the revelation of
   His will and plans with us, with His people, and with the world, with
   the most precious promises of the grace and power with which through
   His people He will carry out His plans and do His work.  As faith
   becomes strong and bold enough to claim the fulfilment of the general
   promise in the special case, we may have the assurance that our prayers
   are heard:  they are according to God's will.  Take the words of John
   in the verse following our text as an illustration:  If any man see his
   brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask and God will give
   him life.'  Such is the general promise; and the believer who pleads on
   the ground of this promise, prays according to the will of God, and
   John would give him boldness to know that he has the petition which he
   asks.

   But this apprehension of God's will is something spiritual, and must be
   spiritually discerned.  It is not as a matter of logic that we can
   argue it out:  God has said it; I must have it.  Nor has every
   Christian the same gift or calling.  While the general will revealed in
   the promise is the same for all, there is for each one a special
   different will according to God's purpose.  And herein is the wisdom of
   the saints, to know this special will of God for each of us, according
   to the measure of grace given us, and so to ask in prayer just what God
   has prepared and made possible for each.  It is to communicate this
   wisdom that the Holy Ghost dwells in us.  The personal application of
   the general promises of the word to our special personal needs--it is
   for this that the leading of the Holy Spirit is given us.

   It is this union of the teaching of the word and Spirit that many do
   not understand, and so there is a twofold difficulty in knowing what
   God's will may be.  Some seek the will of God in an inner feeling or
   conviction, and would have the Spirit lead them without the word.
   Others seek it in the word, without the living leading of the Holy
   Spirit.  The two must be united:  only in the word, only in the Spirit,
   but in these most surely, can we know the will of God, and learn to
   pray according to it.  In the heart the word and the Spirit must meet:
   it is only by indwelling that we can experience their teaching.  The
   word must dwell, must abide in us:  heart and life must day by day be
   under its influence.  Not from without, but from within, comes the
   quickening of the word by the Spirit.  It is only he who yields himself
   entirely in his whole life to the supremacy of the word and the will of
   God, who can expect in special cases to discern what that word and will
   permit him boldly to ask.  And even as with the word, just so with the
   Spirit:  if I would have the leading of the Spirit in prayer to assure
   me what God's will is, my whole life must be yielded to that leading;
   so only can mind and heart become spiritual and capable of knowing
   God's holy will.  It is he who, through word and Spirit, lives in the
   will of God by doing it, who will know to pray according to that will
   in the confidence that He hears us.

   Would that Christians might see what incalculable harm they do
   themselves by the thought that because possibly their prayer is not
   according to God's will, they must be content without an answer.  God's
   word tells us that the great reason of unanswered prayer is that we do
   not pray aright:  Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss.'  In
   not granting an answer, the Father tells us that there is something
   wrong in our praying.  He wants to teach us to find it out and confess
   it, and so to educate us to true believing and prevailing prayer.  He
   can only attain His object when He brings us to see that we are to
   blame for the withholding of the answer; our aim, or our faith, or our
   life is not what it should be.  But this purpose of God is frustrated
   as long as we are content to say:  It is perhaps because my prayer is
   not according to His will that He does not hear me.  O let us no longer
   throw the blame of our unanswered prayers on the secret will of God,
   but on our praying amiss.  Let that word, Ye receive not because ye ask
   amiss,' be as the lantern of the Lord, searching heart and life to
   prove that we are indeed such as those to whom Christ gave His promises
   of certain answers.  Let us believe that we can know if our prayer be
   according to God's will.  Let us yield our heart to have the word of
   the Father dwell richly there, to have Christ's word abiding in us.
   Let us live day by day with the anointing which teacheth us all
   things.  Let us yield ourselves unreservedly to the Holy Spirit as He
   teaches us to abide in Christ, to dwell in the Father's presence, and
   we shall soon understand how the Father's love longs that the child
   should know His will, and should, in the confidence that that will
   includes all that His power and love have promised to do, know too that
   He hears the petitions which we ask of Him.  This is the boldness which
   we have, that if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us.'

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   Blessed Master!  With my whole heart I thank Thee for this blessed
   lesson, that the path to a life full of answers to prayer is through
   the will of God.  Lord!  Teach me to know this blessed will by living
   it, loving it, and always doing it.  So shall I learn to offer prayers
   according to that will, and to find in their harmony with God's blessed
   will, my boldness in prayer and my confidence in accepting the answer.

   Father!  it is Thy will that Thy child should enjoy Thy presence and
   blessing.  It is Thy will that everything in the life of Thy child
   should be in accordance with Thy will, and that the Holy Spirit should
   work this in Him.  It is Thy will that Thy child should live in the
   daily experience of distinct answers to prayer, so as to enjoy living
   and direct fellowship with Thyself.  It is Thy will that Thy Name
   should be glorified in and through Thy children, and that it will be in
   those who trust Thee.   O my Father!  let this Thy will be my
   confidence in all I ask.

   Blessed Saviour!  Teach me to believe in the glory of this will.  That
   will is the eternal love, which with Divine power works out its purpose
   in each human will that yields itself to it.  Lord!  Teach me this.
   Thou canst make me see how every promise and every command of the word
   is indeed the will of God, and that its fulfilment is secured to me by
   God Himself.   Let thus the will of God become to me the sure rock on
   which my prayer and my assurance of an answer ever rest.  Amen.

   NOTE.

   There is often great confusion as to the will of God.  People think
   that what God wills must inevitably take place.  This is by no means
   the case.  God wills a great deal of blessing to His people, which
   never comes to them.  He wills it most earnestly, but they do not will
   it, and it cannot come to them.  This is the great mystery of man's
   creation with a free will, and also of the renewal of his will in
   redemption, that God has made the execution of His will, in many
   things, dependent on the will of man.  Of God's will revealed in His
   promises, so much will be fulfilled as our faith accepts.  Prayer is
   the power by which that comes to pass which otherwise would not take
   place.  And faith, the power by which it is decided how much of God's
   will shall be done in us.  When once God reveals to a soul what He is
   willing to do for it, the responsibility for the execution of that will
   rests with us.

   Some are afraid that this is putting too much power into the hands of
   man.  But all power is put into the hands of man in Christ Jesus.  The
   key of all prayer and all power is His, and when we learn to understand
   that He is just as much with us as with the Father, and that we are
   also just as much one with Him as He with the Father, we shall see how
   natural and right and safe it is that to those who abide in Him as He
   in the Father, such power should be given.   It is Christ the Son who
   has the right to ask what He will:  it is through the abiding in Him
   and His abiding in us (in a Divine reality of which we have too little
   apprehension) that His Spirit breathes in us what He wants to ask and
   obtain through us.  We pray in His Name:  the prayers are really ours
   and as really His.

   Others again fear that to believe that prayer has such power is
   limiting the liberty and the love of God.  O if we only knew how we are
   limiting His liberty and His love by not allowing Him to act in the
   only way in which He chooses to act, now that He has taken us up into
   fellowship with himself--through our prayers and our faith.  A brother
   in the ministry once asked, as we were speaking on this subject,
   whether there was not a danger of our thinking that our love to souls
   and our willingness to see them blessed were to move God's love and
   God's willingness to bless them.  We were just passing some large
   water-pipes, by which water was being carried over hill and dale from a
   large mountain stream to a town at some distance.  Just look at these
   pipes, was the answer; they did not make the water willing to flow
   downwards from the hills, nor did they give it its power of blessing
   and refreshment:  this is its very nature.  All that they could do is
   to decide its direction:  by it the inhabitants of the town said they
   want the blessing there.  And just so, it is the very nature of God to
   love and to bless.  Downward and ever downward His love longs to come
   with its quickening and refreshing streams.  But He has left it to
   prayer to say where the blessing is to come.  He has committed it to
   His believing people to bring the living water to the desert places:
   the will of God to bless is dependent upon the will of man to say where
   the blessing must descend.  Such honour have His saints.'  And this is
   the boldness which we have toward him, that if we ask anything
   according to His will, He heareth us.  And if we know that He hear us,
   whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have
   asked of Him.'

THIRTIETH LESSON.

  An holy priesthood;'

  Or,    The Ministry of Intercession.

   An holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
   by Jesus Christ.'--I Peter ii. 5.

   Ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord.'--Isaiah lxi. 6.

   THE Spirit of the Lord God is upon me:  because the Lord hath anointed
   me.'  These are the words of Jesus in Isaiah.  As the fruit of His work
   all redeemed ones are priests, fellow-partakers with Him of His
   anointing with the Spirit as High Priest.  Like the precious ointment
   upon the beard of Aaron, that went down to the skirts of his
   garments.'  As every son of Aaron, so every member of Jesus' body has a
   right to the priesthood.  But not every one exercises it:  many are
   still entirely ignorant of it.  And yet it is the highest privilege of
   a child of God, the mark of greatest nearness and likeness to Him, who
   ever liveth to pray.'  Do you doubt if this really be so?  Think of
   what constitutes priesthood.  There is, first, the work of the
   priesthood.   This has two sides, one Godward, the other manward.
   Every priest is ordained for men in things pertaining to God' (Heb. v.
   1); or, as it is said by Moses (Deut. x. 8, see also xxi. 5, xxxiii.
   10; Mal. ii. 6):  The Lord separated the tribe of Levi,  to stand
   before the Lord to minister unto Him, and to bless His Name.'  On the
   one hand, the priest had the power to draw nigh to God, to dwell with
   Him in His house, and to present before Him the blood of the sacrifice
   or the burning incense.  This work he did not do, however, on his own
   behalf, but for the sake of the people whose representative he was.
   This is the other side of his work.  He received from the people their
   sacrifices, presented them before God, and then came out to bless in
   His Name, to give the assurance of His favour and to teach them His
   law.

   A priest is thus a man who does not at all live for himself.  He lives
   with God and for God.  His work is as God's servant to care for His
   house, His honour, and His worship, to make known to men His love and
   His will.  He lives with men and for men (Heb. v. 2).  His work is to
   find out their sin and need, and to bring it before God, to offer
   sacrifice and incense in their name, to obtain forgiveness and blessing
   for them, and then to come out and bless them in His Name.  This is the
   high calling of every believer.  Such honour have all His saints.'
   They have been redeemed with the one purpose to be in the midst of the
   perishing millions around them, God's priests, who in conformity to
   Jesus, the Great High Priest, are to be the ministers and stewards of
   the grace of God to all around them.

   And then there is the walk of the priesthood, in harmony with its
   work.  As God is holy, so the priest was to be especially holy.  This
   means not only separated from everything unclean, but holy unto God,
   being set apart and given up to God for His disposal.  The separation
   from the world and setting apart unto God was indicated in many ways.

   It was seen in the clothing:  the holy garments, made after God's own
   order, marked them as His (Ex. xxviii.).  It was seen in the command as
   to their special purity and freedom from all contact from death and
   defilement (Lev. xi. 22).  Much that was allowed to an ordinary
   Israelite was forbidden to them.  It was seen in the injunction that
   the priest must have no bodily defect or blemish; bodily perfection was
   to be the type of wholeness and holiness in God's service.  And it was
   seen in the arrangement by which the priestly tribes were to have no
   inheritance with the other tribes; God was to be their inheritance.
   Their life was to be one of faith:  set apart unto God, they were to
   live on Him as well as for Him.

   All this is the emblem of what the character of the New Testament
   priest is to be.  Our priestly power with God depends on our personal
   life and walk.  We must be of them of whose walk on earth Jesus says,
   They have not defiled their garments.'

   In the surrender of what may appear lawful to others in our separation
   from the world, we must prove that our consecration to be holy to the
   Lord is whole-hearted and entire.  The bodily perfection of the priest
   must have its counterpart in our too being without spot or blemish;'
   the man of God perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works,'
   perfect and entire, wanting nothing' (Lev. xxi. 17-21; Eph. v. 27; 2
   Tim. ii. 7; Jas. i. 4).  And above all, we consent to give up all
   inheritance on earth; to forsake all, and like Christ to have only God
   as our portion:  to possess as not possessing, and hold all for God
   alone: it is this marks the true priest, the man who only lives for God
   and his fellow-men.

   And now the way to the priesthood.  In Aaron God had chosen all his
   sons to be priests:  each of them was a priest by birth.  And yet he
   could not enter upon his work without a special act of ordinance--his
   consecration.  Every child of God is priest in light of his birth, his
   blood relationship to the Great High Priest; but this is not enough:
   he will exercise his power only as he accepts and realizes his
   consecration.

   With Aaron and his sons it took place thus (Ex. xxix.):  After being
   washed and clothed, they were anointed with the holy oil.  Sacrifices
   were then offered, and with the blood the right ear, the right hand,
   and the right foot were touched.  And then they and their garments were
   once again sprinkled with the blood and the oil together.  And so it is
   as the child of God enters more fully into what THE BLOOD and THE
   SPIRIT of which he already is partaker, are to him, that the power of
   the Holy Priesthood will work in him.  The blood will take away all
   sense of unworthiness; the Spirit, all sense of unfitness.

   Let us notice what there was new in the application of the blood to the
   priest.  If ever he had as a penitent brought a sacrifice for his sin,
   seeking forgiveness, the blood was sprinkled on the altar, but not on
   his person.  But now, for priestly consecration, there was to be closer
   contact with the blood; ear and hand and foot were by a special act
   brought under its power, and the whole being taken possession of and
   sanctified for God.  And so, when the believer, who had been content to
   think chiefly of the blood sprinkled on the mercy-seat as what he needs
   for pardon, is led to seek full priestly access to God, he feels the
   need of a fuller and more abiding experience of the power of the blood,
   as really sprinkling and cleansing the heart from an evil conscience,
   so that he has no more conscience of sin' (Heb. x. 2) as cleansing from
   all sin.  And it is as he gets to enjoy this, that the consciousness is
   awakened of his wonderful right of most intimate access to God, and of
   the full assurance that his intercessions are acceptable.

   And as the blood gives the right, the Spirit gives the power, and fits
   for believing intercession.  He breathes into us the priestly
   spirit--burning love for God's honour and the saving of souls.  He
   makes us so one with Jesus that prayer in His Name is a reality.  He
   strengthens us to believing, importunate prayer.  The more the
   Christian is truly filled with the Spirit of Christ, the more
   spontaneous will be his giving himself up to the life of priestly
   intercession.  Beloved fellow-Christians!  God needs, greatly needs,
   priests who can draw near to Him, who live in His presence, and by
   their intercession draw down the blessings of His grace on others.  And
   the world needs, greatly needs, priests who will bear the burden of the
   perishing ones, and intercede on their behalf.

   Are you willing to offer yourself for this holy work?  You know the
   surrender it demands--nothing less than the Christ-like giving up of
   all, that the saving purposes of God's love may be accomplished among
   men.  Oh, be no longer of those who are content if they have salvation,
   and just do work enough to keep themselves warm and lively.  O let
   nothing keep you back from giving yourselves to be wholly and only
   priests--nothing else, nothing less than the priests of the Most High
   God.  The thought of unworthiness, of unfitness, need not keep you
   back.  In the Blood, the objective power of the perfect redemption
   works in you:  in  the Spirit its full subjective personal experience
   as a divine life is secured.  The Blood provides an infinite worthiness
   to make your prayers most acceptable:  The Spirit provides a Divine
   fitness, teaching you to pray just according to the will of God.  Every
   priest knew that when he presented a sacrifice according to the law of
   the sanctuary, it was accepted:  under the covering of the Blood and
   Spirit you have the assurance that all the wonderful promises to prayer
   in the Name of Jesus will be fulfilled in you.  Abiding in union with
   the Great High Priest, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be
   done unto you.'  You will have power to pray the effectual prayer of
   the righteous man that availeth much.  You will not only join in the
   general prayer of the Church for the world, but be able in your own
   sphere to take up your special work in prayer--as priests, to transact
   it with God, to receive and know the answer, and so to bless in His
   Name.  Come, brother, come, and be a priest, only priest, all priest.
   Seek now to walk before the Lord in the full consciousness that you
   have been set apart for the holy Ministry of Intercession.  This is the
   true blessedness of conformity to the image of God's Son.

   LORD TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O Thou my blessed High Priest, accept the consecration in which my soul
   now would respond to Thy message.

   I believe in the HOLY PRIESTHOOD OF THY SAINTS, and that I too am a
   priest, with power to appear before the Father, and in the prayer that
   avails much bring down blessing on the perishing around me.

   I believe in the POWER OF THY PRECIOUS BLOOD to cleanse from all sin,
   to give me perfect confidence toward God, and bring me near in the full
   assurance of faith that my intercession will be heard.

   I believe in the ANOINTING OF THE SPIRIT, coming down daily from Thee,
   my Great High Priest, to sanctify me, to fill me with the consciousness
   of my priestly calling, and with love to souls, to teach me what is
   according to God's will, and how to pray the prayer of faith.

   I believe that, as Thou my Lord Jesus art Thyself in all things my
   life, so Thou, too, art THE SURETY FOR MY PRAYER-LIFE, and wilt Thyself
   draw me up into the fellowship of Thy wondrous work of intercession.

   In this faith I yield myself this day to my God, as one of His anointed
   priests, to stand before His face to intercede in behalf of sinners,
   and to come out and bless in His Name.

   Holy Lord Jesus!  accept and seal my consecration.  Yea, Lord, do Thou
   lay Thy hands on me, and Thyself consecrate me to this Thy holy work.
   And let me walk among men with the consciousness and the character of a
   priest of the Most High God.

   Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins IN HIS OWN BLOOD,
   AND HATH MADE US kings and priests unto God and His Father; TO HIM be
   glory and dominion forever and ever.  Amen

THIRTY-FIRST LESSON.

  Pray without ceasing;'

  Or,    A Life of Prayer.

   Rejoice evermore.  Pray without ceasing.  In everything give thanks.--I
   Thess. v. 16, 17, 18.

   OUR Lord spake the parable of the widow and the unjust judge to teach
   us that men ought to pray always and not faint.  As the widow
   persevered in seeking one definite thing, the parable appears to have
   reference to persevering prayer for some one blessing, when God delays
   or appears to refuse.  The words in the Epistles, which speak of
   continuing instant in prayer, continuing in prayer and watching in the
   same, of praying always in the Spirit, appear more to refer to the
   whole life being one of prayer.  As the soul is filling with the
   longing for the manifestation of God's glory to us and in us, through
   us and around us, and with the confidence that He hears the prayers of
   His children; the inmost life of the soul is continually rising upward
   in dependence and faith, in longing desire and trustful expectation.

   At the close of our meditations it will not be difficult to say what is
   needed to live such a life of prayer.  The first thing is undoubtedly
   the entire sacrifice of the life to God's kingdom and glory.  He who
   seeks to pray without ceasing because he wants to be very pious and
   good, will never attain to it.  It is the forgetting of self and
   yielding ourselves to live for God and His honour that enlarges the
   heart, that teaches us to regard everything in the light of God and His
   will, and that instinctively recognises in everything around us the
   need of God's help and blessing, an opportunity for His being
   glorified.  Because everything is weighed and tested by the one thing
   that fills the heart--the glory of God, and because the soul has learnt
   that only what is of God can really be to Him and His glory, the whole
   life becomes a looking up, a crying from the inmost heart, for God to
   prove His power and love and so show forth His glory.  The believer
   awakes to the consciousness that he is one of the watchmen on Zion's
   walls, one of the Lord's remembrancers, whose call does really touch
   and move the King in heaven to do what would otherwise not be done.  He
   understands how real Paul's exhortation was, praying always with all
   prayer and supplication in the Spirit for all the saints and for me,'
   and continue in prayer, withal praying also for us.'  To forget
   oneself, to live for God and His kingdom among men, is the way to learn
   to pray without ceasing.

   This life devoted to God must be accompanied by the deep confidence
   that our prayer is effectual.  We have seen how our Blessed Lord
   insisted upon nothing so much in His prayer-lessons as faith in the
   Father as a God who most certainly does what we ask.  Ask and ye shall
   receive;' count confidently on an answer, is with Him the beginning and
   the end of His teaching (compare Matt. vii. 8 and John xvi. 24).  In
   proportion as this assurance masters us, and it becomes a settled thing
   that our prayers do tell and that God does what we ask, we dare not
   neglect the use of this wonderful power:  the soul turns wholly to God,
   and our life becomes prayer.  We see that the Lord needs and takes
   time, because we and all around us are the creatures of time, under the
   law of growth; but knowing that not one single prayer of faith can
   possibly be lost that there is sometimes a needs-be for the storing up
   and accumulating of prayer, that persevering pray is irresistible,
   prayer becomes the quiet, persistent living of our life of desire and
   faith in the presence of our God.  O do not let us any longer by our
   reasonings limit and enfeeble such free and sure promises of the living
   God, robbing them of their power, and ourselves of the wonderful
   confidence they are meant to inspire.  Not in God, not in His secret
   will, not in the limitations of His promises, but in us, in ourselves
   is the hindrance; we are not what we should be to obtain the promise.
   Let us open our whole heart to God's words of promise in all their
   simplicity and truth:  they will search us and humble us; they will
   lift us up and make us glad and strong.  And to the faith that knows it
   gets what it asks, prayer is not a work or a burden, but a joy and a
   triumph; it becomes a necessity and a second nature.

   This union of strong desire and firm confidence again is nothing but
   the life of the Holy Spirit within us.  The Holy Spirit dwells in us,
   hides Himself in the depths of our being, and stirs the desire after
   the Unseen and the Divine, after God Himself.  Now in groanings that
   cannot be uttered, then in clear and conscious assurance; now in
   special distinct petitions for the deeper revelation of Christ to
   ourselves, then in pleadings for a soul, a work, the Church or the
   world, it is always and alone the Holy Spirit who draws out the heart
   to thirst for God, to long for His being made known and glorified.
   Where the child of God really lives and walks in the Spirit, where he
   is not content to remain carnal, but seeks to be spiritual, in
   everything a fit organ for the Divine Spirit to reveal the life of
   Christ and Christ Himself, there the never-ceasing intercession-life of
   the Blessed Son cannot but reveal and repeat itself in our experience.
   Because it is the Spirit of Christ who prays in us, our prayer must be
   heard; because it is we who pray in the Spirit, there is need of time,
   and patience, and continual renewing of the prayer, until every
   obstacle be conquered, and the harmony between God's Spirit and ours is
   perfect.

   But the chief thing we need for such a life of unceasing prayer is, to
   know that Jesus teaches us to pray.  We have begun to understand a
   little what His teaching is.  Not the communication of new thoughts or
   views, not the discovery of failure or error, not the stirring up of
   desire and faith, of however much importance all this be, but the
   taking us up into the fellowship of His own prayer-life before the
   Father--this it is by which Jesus really teaches.  It was the sight of
   the praying Jesus that made the disciples long and ask to be taught to
   pray.  It is the faith of the ever-praying Jesus, whose alone is the
   power to pray, that teaches us truly to pray.  We know why:  He who
   prays is our Head and our Life.  All He has is ours and is given to us
   when we give ourselves all to Him.  By His blood He leads us into the
   immediate presence of God.  The inner sanctuary is our home, we dwell
   there.  And He that lives so near God, and knows that He has been
   brought near to bless those who are far, cannot but pray.  Christ makes
   us partakers with Himself of His prayer-power and prayer-life.  We
   understand then that our true aim must not be to work much and have
   prayer enough to keep the work right, but to pray much and then to work
   enough for the power and blessing obtained in prayer to find its way
   through us to men.  It is Christ who ever lives to pray, who saves and
   reigns.  He communicates His prayer-life to us:  He maintains it in us
   if we trust Him.  He is surety for our praying without ceasing.  Yes,
   Christ teaches to pray by showing how He does it, by doing it in us, by
   leading us to do it in Him and like Him.  Christ is all, the life and
   the strength too for a never-ceasing prayer-life.

   It is the sight of this, the sight of the ever-praying Christ as our
   life, that enables us to pray without ceasing.  Because His priesthood
   is the power of an endless life, that resurrection-life that never
   fades and never fails, and  because His life is our life, praying
   without ceasing can become to us nothing less than the life-joy of
   heaven.  So the Apostle says:  Rejoice evermore; pray without ceasing;
   in everything give thanks.'  Borne up between the never-ceasing joy and
   the never-ceasing praise, never-ceasing prayer is the manifestation of
   the power of the eternal life, where Jesus always prays.  The union
   between the Vine and the branch is in very deed a prayer-union.  The
   highest conformity to Christ, the most blessed participation in the
   glory of His heavenly life, is that we take part in His work of
   intercession:  He and we live ever to pray.  In the experience of our
   union with Him, praying without ceasing becomes a possibility, a
   reality, the holiest and most blessed part of our holy and blessed
   fellowship with God.  We have our abode within the veil, in the
   presence of the Father.  What the Father says, we do; what the Son
   says, the Father does.  Praying without ceasing is the earthly
   manifestation of heaven come down to us, the foretaste of the life
   where they rest not day or night in the song of worship and adoration.

   LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY.'

   ----0----

   O my Father, with my whole heart do I praise Thee for this wondrous
   life of never-ceasing prayer, never-ceasing fellowship, never-ceasing
   answers, and never-ceasing experience of my oneness with Him who ever
   lives to pray.  O my God!  keep me ever so dwelling and walking in the
   presence of Thy glory, that prayer may be the spontaneous expression of
   my life with Thee.

   Blessed Saviour!  with my whole heart I praise Thee that Thou didst
   come from heaven to share with me in my needs and cries, that I might
   share with Thee in Thy all-prevailing intercession.  And I thank Thee
   that Thou hast taken me into the school of prayer, to teach the
   blessedness and the power of a life that is all prayer.  And most of
   all, that Thou hast taken me up into the fellowship of Thy life of
   intercession, that through me too Thy blessings may be dispensed to
   those around me.

   Holy Spirit!  with deep reverence I thank Thee for Thy work in me.  It
   is through Thee I am lifted up into a share in the intercourse between
   the Son and the Father, and enter so into the fellowship of the life
   and love of the Holy Trinity Spirit of God!  perfect Thy work in me;
   bring me into perfect union with Christ my Intercessor.  Let Thine
   unceasing indwelling make my life one of unceasing intercession.  And
   let so my life become one that is unceasingly to the glory of the
   Father and to the blessing of those around me.  Amen.

GEORGE MULLER, AND THE SECRET OF HIS

   POWER IN PRAYER

   WHEN God wishes anew to teach His Church a truth that is not being
   understood or practised, He mostly does so by raising some man to be in
   word and deed a living witness to its blessedness.  And so God has
   raised up in this nineteenth century, among others, George Muller to be
   His witness that He is indeed the Hearer of prayer.   I know of no way
   in which the principal truths of God's word in regard to prayer can be
   more effectually illustrated and established than a short review of his
   life and of what he tells of his prayer-experiences.

   He was born in Prussia on 25^th September 1805, and is thus now eighty
   years of age.  His early life, even after having entered the University
   of Halle as a theological student, was wicked in the extreme.  Led by a
   friend one evening, when just twenty years of age, to a prayer meeting,
   he was deeply impressed, and soon after brought to know the Saviour.
   Not long after he began reading missionary papers, and in course of
   time offered himself to the London Society for promoting Christianity
   to the Jews.  He was accepted as a student, but soon found that he
   could not in all things submit to the rules of the Society, as leaving
   too little liberty for the leading of the Holy Spirit.  The connection
   was dissolved in 1830 by mutual consent, and he became the pastor of a
   small congregation at Teignmouth.  In 1832 he was led to Bristol, and
   it was as pastor of Bethesda Chapel that he was led to the Orphan Home
   and other work, in connection with which God has so remarkably led him
   to trust His word and to experience how God fulfils that word.

   A few extracts in regard to his spiritual life will prepare the way for
   what we specially wish to quote of his experiences in reference to
   prayer.

   In connection with this I would mention, that the Lord very graciously
   gave me, from the very commencement of my divine life, a measure of
   simplicity and of childlike disposition in spiritual things, so that
   whilst I was exceedingly ignorant of the Scriptures, and was still from
   time to time overcome even by outward sins, yet I was enabled to carry
   most minute matters to the Lord in prayer.  And I have found "godliness
   profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and
   of that which is to come."  Though very weak and ignorant, yet I had
   now, by the grace of God, some desire to benefit others, and he who so
   faithfully had once served Satan, sought now to win souls for Christ.'

   It was at Teignmouth that he was led to know how to use God's word ,
   and to trust the Holy Spirit as the Teacher given by God to make that
   word clear.  He writes:--

   God then began to show me that the word of God alone is our standard of
   judgment in spiritual things; that it can be explained only by the Holy
   Spirit; and that in our day, as well as in former times.  He is the
   Teacher of His people.  The office of the Holy Spirit I had not
   experimentally understood before that time.

   It was my beginning to understand this latter point in particular,
   which had a great effect on me; for the Lord enabled me to put it to
   the test of experience, by laying aside commentaries, and almost every
   other book and simply reading the word  of God and studying it.

   The result of this was, that the first evening that I shut myself into
   my room, to give myself to prayer and meditation over the Scriptures, I
   learned more in a few hours than I had done during a period of several
   months previously.

   But the particular difference was that I received real strength for my
   soul in so doing.  I now began to try by the test of the Scriptures the
   things which I had learned and seen, and found that only those
   principles which stood the test were of real value.'

   Of obedience to the word of God, he writes as follows, in connection
   with his being baptized:--

   It had pleased God, in His abundant mercy, to bring my mind into such a
   state, that I was willing to carry out into my life whatever I should
   find in the Scriptures.  I could say, "I will do His will," and it was
   on that account, I believe, that I saw which "doctrine is of God."--And
   I would observe here, by the way, that the passage to which I have just
   alluded (John vii. 17) has been a most remarkable comment to me on many
   doctrines and precepts of our most holy faith.  For instance:  "Resist
   not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to
   him the other also.  And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take
   away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.  And whosoever shall compel
   thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  Give to him that asketh thee,
   and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away.  Love your
   enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and
   pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you" (Matt. v.
   39-44).  "Sell that ye have, and give alms"(Luke xii. 33).  "Owe no man
   any thing, but to love one another"(Rom. xii. 8).  It may be said,
   "Surely these passages cannot be taken literally, for how then would
   the people of God be able to pass through the world?"  The state of
   mind enjoined in John vii. 17 will cause such objections to vanish.
   WHOSOEVER IS WILLING TO ACT OUT these commandments of the Lord
   LITERALLY, will, I believe, be led with me to see that to take them
   LITERALLY is the will of God.--Those who do so take them will doubtless
   often be brought into difficulties, hard to the flesh to bear, but
   these will have a tendency to make them constantly feel that they are
   strangers and pilgrims here, that this world is not their home, and
   thus to throw them more upon God, who will assuredly help us through
   any difficulty into which we may be brought by seeking to act in
   obedience to His word.'

   This implicit surrender to God's word led him to certain views and
   conduct in regard to money, which mightily influenced his future life.
   They had their root in the conviction that money was a Divine
   stewardship, and that all money had therefore to be received and
   dispensed in direct fellowship with God Himself.  This led him to the
   adoption of the following four great rules:  1.  Not to receive any
   fixed salary, both because in the collecting of it there was often much
   that was at variance with the freewill offering with which God's
   service is to be maintained, and in the receiving of it a danger of
   placing more dependence on human sources of income than in the living
   God Himself.  2.  Never to ask any human being for help, however great
   the need might be, but to make his wants known to the God who has
   promised to care for His servants and to hear their prayer.  3.  To
   take this command (Luke xii. 33) literally, Sell that thou hast and
   give alms,' and never to save up money, but to spend all God entrusted
   to him on God's poor, on the work of His kingdom.  4.  Also to take
   Rom. xiii. 8, Owe no man anything,' literally, and never to buy on
   credit, or be in debt for anything, but to trust God to provide.

   This mode of living was not easy at first.  But Muller testifies it was
   most blessed in bringing the soul to rest in God, and drawing it into
   closer union with Himself when inclined to backslide.  For it will not
   do, it is not possible, to live in sin, and at the same time, by
   communion with God, to draw down from heaven everything one needs for
   the life that now is.'

   Not long after his settlement at Bristol, THE SCRIPTURAL KNOWLEDGE
   INSTITUTION FOR HOME AND ABROAD' was established for aiding in Day,
   Sunday School, Mission and Bible work.  Of this Institution the Orphan
   Home work, by which Mr. Muller is best known, became a branch.  It was
   in 1834 that his heart was touched by the case of an orphan brought to
   Christ in one of the schools, but who had to go to a poorhouse where
   its spiritual wants would not be cared for.  Meeting shortly after with
   a life of Franke, he writes (Nov, 20, 1835):  Today I have had it very
   much laid on my heart no longer merely to think about the establishment
   of an Orphan Home, but actually to set about it, and I have been very
   much in prayer respecting it, in order to ascertain the Lord's mind.
   May God make it plain.'  And again, Nov. 25:  I have been again much in
   prayer yesterday and today about the Orphan Home, and am more and more
   convinced that it is of God.  May He in mercy guide me.  The three
   chief reasons are--1.  That God may be glorified, should He be pleased
   to furnish me with the means, in its being seen that it is not a vain
   thing to trust Him; and that thus the faith of His children may be
   strengthened.  2.  The spiritual welfare of fatherless and motherless
   children.  3.  Their temporal welfare.'

   After some months of prayer and waiting on God, a house was rented,
   with room for thirty children , and in course of time three more,
   containing in all 120 children.  The work was carried on it this way
   for ten years, the supplies for the needs of the orphans being asked
   and received of God alone.  It was often a time of sore need and much
   prayer, but a trial of faith more precious than of gold was found unto
   praise and honour and glory of God.  The Lord was preparing His servant
   for greater things.  By His providence and His Holy Spirit, Mr. Muller
   was led to desire, and to wait upon God till he received from Him, the
   sure promise of Â£15,000 for a Home to contain 300 children.  This first
   Home was opened in 1849.  In 1858, a second and third Home, for 950
   more orphans, was opened, costing Â£35,000.  And in 1869 and 1870, a
   fourth and a fifth Home, for 850 more, at an expense of Â£50,000, making
   the total number of the orphans 2100.

   In addition to this work, God has given him almost as much as for the
   building of the Orphan Homes, and the maintenance of the orphans, for
   other work, the support of schools and missions, Bible and tract
   circulation.  In all he has received from God, to be spent in His work,
   during these fifty years, more than one million pounds sterling.  How
   little he knew, let us carefully notice, that when he gave up his
   little salary of Â£35 a year in obedience to the leading of God's word
   and the Holy Spirit, what God was preparing to give him as the reward
   of obedience and faith; and how wonderfully the word was to be
   fulfilled to him:  Thou hast been faithful over few things; I will set
   thee over many things.'

   And these things have happened for an ensample to us.  God calls us to
   be followers of George Muller, even as he is of Christ.  His God is our
   God; the same promises are for us; the same service of love and faith
   in which he laboured is calling for us on every side.  Let us in
   connection with our lessons in the school of prayer study the way in
   which God gave George Muller such power as a man of prayer:  we shall
   find in it the most remarkable illustration of some of the lessons
   which we have been studying with the blessed Master in the word.  We
   shall specially have impressed upon us His first great lesson, that if
   we will come to Him in the way He has pointed out, with definite
   petitions, made known to us by the Spirit through the word as being
   according to the will of God, we may most confidently believe that
   whatsoever we ask it shall be done.

   PRAYER AND THE WORD OF GOD.

   We have more than once seen that God's listening to our voice depends
   upon our listening to His voice.  (See Lessons 22 and 23.)  We must not
   only have a special promise to plead, when we make a special request,
   but our whole life must be under the supremacy of the word:  the word
   must be dwelling in us.  The testimony of George Muller on this point
   is most instructive.  He tells us how the discovery of the true place
   of the word of God, and the teaching of the Spirit with it, was the
   commencement of a new era in his spiritual life.  Of it he writes:--

   Now the scriptural way of reasoning would have been:  God Himself has
   condescended to become an author, and I am ignorant about that precious
   book which His Holy Spirit has caused to be written through the
   instrumentality of His servants, and it contains that which I ought to
   know, and the knowledge of which will lead me to true happiness;
   therefore I ought to read again and again this most precious book, this
   book of books, most earnestly, most prayerfully, and with much
   meditation; and in this practice I ought to continue all the days of my
   life.  For I was aware, though I read it but little, that I knew
   scarcely anything of it.  But instead of acting thus and being led by
   my ignorance of the word of God to study it more, my difficulty in
   understanding it, and the little enjoyment I had in it, made me
   careless of reading it (for much prayerful reading of the word gives
   not merely more knowledge, but increases the delight we have in reading
   it); and thus, like many believers, I practically preferred, for the
   first four years of my divine life, the works of uninspired men to the
   oracles of the living God.  The consequence was that I remained a babe,
   both in knowledge and grace.  In knowledge, I say; for all true
   knowledge must be derived, by the Spirit, from the word.  And as I
   neglected the word, I was for nearly four years so ignorant, that I did
   not clearly know even the fundamental points of our holy faith.  And
   this lack of knowledge most sadly kept me back from walking steadily in
   the ways of God.  For when it pleased the Lord in August 1829 to bring
   me really to the Scriptures, my life and walk became very different.
   And though ever since that I have very much fallen short of what I
   might and ought to be, yet by the grace of God I have been enabled to
   live much nearer to Him than before.  If any believers read this who
   practically prefer other books to the Holy Scriptures, and who enjoy
   the writings of men much more than the word of God, may they be warned
   by my loss.  I shall consider this book to have been the means of doing
   much good, should it please the Lord, through its instrumentality, to
   lead some of His people no longer to neglect the Holy Scriptures, but
   to give them that preference which they have hitherto bestowed on the
   writings of men.

   Before I leave this subject, I would only add:  If the reader
   understands very little of the word of God, he ought to read it very
   much; for the Spirit explains the word by the word.  And if he enjoys
   the reading of the word little, that is just the reason why he should
   read it much; for the frequent reading of the Scriptures creates a
   delight in them, so that the more we read them, the more we desire to
   do so.

   Above all, he should seek to have it settled in his own mind that God
   alone by His Spirit can teach him, and that therefore, as God will be
   inquired of for blessings, it becomes him to seek God's blessing
   previous to reading, and also whilst reading.

   He should have it, moreover, settled in his mind that although the Holy
   Spirit is the best and sufficient Teacher, yet that this Teacher does
   not always teach immediately when we desire it, and that therefore we
   may have to entreat Him again and again for the explanation of certain
   passages; but that He will surely teach us at last, if indeed we are
   seeking for light prayerfully, patiently, and with a view to the glory
   of God.' [4]

    We find in his journal frequent mention made of his spending two and
   three hours in prayer over the word for the feeding of his spiritual
   life.  As the fruit of this, when he had need of strength and
   encouragement in prayer, the individual promises were not to him so
   many arguments from a book to be used with God, but living words which
   he had heard the Father's living voice speak to him, and which he could
   now bring to the Father in living faith.

   PRAYER AND THE WILL OF GOD.

   One of the greatest difficulties with young believers is to know how
   they can find out whether what they desire is according to God's will.
   I count it one of the most precious lessons God wants to teach through
   the experience of George Muller, that He is willing to make known, of
   things of which His word says nothing directly, that they are His will
   for us, and that we may ask them.  The teaching of the Spirit, not
   without or against the word, but as something above and beyond it, in
   addition to it, without which we cannot see God's will, is the heritage
   of every believer.  It is through THE WORD, AND THE WORD ALONE, that
   the Spirit teaches, applying the general principles or promises to our
   special need.  And it is THE SPIRIT, AND THE SPIRIT ALONE, who can
   really make the word a light on our path, whether the path of duty in
   our daily walk, or the path of faith in our approach to God.  Let us
   try and notice in what childlike simplicity and teachableness it was
   that the discovery of God's will was so surely and so clearly made
   known to His servant.

   With regard to the building of the first Home and the assurance he had
   of its being God's will, he writes in May 1850, just after it had been
   opened, speaking of the great difficulties there were, and how little
   likely it appeared to nature that they would be removed:  But while the
   prospect before me would have been overwhelming had I looked at it
   naturally, I was never even for once permitted to question how it would
   end.  For as from the beginning I was sure it was the will of God that
   I should go to the work of building for Him this large Orphan Home, so
   also from the beginning I was as certain that the whole would be
   finished as if the Home had been already filled.'

   The way in which he found out what was God's will, comes out with
   special clearness in his account of the building of the second Home;
   and I ask the reader to study with care the lesson the narrative
   conveys:--

   Dec. 5, 1850.--Under these circumstances I can only pray that the Lord
   in His tender mercy would not allow Satan to gain an advantage over
   me.  By the grace of God my heart says:  Lord, if I could be sure that
   it is Thy will that I should go forward in this matter, I would do so
   cheerfully; and, on the other hand, if I could be sure that these are
   vain, foolish, proud thoughts, that they are not from Thee, I would, by
   Thy grace, hate them, and entirely put them aside.

   My hope is in God:  He will help and teach me.  Judging, however, from
   His former dealings with me, it would not be a strange thing to me, nor
   surprising, if He called me to labour yet still more largely in this
   way.

   The thoughts about enlarging the Orphan work have not yet arisen on
   account of an abundance of money having lately come in; for I have had
   of late to wait for about seven weeks upon God, whilst little, very
   little comparatively, came in, i.e. about four times as much was going
   out as came in; and, had not the Lord previously sent me large sums, we
   should have been distressed indeed.

   Lord!  how can Thy servant know Thy will in this matter?  Wilt Thou be
   pleased to teach him!

   December 11.--During the last six days, since writing the above, I have
   been, day after day, waiting upon God concerning this matter.  It has
   generally been more or less all the day on my heart.  When I have been
   awake at night, it has not been far from my thoughts.  Yet all this
   without the least excitement.  I am perfectly calm and quiet respecting
   it.  My soul would be rejoiced to go forward in this service, could I
   be sure that the Lord would have me to do so; for then, notwithstanding
   the numberless difficulties, all would be well; and His Name would be
   magnified.

   On the other hand, were I assured that the Lord would have me to be
   satisfied with my present sphere of service, and that I should not pray
   about enlarging the work, by His grace I could, without an effort,
   cheerfully yield to it; for He has brought me into such a state of
   heart, that I only desire to please Him in this matter.  Moreover,
   hitherto I have not spoken about this thing even to my beloved wife,
   the sharer of my joys, sorrows, and labours for more than twenty years;
   nor is it likely that I shall do so for some time to come:  for I
   prefer quietly to wait on the Lord, without conversing on this subject,
   in order that thus I may be kept the more easily, by His blessing, from
   being influenced by things from without.  The burden of my prayer
   concerning this matter is, that the Lord would not allow me to make a
   mistake, and that He would teach me to do His will.

   December 26.--Fifteen days have elapsed since I wrote the preceding
   paragraph.  Every day since then I have continued to pray about this
   matter, and that with a goodly measure of earnestness, by the help of
   God.  There has passed scarcely an hour during these days, in which,
   whilst awake, this matter has not been more or less before me.  But all
   without even a shadow of excitement.  I converse with no one about it.
   Hitherto have I not even done so with my dear wife.  For this I refrain
   still, and deal with God alone about the matter, in order that no
   outward influence and no outward excitement may keep me from attaining
   unto a clear discovery of His will.  I have the fullest and most
   peaceful assurance that He will clearly show me His will.  This evening
   I have had again an especial solemn season for prayer, to seek to know
   the will of God.  But whilst I continue to entreat and beseech the
   Lord, that He would not allow me to be deluded in this business, I may
   say I have scarcely any doubt remaining on my mind as to what will be
   the issue, even that I should go forward in this matter.  As this,
   however, is one of the most momentous steps that I have ever taken, I
   judge that I cannot go about this matter with too much caution,
   prayerfulness, and deliberation.  I am in no hurry about it.  I could
   wait for years, by God's grace, were this His will, before even taking
   one single step toward this thing, or even speaking to anyone about it;
   and, on the other hand, I would set to work tomorrow, were the Lord to
   bid me do so.  This calmness of mind, this having no will of my own in
   the matter, this only wishing to please my Heavenly Father in it, this
   only seeking His and not my honour in it; this state of heart, I say,
   is the fullest assurance to me that my heart is not under a fleshly
   excitement, and that, if I am helped thus to go on, I shall know the
   will of God to the full.  But, while I write this, I cannot but add at
   the same time, that I do crave the honour and the glorious privilege to
   be more and more used by the Lord.

   I desire to be allowed to provide scriptural instruction for a thousand
   orphans, instead of doing so for 300.  I desire to expound the Holy
   Scriptures regularly to a thousand orphans, instead of doing so to
   300.  I desire that it may be yet more abundantly manifest that God is
   still the Hearer and Answerer of prayer, and that He is the living God
   now as He ever was and ever will be, when He shall simply, in answer to
   prayer, have condescended to provide me with a house for 700 orphans
   and with means to support them.  This last consideration is the most
   important point in my mind.  The Lord's honour is the principal point
   with me in this whole matter; and just because this is the case, if He
   would be more glorified by not going forward in this business, I should
   by His grace be perfectly content to give up all thoughts about another
   Orphan House.  Surely in such a state of mind, obtained by the Holy
   Spirit, Thou, O my Heavenly Father, wilt not suffer Thy child to be
   mistaken, much less deluded.  By the help of God I shall continue
   further day by day to wait upon Him in prayer, concerning this thing,
   till He shall bid me act.

   Jan. 2, 1851.--A week ago I wrote the preceding paragraph.  During this
   week I have still been helped day by day, and more than once every day,
   to seek the guidance of the Lord about another Orphan House.  The
   burden of my prayer has still been, that He in His great mercy would
   keep me from making a mistake.  During the last week the book of
   Proverbs has come in the course of my Scripture reading, and my heart
   has been refreshed in reference to this subject by the following
   passages:  "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto
   thine own understanding.  In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall
   direct thy paths"  (Prov. iii. 5, 6).  By the grace of God I do
   acknowledge the Lord in all my ways, and in this thing in particular; I
   have therefore the comfortable assurance that He will direct my paths
   concerning this part of my service, as to whether I shall be occupied
   in it our not.  Further:  "The integrity of the upright shall preserve
   them"  (Prov. xi. 3).  By the grace of God I am upright in this
   business.  My honest purpose is to get glory to God.  Therefore I
   expect to be guided aright.  Further:  "Commit thy works unto the Lord,
   and thy thoughts shall be established"  (Prov. xvi. 3).   I do commit
   my works unto the Lord, and therefore expect that my thoughts will be
   established.  My heart is more and more coming to a calm, quiet, and
   settled assurance, that the Lord will condescend to use me still
   further in the orphan work.  Here Lord is Thy servant.'

   When later he decided to build two additional houses, Nos. 4 and 5, he
   writes thus again:--

   Twelve days have passed away since I wrote the last paragraph.  I have
   still day by day been enabled to wait upon the Lord with reference to
   enlarging the Orphan work, and have been during the whole of this
   period also in perfect peace, which is the result of seeking in this
   thing only the Lord's honour and the temporal and spiritual benefit of
   my fellow-men.  Without an effort could I by His grace put aside all
   thoughts about this whole affair, if only assured that it is the will
   of God that I should do so; and, on the other hand, would at once go
   forward, if He would have it be so.  I have still kept this matter
   entirely to myself.  Though it be now about seven weeks, since day by
   day, more or less, my mind has been exercised about it, and since I
   have been daily praying about it, yet not one human being knows of it.
   As yet I have not even mentioned it to my dear wife in order that thus,
   by quietly waiting upon God, I might not be influenced by what might be
   said to me on the subject.  This evening has been particularly set
   apart for prayer, beseeching the Lord once more not to allow me to be
   mistaken in this thing, and much less to be deluded by the devil.  I
   have also sought to let all the reasons against building another Orphan
   House, and all the reasons for doing so pass before my mind:  and now
   for the clearness and definiteness, write them down. . . .

   Much, however, as the nine previous reasons weigh with me, yet they
   would not decide me were there not one more.  It is this.  After having
   for months pondered the matter, and having looked at it in all its
   bearings and with all its difficulties, and then having been finally
   led, after much prayer, to decide on this enlargement, my mind is at
   peace.  The child who has again and again besought His Heavenly Father
   not to allow him to be deluded, nor even to make a mistake, is at
   peace, perfectly at peace concerning this decision; and has thus the
   assurance that the decision come to, after much prayer during weeks and
   months, is the leading of the Holy Spirit; and therefore purposes to go
   forward, assuredly believing that he will not be confounded, for he
   trusts in God.  Many and great may be his difficulties; thousands and
   ten thousands of prayers may have ascended to God, before the full
   answer may be obtained; much exercise of faith and patience may be
   required; but in the end it will again be seen, that His servant, who
   trusts in Him, has not been confounded.'

   PRAYER AND THE GLORY OF GOD.

   We have sought more than once to enforce the truth, that while we
   ordinarily seek the reasons of our prayers not being heard in the thing
   we ask not being according to the will of God, Scripture warns us to
   find the cause in ourselves, in our not being in the right state or not
   asking in the right spirit.  The thing may be in full accordance with
   His will, but the asking, the spirit of the supplicant, not; then we
   are not heard.  As the great root of all sin is self and self-seeking,
   so there is nothing that even in our more spiritual desires so
   effectually hinders God in answering as this:  we pray for our own
   pleasure or glory.  Prayer to have power and prevail must ask for the
   glory of God; and he can only do this as he is living for God's glory.

   In George Muller we have one of the most remarkable instances on record
   of God's Holy Spirit leading a man deliberately and systematically, at
   the outset of a course of prayer, to make the glorifying of God his
   first and only object.  Let us ponder well what he says, and learn the
   lesson God would teach us through him:--

   I had constantly cases brought before me, which proved that one of the
   especial things which the children of God needed in our day, was to
   have their faith strengthened.

   I longed, therefore, to have something to point my brethren to, as a
   visible proof that our God and Father is the same faithful God as ever
   He was; as willing as ever to PROVE Himself to be the LIVING GOD in our
   day as formerly, to all who put their trust in Him.

   My spirit longed to be instrumental in strengthening their faith, by
   giving them not only instances from the word of God, of His willingness
   and ability to help all who rely upon Him, but to show them by proofs
   that He is the same in our day.  I knew that the word of God ought to
   be enough, and it was by grace enough for me; but still I considered I
   ought to lend a helping hand to my brethren.

   I therefore judged myself bound to be the servant of the Church of
   Christ, in the particular point in which I had obtained mercy; namely,
   in being able to take God at His word and rely upon it.  The first
   object of the work was, and is still:  that God might be magnified by
   the fact that the orphans under my care are provided with all they
   need, only by prayer and faith, without any one being asked; thereby it
   may be seen that God is FAITHFUL STILL, AND HEARS PRAYER STILL.

   I have again these last days prayed much about the Orphan House, and
   have frequently examined my heart; that if it were at all my desire to
   establish it for the sake of gratifying myself, I might find it out.
   For as I desire only the Lord's glory, I shall be glad to be instructed
   by the instrumentality of my brother, if the matter be not of Him.

   When I began the Orphan work in 1835, my chief object was the glory of
   God, by giving a practical demonstration as to what could be
   accomplished simply through the instrumentality of prayer and faith, in
   order thus to benefit the Church at large, and to lead a careless world
   to see the reality of the things of God, by showing them in this work,
   that the living God is still, as 4000 years ago, the living God.  This
   my aim has been abundantly honoured.  Multitudes of sinners have been
   thus converted, multitudes of the children of God in all parts of the
   world have been benefited by this work, even as I had anticipated.  But
   the larger the work as grown, the greater has been the blessing,
   bestowed in the very way in which I looked for blessing:  for the
   attention of hundreds of thousands has been drawn to the work; and many
   tens of thousands have come to see it.  All this leads me to desire
   further and further to labour on in this way, in order to bring yet
   greater glory to the Name of the Lord.  That He may be looked at,
   magnified, admired, trusted in, relied on at all times, is my aim in
   this service; and so particularly in this intended enlargement.  That
   it may be seen how much one poor man, simply by trusting in God, can
   bring about by prayer; and that thus other children of God may be led
   to carry on the work of God in dependence upon Him; and that children
   of God may be led increasingly to trust in Him in their individual
   positions and circumstances, therefore I am led to this further
   enlargement.'

   PRAYER AND TRUST IN GOD.

   There are other points on which I would be glad to point out what is to
   be found in Mr. Muller's narrative, but one more must suffice.  It is
   the lesson of firm and unwavering trust in God's promise as the secret
   of persevering prayer.  If once we have, in submission to the teaching
   of the Spirit in the word, taken hold of God's promise, and believed
   that the Father has heard us, we must not allow ourselves by any delay
   or unfavourable appearances be shaken in our faith.

   The full answer to my daily prayers was far from being realized; yet
   there was abundant encouragement granted by the Lord, to continue in
   prayer.  But suppose, even, that far less had come in than was
   received, still, after having come to the conclusion, upon scriptural
   grounds, after much prayer and self-examination, I ought to have gone
   on without wavering, in the exercise of faith and patience concerning
   this object; and thus all the children of God, when once satisfied that
   anything which they bring before God in prayer, is according to His
   will, ought to continue in believing, expecting, persevering prayer
   until the blessing is granted.  Thus am I myself now waiting upon God
   for certain blessings, for which I have daily besought Him for ten
   years and six months without one day's intermission.  Still the full
   answer is not yet given concerning the conversion of certain
   individuals, though in the meantime I have received many thousands of
   answers to prayer.  I have also prayed daily without intermission for
   the conversion of other individuals about ten years, for others six or
   seven years, for others from three or two years; and still the answer
   is not yet granted concerning those persons, while in the meantime many
   thousands of my prayers have been answered, and also souls converted,
   for whom I had been praying.  I lay particular stress on this for the
   benefit of those who may suppose that I need only to ask of God, and
   receive at once; or that I might pray concerning anything, and the
   answer would surely come.  One can only expect to obtain answers to
   prayers which are according to the mind of God; and even then, patience
   and faith may be exercised for many years, even as mine are exercised,
   in the matter to which I have referred; and yet am I daily continuing
   in prayer, and expecting the answer, and so surely expecting the
   answer, that I have often thanked God that He will surely give it,
   though now for nineteen years faith and patience have thus been
   exercised.  Be encouraged, dear Christians, with fresh earnestness to
   give yourselves to prayer, if you can only be sure that you ask things
   which are for the glory of God.

   But the most remarkable point is this, that  Â£6, 6s. 6d. from Scotland
   supplied me, as far as can be known now, with all the means necessary
   for fitting up and promoting the New Orphan Houses.  Six years and
   eight months I have been day by day, and generally several times daily,
   asking the Lord to give me the needed means for this enlargement of the
   Orphan work, which, according to calculations made in the spring of
   1861, appeared to be about fifty thousand pounds:  the total of this
   amount I had now received.  I praise and magnify the Lord for putting
   this enlargement of the work into my heart, and for giving me courage
   and faith for it; and above all, for sustaining my faith day by day
   without wavering.  When the last portion of the money was received, I
   was no more assured concerning the whole, that I was at the time I had
   not received one single donation towards this large sum.  I was at the
   beginning, after once having ascertained His mind, through most patient
   and heart-searching waiting upon God, as fully assured that He would
   bring it about, as if the two houses, with their hundreds of orphans
   occupying them, had been already before me.  I make a few remarks here
   for the sake of young believers in connection with this subject:  1.
   Be slow to take new steps in the Lord's service, or in your business,
   or in your families:  weigh everything well; weigh all in the light of
   the Holy Scriptures and in the fear of God.  2.  Seek to have no will
   of your own, in order to ascertain the mind of God, regarding any steps
   you propose taking, so that you can honestly say you are willing to do
   the will of God, if He will only please to instruct you.  3.  But when
   you have found out what the will of God is, seek for His help, and seek
   it earnestly, perseveringly, patiently, believingly, expectantly; and
   you will surely in His own time and way obtain it.

   To suppose that we have difficulty about money only would be a
   mistake:  there occur hundreds of other wants and of other
   difficulties.  It is a rare thing that a day occurs without some
   difficulty or some want; but often there are many difficulties and many
   wants to be met and overcome the same day.  All these are met by prayer
   and faith, our universal remedy; and we have never been confounded.
   Patient, persevering, believing prayer, offered up to God, in the Name
   of the Lord Jesus, has always, sooner or later, brought the blessing.
   I do not despair, by God's grace, of obtaining any blessing, provided I
   can be sure it would be for any real good, and for the glory of God.
