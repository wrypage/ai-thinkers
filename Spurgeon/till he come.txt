   PREFATORY NOTE.

   For many years, whether at home or abroad, it was Mr. Spurgeon's
   constant custom to observe the ordinance of the Lord's supper every
   Sabbath-day, unless illness prevented. This he believed to be in
   accordance with apostolic precedent; and it was his oft-repeated
   testimony that the more frequently he obeyed his Lord's command, "This
   do in remembrance of Me," the more precious did his Saviour become to
   him, while the memorial celebration itself proved increasingly helpful
   and instructive as the years rolled by.

   Several of the discourses here published were delivered to thousands of
   communicants in the Metropolitan Tabernacle, while others were
   addressed to the little companies of Christians,--of different
   denominations, and of various nationalities,--who gathered around the
   communion table in Mr. Spurgeon's sitting-room at Mentone. The
   addresses cover a wide range of subjects; but all of them speak more or
   less fully of the great atoning sacrifice of which the broken bread and
   the filled cup are the simple yet significant symbols.

   Mr. Spurgeon had intended to publish a selection of his Communion
   Addresses; so this volume may be regarded as another of the precious
   literary legacies bequeathed by him to his brethren and sisters in
   Christ who have yet to tarry a while here below. It is hoped that these
   sermonettes will be the means of deepening the spiritual life of many
   believers, and that they will suggest suitable themes for meditation
   and discourse to those who have the privilege and responsibility of
   presiding at the ordinance.

                               MYSTERIOUS VISITS.

  AN ADDRESS TO A LITTLE COMPANY AT THE COMMUNION TABLE AT MENTONE."Thou hast
  visited me in the night."--Psalm xvii. 3.

MYSTERIOUS VISITS.

   IT is a theme for wonder that the glorious God should visit sinful man.
   "What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that
   Thou visitest him?" A divine visit is a joy to be treasured whenever we
   are favoured with it. David speaks of it with great solemnity. The
   Psalmist was not content barely to speak of it; but he wrote it down in
   plain terms, that it might be known throughout all generations: "Thou
   hast visited me in the night." Beloved, if God has ever visited you,
   you also will marvel at it, will carry it in your memory, will speak of
   it to your friends, and will record it in your diary as one of the
   notable events of your life. Above all, you will speak of it to God
   Himself, and say with adoring gratitude, "Thou hast visited me in the
   night." It should be a solemn part of worship to remember and make
   known the condescension of the Lord, and say, both in lowly prayer and
   in joyful psalm, "Thou hast visited me."

   To you, beloved friends, who gather with me about this communion table,
   I will speak of my own experience, nothing doubting that it is also
   yours. If our God has ever visited any of us, personally, by His
   Spirit, two results have attended the visit: it has been sharply
   searching, and it has been sweetly solacing.

   When first of all the Lord draws nigh to the heart, the trembling soul
   perceives clearly the searching character of His visit. Remember how
   Job answered the Lord: "I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear:
   but now mine eye seeth Thee, wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in
   dust and ashes." We can read of God, and hear of God, and be little
   moved; but when we feel His presence, it is another matter. I thought
   my house was good enough for kings; but when the King of kings came to
   it, I saw that it was a hovel quite unfit for His abode. I had never
   known sin to be so "exceeding sinful" if I had not known God to be so
   perfectly holy. I had never understood the depravity of my own nature
   if I had not known the holiness of God's nature. When we see Jesus, we
   fall at His feet as dead; till then, we are alive with vainglorious
   life. If letters of light traced by a mysterious hand upon the wall
   caused the joints of Belshazzar's loins to be loosed, what awe
   overcomes our spirits when we see the Lord Himself! In the presence of
   so much light our spots and wrinkles are revealed, and we are utterly
   ashamed. We are like Daniel, who said, "I was left alone, and saw this
   great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness
   was turned in me into corruption." It is when the Lord visits us that
   we see our nothingness, and ask, "Lord, what is man?"

   I do remember well when God first visited me; and assuredly it was the
   night of nature, of ignorance, of sin. His visit had the same effect
   upon me that it had upon Saul of Tarsus when the Lord spake to him out
   of heaven. He brought me down from the high horse, and caused me to
   fall to the ground; by the brightness of the light of His Spirit He
   made me grope in conscious blindness; and in the brokenness of my heart
   I cried, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?" I felt that I had been
   rebelling against the Lord, kicking against the pricks, and doing evil
   even as I could; and my soul was filled with anguish at the discovery.
   Very searching was the glance of the eye of Jesus, for it revealed my
   sin, and caused me to go out and weep bitterly. As when the Lord
   visited Adam, and called him to stand naked before Him, so was I
   stripped of all my righteousness before the face of the Most High. Yet
   the visit ended not there; for as the Lord God clothed our first
   parents in coats of skins, so did He cover me with the righteousness of
   the great sacrifice, and He gave me songs in the night It was night,
   but the visit was no dream: in fact, I there and then ceased to dream,
   and began to deal with the reality of things.

   I think you will remember that, when the Lord first visited you in the
   night, it was with you as with Peter when Jesus came to him. He had
   been toiling with his net all the night, and nothing had come of it;
   but when the Lord Jesus came into his boat, and bade him launch out
   into the deep, and let down his net for a draught, he caught such a
   great multitude of fishes that the boat began to sink. See! the boat
   goes down, down, till the water threatens to engulf it, and Peter, and
   the fish, and all. Then Peter fell down at Jesus knees, and cried,
   "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord!" The presence of Jesus
   was too much for him: his sense of unworthiness made him sink like his
   boat, and shrink away from the Divine Lord. I remember that sensation
   well; for I was half inclined to cry with the demoniac of Gadara, "What
   have I to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God most high?" That first
   discovery of His injured love was overpowering; its very hopefulness
   increased my anguish; for then I saw that I had slain the Lord who had
   come to save me. I saw that mine was the hand which made the hammer
   fall, and drove the nails that fastened the Redeemer's hands and feet
   to the cruel tree.

   "My conscience felt and own'd the guilt,

   And plunged me in despair;

   I saw my sins His blood had spilt,

   And help'd to nail Him there."

   This is the sight which breeds repentance: "They shall look upon Him
   whom they have pierced, and mourn for Him." When the Lord visits us, He
   humbles us, removes all hardness from our hearts, and leads us to the
   Saviour's feet.

   When the Lord first visited us in the night it was very much with us as
   with John, when the Lord visited him in the isle that is called Patmos.
   He tells us, "And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead." Yes,
   even when we begin to see that He has put away our sin, and removed our
   guilt by His death, we feel as if we could never look up again, because
   we have been so cruel to our best Friend. It is no wonder if we then
   say, "It is true that He has forgiven me; but I never can forgive
   myself. He makes me live, and I live in Him; but at the thought of His
   goodness I fall at His feet as dead. Boasting is dead, self is dead,
   and all desire for anything beyond my Lord is dead also." Well does
   Cowper sing of--

   "That dear hour, that brought me to His foot,

   And cut up all my follies by the root."

   The process of destroying follies is more hopefully performed at Jesus'
   feet than anywhere else. Oh, that the Lord would come again to us as at
   the first, and like a consuming fire discover and destroy the dross
   which now alloys our gold! The word visit brings to us who travel the
   remembrance of the government officer who searches our baggage; thus
   doth the Lord seek out our secret things. But it also reminds us of the
   visits of the physician, who not only finds out our maladies, but also
   removes them. Thus did the Lord Jesus visit us at the first.

   Since those early days, I hope that you and I have had many visits from
   our Lord. Those first visits were, as I said, sharply searching; but
   the later ones have been sweetly solacing. Some of us have had them,
   especially in the night, when we have been compelled to count the
   sleepless hours. "Heaven's gate opens when this world's is shut." The
   night is still; everybody is away; work is done; care is forgotten, and
   then the Lord Himself draws near. Possibly there may be pain to be
   endured, the head may be aching, and the heart may be throbbing; but if
   Jesus comes to visit us, our bed of languishing becomes a throne of
   glory. Though it is true "He giveth His beloved sleep," yet at such
   times He gives them something better than sleep, namely; His own
   presence, and the fulness of joy which comes with it. By night upon our
   bed we have seen the unseen. I have tried sometimes not to sleep under
   an excess of joy, when the company of Christ has been sweetly mine.

   "Thou hast visited me in the night." Believe me, there are such things
   as personal visits from Jesus to His people. He has not left us
   utterly. Though He be not seen with the bodily eye by bush or brook,
   nor on tile mount, nor by the sea, yet doth He come and go, observed
   only by the spirit, felt only by the heart. Still he standeth behind
   our wall, He showeth Himself through the lattices.

   "Jesus, these eyes have never seen

   That radiant form of Thine!

   The veil of sense hangs dark between

   Thy blessed face and mine!

   "I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,

   Yet art Thou oft with me,

   And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot

   As where I meet with Thee.

   "Like some bright dream that comes unsought,

   When slumbers o'er me roll,

   Thine image ever fills my thought,

   And charms my ravish'd soul.

   "Yet though I have not seen, and still

   Must rest in faith alone;

   I love Thee, dearest Lord! and will,

   Unseen, but not unknown."

   Do you ask me to describe these manifestations of the Lord? It were
   hard to tell you in words: you must know them for yourselves. If you
   had never tasted sweetness, no man living could give you an idea of
   honey. Yet if the honey be there, you can "taste and see." To a man
   born blind, sight must be a thing past imagination; and to one who has
   never known the Lord, His visits are quite as much beyond conception.

   For our Lord to visit us is something more than for us to have the
   assurance of our salvation, though that is very delightful, and none of
   us should rest satisfied unless we possess it. To know that Jesus loves
   me, is one thing; but to be visited by Him in love, is more.

   Nor is it simply a close contemplation of Christ; for we can picture
   Him as exceedingly fair and majestic, and yet not have Him consciously
   near us. Delightful and instructive as it is to behold the likeness of
   Christ by meditation, yet the enjoyment of His actual presence is
   something more. I may wear my friend's portrait about my person, and
   yet may not be able to say, "Thou hast visited me."

   It is the actual, though spiritual, coming of Christ which we so much
   desire. The Romish church says much about the real presence; meaning
   thereby, the corporeal presence of the Lord Jesus. The priest who
   celebrates mass tells us that he believes in the real presence, but we
   reply, "Nay, you believe in knowing Christ after the flesh, and in that
   sense the only real presence is in heaven; but we firmly believe in the
   real presence of Christ which is spiritual, and yet certain." By
   spiritual we do not mean unreal; in fact, the spiritual takes the lead
   in real-ness to spiritual men. I believe in the true and real presence
   of Jesus with His people: such presence has been real to my spirit.
   Lord Jesus, Thou Thyself hast visited me. As surely as the Lord Jesus
   came really as to His flesh to Bethlehem and Calvary, so surely does He
   come really by His Spirit to His people in the hours of their communion
   with Him. We are as conscious of that presence as of our own existence.

   When the Lord visits us in the night, what is the effect upon us? When
   hearts meet hearts in fellowship of love, communion brings first peace,
   then rest, and then joy of soul. I am speaking of no emotional
   excitement rising into fanatical rapture; but I speak of sober fact,
   when I say that the Lord's great heart touches ours, and our heart
   rises into sympathy with Him.

   First, we experience peace. All war is over, and a blessed peace is
   proclaimed; the peace of God keeps our heart and mind by Christ Jesus.

   "Peace! perfect peace! in this dark world of sin?

   The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

   "Peace! perfect peace! with sorrows surging round?

   On Jesus' bosom nought but calm is found."

   At such a time there is a delightful sense of rest; we have no
   ambitions, no desires. A divine serenity and security envelop us. We
   have no thought of foes, or fears, or afflictions, or doubts. There is
   a joyous laying aside of our own will. We are nothing, and we will
   nothing: Christ is everything, and His will is the pulse of our soul.
   We are perfectly content either to be ill or to be well, to be rich or
   to be poor, to be slandered or to be honoured, so that we may but abide
   in the love of Christ. Jesus fills the horizon of our being.

   At such a time a flood of great joy will fill our minds. We shall half
   wish that the morning may never break again, for fear its light should
   banish the superior light of Christ's presence. We shall wish that we
   could glide away with our Beloved to the place where He feedeth among
   the lilies. We long to hear the voices of the white-robed armies, that
   we may follow their glorious Leader whithersoever He goeth. I am
   persuaded that there is no great actual distance between earth and
   heaven: the distance lies in our dull minds. When the Beloved visits us
   in the night, He makes our chambers to be the vestibule of His
   palace-halls. Earth rises to heaven when heaven comes down to earth.

   Now, beloved friends, you may be saying to yourselves, "We have not
   enjoyed such visits as these." You may do so. If the Father loves you
   even as He loves His Son, then you are on visiting terms with Him. If,
   then, He has not called upon you, you will be wise to call on Him.
   Breathe a sigh to Him, and say,--

   "When wilt Thou come unto me, Lord?

   Oh come, my Lord most dear!

   Come near, come nearer, nearer still,

   I'm blest when Thou art near.

   "When wilt Thou come unto me, Lord?

   I languish for the sight;

   Ten thousand suns when Thou art hid,

   Are shades instead of light.

   "When wilt Thou come unto me, Lord?

   Until Thou dost appear,

   I count each moment for a day,

   Each minute for a year."

   "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after
   Thee, O God!" If you long for Him, He much more longs for you. Never
   was there a sinner that was half so eager for Christ as Christ is eager
   for the sinner; nor a saint one-tenth so anxious to behold his Lord as
   his Lord is to behold him. If thou art running to Christ, He is already
   near thee. If thou dost sigh for His presence, that sigh is the
   evidence that He is with thee. He is with thee now: therefore be calmly
   glad.

   Go forth, beloved, and talk with Jesus on the beach, for He oft
   resorted to the sea-shore. Commune with Him amid the olive-groves so
   dear to Him in many a night of wrestling prayer. If ever there was a
   country in which men should see traces of Jesus, next to the Holy Land,
   this Riviera is the favoured spot. It is a land of vines, and figs, and
   olives, and palms; I have called it "Thy land, O Immanuel." While in
   this Mentone, I often fancy that I am looking out upon the Lake of
   Gennesaret, or walking at the foot of the Mount of Olives, or peering
   into the mysterious gloom of the Garden of Gethsemane. The narrow
   streets of the old town are such as Jesus traversed, these villages are
   such as He inhabited. Have your hearts right with Him, and He will
   visit you often, until every day you shall walk with God, as Enoch did,
   and so turn week-days into Sabbaths, meals into sacraments, homes into
   temples, and earth into heaven. So be it with us! Amen.

                               UNDER HIS SHADOW.

  A BRIEF SACRAMENTAL DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT MENTONE

  TO ABOUT A SCORE BRETHREN. "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most
  High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty."--Psalm xci. 1.

UNDER HIS SHADOW.

   I MUST confess of my short discourse, as the man did of the axe which
   fell into the stream, that it is borrowed. The outline of it is taken
   from one who will never complain of me, for to the great loss of the
   Church she has left these lower choirs to sing above. Miss Havergal,
   last and loveliest of our modern poets, when her tones were most
   mellow, and her language most sublime, has been caught up to swell the
   music of heaven. Her last poems are published with the title, "Under
   His Shadow," and the preface gives the reason for the name. She said,
   "I should like the title to be, Under His Shadow.' I seem to see four
   pictures suggested by that: under the shadow of a rock, in a weary
   plain; under the shadow of a tree; closer still, under the shadow of
   His wing; nearest and closest, in the shadow of His hand. Surely that
   hand must be the pierced hand, that may oftentimes press us sorely, and
   yet evermore encircling, upholding, and shadowing."

   "Under His Shadow," is our afternoon subject, and we will in a few
   words enlarge on the Scriptural plan which Miss Havergal has bequeathed
   to us. Our text is, "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most
   High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty." The shadow of God
   is not the occasional resort, but the constant abiding-place, of the
   saint. Here we find not only our consolation, but our habitation. We
   ought never to be out of the shadow of God. It is to dwellers, not to
   visitors, that the Lord promises His protection. "He that dwelleth in
   the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the
   Almighty:" and that shadow shall preserve him from nightly terror and
   ghostly ill, from the arrows of war and of pestilence, from death and
   from destruction. Guarded by Omnipotence, the chosen of the Lord are
   always safe; for as they dwell in the holy place, hard by the
   mercy-seat, where the blood was sprinkled of old, the pillar of fire by
   night, the pillar of cloud by day, which ever hangs over the sanctuary,
   covers them also. Is it not written, "In the time of trouble He shall
   hide me in His pavilion, in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide
   me"? What better security can we desire? As the people of God, we are
   always under the protection of the Most High. Wherever we go, whatever
   we suffer, whatever may be our difficulties, temptations, trials, or
   perplexities, we are always "under the shadow of the Almighty." Over
   all who maintain their fellowship with God the most tender guardian
   care is extended. Their heavenly Father Himself interposes between them
   and their adversaries. The experience of the saints, albeit they are
   all under the shadow, yet differs as to the form in which that
   protection has been enjoyed by them, hence the value of the four
   figures which will now engage our attention.

   I. We will begin with the first picture which Miss Havergal mentions,
   namely, the rock sheltering the weary traveller:--"The shadow of a
   great rock in a weary land" (Isaiah xxxii. 2).

   Now, I take it that this is where we begin to know our Lord's shadow.
   He was at the first to us a refuge in time of trouble. Weary was the
   way, and great was the heat; our lips were parched, and our souls were
   fainting; we sought for shelter, and we found none; for we were in the
   wilderness of sin and condemnation, and who could bring us deliverance,
   or even hope? Then we cried unto the Lord in our trouble, and He led us
   to the Rock of ages, which of old was cleft for us. We saw our
   interposing Mediator coming between us and the fierce heat of justice,
   and we hailed the blessed screen. The Lord Jesus was unto us a covering
   for sin, and so a covert from wrath. The sense of divine displeasure,
   which had beaten upon our conscience, was removed by the removal of the
   sin itself, which we saw to be laid on Jesus, who in our place and
   stead endured its penalty.

   The shadow of a rock is remarkably cooling, and so was the Lord Jesus
   eminently comforting to us. The shadow of a rock is more dense, more
   complete, and more cool than any other shade; and so the peace which
   Jesus gives passeth all understanding, there is none like it. No chance
   beam darts through the rock-shade, nor can the heat penetrate as it
   will do in a measure through the foliage of a forest. Jesus is a
   complete shelter, and blessed are they who are "under His shadow." Let
   them take care that they abide there, and never venture forth to answer
   for themselves, or to brave the accusations of Satan.

   As with sin, so with sorrow of every sort: the Lord is the Rock of our
   refuge. No sun shall smite us, nor, any heat, because we are never out
   of Christ. The saints know where to fly, and they use their privilege.

   "When troubles, like a burning sun,

   Beat heavy on their head,

   To Christ their mighty Rock they run,

   And find a pleasing shade."

   There is, however, something of awe about this great shadow. A rock is
   often so high as to be terrible, and we tremble in presence of its
   greatness. The idea of littleness hiding behind massive greatness is
   well set forth; but there is no tender thought of fellowship, or
   gentleness: even so, at the first, we view the Lord Jesus as our
   shelter from the consuming heat of well-deserved punishment, and we
   know little more. It is most pleasant to remember that this is only one
   panel of the four-fold picture. Inexpressibly dear to my soul is the
   deep cool rock-shade of my blessed Lord, as I stand in Him a sinner
   saved; yet is there more.

   II. Our second picture, that of the tree, is to be found in the Song of
   Solomon ii. 3: "As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
   Beloved among the sons. I sat down under His shadow with great delight,
   and His fruit was sweet to my taste." Here we have not so much refuge
   from trouble as special rest in times of joy. The spouse is happily
   wandering through a wood, glancing at many trees, and rejoicing in the
   music of the birds. One tree specially charms her: the citron with its
   golden fruit wins her admiration, and she sits under its shadow with
   great delight; such was her Beloved to her, the best among the good,
   the fairest of the fair, the joy of her joy, the light of her delight.
   Such is Jesus to the believing soul.

   The sweet influences of Christ are intended to give us a happy rest,
   and we ought to avail ourselves of them; "I sat down under His shadow."
   This was Mary's better part, which Martha well-nigh missed by being
   cumbered. That is the good old way wherein we are to walk, the way in
   which we find rest unto our souls. Papists and papistical persons,
   whose religion is all ceremonies, or all working, or all groaning, or
   all feeling, have never come to an end. We may say of their religion as
   of the law, that it made nothing perfect; but under the gospel there is
   something finished, and that something is the sum and substance of our
   salvation, and therefore there is rest for us, and we ought to sing, "I
   sat down."

   Dear friends, is Christ to each one of us a place of sitting down? I do
   not mean a rest of idleness and self-content,--God deliver us from
   that; but there is rest in a conscious grasp of Christ, a rest of
   contentment with Him as our all in all. God give us to know more of
   this! This shadow is also meant to yield perpetual solace, for the
   spouse did not merely come under it, but there she sat down as one who
   meant to stay. Continuance of repose and joy is purchased for us by our
   Lord's perfected work. Under the shadow she found food; she had no need
   to leave it to find a single needful thing, for the tree which shaded
   also yielded fruit; nor did she need even to rise from her rest, but
   sitting still she feasted on the delicious fruit. You who know the Lord
   Jesus know also what this meaneth.

   The spouse never wished to go beyond her Lord. She knew no higher life
   than that of sitting under the Well-beloved's shadow. She passed the
   cedar, and oak, and every other goodly tree, but the apple-tree held
   her, and there she sat down. "Many there be that say, who will show us
   any good? But as for us, O Lord, our heart is fixed, our heart is
   fixed, resting on Thee. We will go no further, for Thou art our
   dwelling-place, we feel at home with Thee, and sit down beneath Thy
   shadow." Some Christians cultivate reverence at the expense of
   childlike love; they kneel down, but they dare not sit down. Our Divine
   Friend and Lover wills not that it should be so; He would not have us
   stand on ceremony with Him, but come boldly unto Him.

   "Let us be simple with Him, then,

   Not backward, stiff or cold,

   As though our Bethlehem could be

   What Sinai was of old."

   Let us use His sacred name as a common word, as a household word, and
   run to Him as to a dear familiar friend. Under His shadow we are to
   feel that we are at home, and then He will make Himself at home to us
   by becoming food unto our souls, and giving spiritual refreshment to us
   while we rest. The spouse does not here say that she reached up to the
   tree to gather its fruit, but she sat down on the ground in intense
   delight, and the fruit came to her where she sat. It is wonderful how
   Christ will come down to souls that sit beneath His shadow; if we can
   but be at home with Christ, He will sweetly commune with us. Has He not
   said, "Delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the
   desires of thine heart"?

   In this second form of the sacred shadow, the sense of awe gives place
   to that of restful delight in Christ. Have you ever figured in such a
   scene as the sitter beneath the grateful shade of the fruitful tree?
   Have you not only possessed security, but experienced delight in
   Christ? Have you sung,--

   "I sat down under His shadow,

   Sat down with great delight;

   His fruit was sweet unto my taste,

   And pleasant to my sight"?

   This is as necessary an experience as it is joyful: necessary for many
   uses. The joy of the Lord is our strength, and it is when we delight
   ourselves in the Lord that we have assurance of power in prayer. Here
   faith develops, and hope grows bright, while love sheds abroad all the
   fragrance of her sweet spices. Oh! get you to the apple-tree, and find
   out who is the fairest among the fair. Make the Light of heaven the
   delight of your heart, and then be filled with heart's-ease, and revel
   in complete content.

   III. The third view of the one subject is,--the shadow of his wings,--a
   precious word. I think the best specimen of it, for it occurs several
   times, is in that blessed Psalm, the sixty-third, verse seven:--

   "Because Thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of Thy wings
   will I rejoice."

   Does not this set forth our Lord as our trust in hours of depression?
   In the Psalm now open before us, David was banished from the means of
   grace to a dry and thirsty land, where no water was. What is much
   worse, he was in a measure away from all conscious enjoyment of God. He
   says, "Early will I seek Thee. My soul thirsteth for Thee." He sings
   rather of memories than of present communion with God. We also have
   come into this condition, and have been unable to find any present
   comfort. "Thou hast been my help," has been the highest note we could
   strike, and we have been glad to reach to that. At such times, the
   light of God's face has been withdrawn, but our faith has taught us to
   rejoice under the shadow of His wings. Light there was none; we were
   altogether in the shade, but it was a warm shade. We felt that God who
   had been near must be near us still, and therefore we were quieted. Our
   God cannot change, and therefore as He was our help He must still be
   our help, our help even though He casts a shadow over us, for it must
   be the shadow of His own eternal wings. The metaphor is, of course,
   derived from the nestling of little birds under the shadow of their
   mother's wings, and the picture is singularly touching and comforting.
   The little bird is not yet able to take care of itself, so it cowers
   down under the mother, and is there happy and safe. Disturb a hen for a
   moment, and you will see all the little chickens huddling together, and
   by their chirps making a kind of song. Then they push their heads into
   her feathers, and seem happy beyond measure in their warm abode. When
   we are very sick and sore depressed, when we are worried with the care
   of pining children, and the troubles of a needy household, and the
   temptations of Satan, how comforting it is to run to our God,--like the
   little chicks run to the hen,--and hide away near His heart, beneath
   His Wings. Oh, tried ones, press closely to the loving heart of your
   Lord, hide yourselves entirely beneath His wings! Here awe has
   disappeared, and rest itself is enhanced by the idea of loving trust.
   The little birds are safe in their mother's love, and we, too, are
   beyond measure secure and happy in the loving favour of the Lord.

   IV. The last form of the shadow is that of the hand, and this, it seems
   to me, points to power and position in service. Turn to Isaiah xlix.
   2:--"And He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His
   hand hath He hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in His quiver hath
   He hid me." This undoubtedly refers to the Saviour, for the passage
   proceeds:--"And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
   will be glorified. Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent
   my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the
   Lord, and my work with my God. And now, saith the Lord that formed me
   from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, though
   Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the
   Lord, and my God shall be my strength. And He said, It is a light thing
   that thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and
   to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light
   to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the
   earth." Our Lord Jesus Christ was hidden away in the hand of Jehovah,
   to be used by Him as a polished shaft for the overthrow of His enemies,
   and the victory of His people. Yet, inasmuch as it is Christ, it is
   also all Christ's servants, since as He is so are we also in this
   world; and to make quite sure of it, we have the same expression in the
   sixteenth verse of the fifty-first chapter, where, speaking of His
   people, He says, "I have covered thee in the shadow of Mine hand." Is
   not this an excellent minister's text? Every one of you who will speak
   a word for Jesus shall have a share in it. This is where those who are
   workers for Christ should long to be,--"in the shadow of His hand," to
   achieve His eternal purpose. What are any of God's servants without
   their Lord but weapons out of the warrior's hand, having no power to do
   anything? We ought to be as the arrows of the Lord which He shoots at
   His enemies; and so great is His hand of power, and so little are we as
   His instruments, that He hides us away in the hollow of His hand,
   unseen until He darts us forth. As workers, we are to be hidden away in
   the hand of God, or to quote the other figure, "in His quiver hath He
   hid me:" we are to be unseen till He uses us. It is impossible for us
   not to be known somewhat if the Lord uses us, but we may not aim at
   being noticed, but, on the contrary, if we be as much used as the very
   chief of the apostles, we must truthfully add, "though I be nothing."
   Our desire should be that Christ should be glorified, and that self
   should be concealed. Alas! there is a way of always showing self in
   what we do, and we are all too ready to fall into it. You can visit the
   poor in such a way that they will feel that his lordship or her
   ladyship has condescended to call upon poor Betsy; but there is another
   way of doing the same thing so that the tried child of God shall know
   that a brother beloved or a dear sister in Christ has shown a
   fellow-feeling for her, and has talked to her heart. There is a way of
   preaching, in which a great divine has evidently displayed his vast
   learning and talent; and there is another way of preaching, in which a
   faithful servant of Jesus Christ, depending upon his Lord, has spoken
   in his Master's name, and left a rich unction behind. Within the hand
   of God is the place of acceptance, and safety; and for service it is
   the place of power, as well as of concealment. God only works with
   those who are in His hand; and the more we lie hidden there, the more
   surely will He use us ere long. May the Lord do unto us according to
   His word, "I have put My words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in
   the shadow of My hand." In this case we shall feel all the former
   emotions combined: awe that the Lord should condescend to take us into
   His hand, rest and delight that He should deign to use us, trust that
   out of weakness we shall now be made strong, and to this will be added
   an absolute assurance that the end of our being must be answered, for
   that which is urged onward by the Almighty hand cannot miss its mark.

   These are mere surface thoughts. The subject deserves a series of
   discourses. Your best course, my beloved friends, will be to enlarge
   upon these hints by a long personal experience of abiding under the
   shadow of the Almighty. May God the Holy Ghost lead you into it, and
   keep you there, for Jesus' sake!
     __________________________________________________________________

 UNDER THE APPLE TREE."I sat down under His shadow with great delight, and His
             fruit was sweet to my taste."--Song of Solomon ii. 3.

UNDER THE APPLE TREE.

   Christ known should be Christ used. The spouse knew her Beloved to be
   like a fruit-bearing tree, and at once she sat under His shadow, and
   fed upon His fruit. It is a pity that we know so much about Christ, and
   yet enjoy Him so little. May our experience keep pace with our
   knowledge, and may that experience be composed of a practical using of
   our Lord! Jesus casts a shadow, let us sit under it: Jesus yields
   fruit, let us taste the sweetness of it. Depend upon it that the way to
   learn more is to use what you know; and, moreover, the way to learn a
   truth thoroughly is to learn it experimentally. You know a doctrine
   beyond all fear of contradiction when you have proved it for yourself
   by personal test and trial. The bride in the song as good as says, "I
   am certain that my Beloved casts a shadow, for I have sat under it, and
   I am persuaded that He bears sweet fruit, for I have tasted of it." The
   best way of demonstrating the power of Christ to save is to trust in
   Him and be saved yourself; and of all those who are sure of the
   divinity of our holy faith, there are none so certain as those who feel
   its divine power upon themselves. You may reason yourself into a belief
   of the gospel, and you may by further reasoning keep yourself orthodox;
   but a personal trial, and an inward knowing of the truth, are
   incomparably the best evidences. If Jesus be as an apple tree among the
   trees of the wood, do not keep away from Him, but sit under His shadow,
   and taste His fruit. He is a Saviour; do not believe the fact and yet
   remain unsaved. As far as Christ is known to you, so far make use of
   Him. Is not this sound common-sense?

   We would further remark that we are at liberty to make every possible
   use of Christ. Shadow and fruit may both be enjoyed. Christ in His
   infinite condescension exists for needy souls. Oh, let us say it over
   again: it is a bold word, but it is true,--as Christ Jesus, our Lord
   exists for the benefit of His people. A Saviour only exists to save. A
   physician lives to heal. The Good Shepherd lives, yea, dies, for His
   sheep. Our Lord Jesus Christ hath wrapped us about His heart; we are
   intimately interwoven with all His offices, with all His honours, with
   all His traits of character, with all that He has done, and with all
   that He has yet to do. The sinners' Friend lives for sinners, and
   sinners may have Him and use Him to the uttermost. He is as free to us
   as the air we breathe. What are fountains for, but that the thirsty may
   drink? What is the harbour for but that storm-tossed barques may there
   find refuge? What is Christ for but that poor guilty ones like
   ourselves may come to Him and look and live, and afterwards may have
   all our needs supplied out of His fulness?

   We have thus the door set open for us, and we pray that the Holy Spirit
   may help us to enter in while we notice in the text two things which we
   pray that you may enjoy to the full. First, the heart's rest in Christ:
   "I sat down under His shadow with great delight." And, secondly, the
   heart's refreshment in Christ: "His fruit was sweet to my taste."

   I. To begin with, we have here the heart's rest in Christ. To set this
   forth, let us notice the character of the person who uttered this
   sentence. She who said, "I sat down under His shadow with great
   delight," was one who had known before what weary travel meant, and
   therefore valued rest; for the man who has never laboured knows nothing
   of the sweetness of repose. The loafer who has eaten bread he never
   earned, from whose brow there never oozed a drop of honest sweat, does
   not deserve rest, and knows not what it is. It is to the labouring man
   that rest is sweet; and when at last we come, toil-worn with many miles
   of weary plodding, to a shaded place where we may comfortably sit down,
   then are we filled with delight.

   The spouse had been seeking her Beloved, and in looking for Him she had
   asked where she was likely to find Him. "Tell me," says she, "O Thou
   whom my soul loveth, where Thou feedest, where Thou makest Thy flock to
   rest at noon." The answer was given to her, "Go thy way forth by the
   footsteps of the flock." She did go her way; but, after a while, she
   came to this resolution: "I will sit down under His shadow."

   Many of you have been sorely wearied with going your way to find peace.
   Some of you tried ceremonies, and trusted in them, and the priest came
   to your help; but he mocked your heart's distress. Others of you sought
   by various systems of thought to come to an anchorage; but, tossed from
   billow to billow, you found no rest upon the seething sea of
   speculation. More of you tried by your good works to gain rest to your
   consciences. You multiplied your prayers, you poured out floods of
   tears, you hoped, by almsgiving and by the like, that some merit might
   accrue to you, and that your heart might feel acceptance with God, and
   so have rest. You toiled and toiled, like the men that were in the
   vessel with Jonah when they rowed hard to bring their ship to land, but
   could not, for the sea wrought and was tempestuous. There was no escape
   for you that way, and so you were driven to another way, even to rest
   in Jesus. My heart looks back to the time when I was under a sense of
   sin, and sought with all my soul to find peace, but could not discover
   it, high or low, in any place beneath the sky; yet when "I saw one
   hanging on a tree," as the Substitute for sin, then my heart sat down
   under His shadow with great delight. My heart reasoned thus with
   herself,--Did Jesus suffer in my stead? Then I shall not suffer. Did He
   bear my sin? Then I do not bear it. Did God accept His Son as my
   Substitute? Then He will never smite me. Was Jesus acceptable with God
   as my Sacrifice? Then what contents the Lord may well enough content
   me, and so I will go no farther, but: "sit down under His shadow," and
   enjoy a delightful rest.

   She who said, "I sat down under His shadow with great delight," could
   appreciate shade, for she had been sunburnt. Did we not read just now
   her exclamation,--"Look not upon me, for I am black, because the sun
   hath looked upon me"? She knew what heat meant, what the burning sun
   meant; and therefore shade was pleasant to her. You know nothing about
   the deliciousness of shade till you travel in a thoroughly hot country;
   then you are delighted with it. Did you ever feel the heat of divine
   wrath? Did the great Sun--that Sun without variableness or shadow of a
   turning--ever dart upon you His hottest rays,--the rays of his holiness
   and justice? Did you cower down beneath the scorching beams of that
   great Light, and say, "We are consumed by Thine anger"? If you have
   ever felt that, you have found it a very blessed thing to come under
   the shadow of Christ's atoning sacrifice. A shadow, you know, is cast
   by a body coming between us and the light and heat; and our Lord's most
   blessed body has come between us and the scorching sun of divine
   justice, so that we sit under the shadow of His mediation with great
   delight.

   And now, if any other sun begins to scorch us, we fly to our Lord. If
   domestic trouble, or business care, or Satanic temptation, or inward
   corruption, oppresses us, we hasten to Jesus' shadow, to hide under
   Him, and there "sit down" in the cool refreshment with great delight.
   The interposition of our blessed Lord is the cause of our inward quiet.
   The sun cannot scorch me, for it scorched Him. My troubles need not
   trouble me, for He has taken my trouble, and I have left it in His
   hands. "I sat down under His shadow."

   Mark well these two things concerning the spouse. She knew what it was
   to be weary, and she knew what it was to be sunburnt; and just in
   proportion as you also know these two things, your valuation of Christ
   will rise. You who have never pined under the wrath of God have never
   prized the Saviour. Water is of small value in this land of brooks and
   rivers, and so you commonly sprinkle the roads with it; but I warrant
   you that, if you were making a day's march over burning sand, a cup of
   cold water would be worth a king's ransom; and so to thirsty souls
   Christ is precious, but to none beside.

   Now, when the spouse was sitting down, restful and delighted, she was
   overshadowed. She says, "I sat down under His shadow." I do not know a
   more delightful state of mind than to feel quite overshadowed by our
   beloved Lord. Here is my black sin, but there is His precious blood
   overshadowing my sin, and hiding it for ever. Here is my condition by
   nature, an enemy to God; but He who reconciled me to God by His blood
   has overshadowed that also, so that I forget that I was once an enemy
   in the joy of being now a friend. I am very weak; but He is strong, and
   His strength overshadows my feebleness. I am very poor; but He hath all
   riches, and His riches overshadow my poverty. I am most unworthy; but
   He is so worthy that if I use His name I shall receive as much as if I
   were worthy: His worthiness doth overshadow my unworthiness. It is very
   precious to put the truth the other way, and say, If there be anything
   good in me, it is not good when I compare myself with Him, for His
   goodness quite eclipses and overshadows it. Can I say I love Him? So I
   do, but I hardly dare call it love, for His love overshadows it. Did I
   suppose that I served Him? So I would; but my poor service is not worth
   mentioning in comparison with what He has done for me. Did I think I
   had any degree of holiness? I must not deny what His Spirit works in
   me; but when I think of His immaculate life, and all His divine
   perfections, where am I? What am I? Have you not sometimes felt this?
   Have you not been so overshadowed and hidden under your Lord that you
   became as nothing? I know myself what it is to feel that if I die in a
   workhouse it does not matter so long as my Lord is glorified. Mortals
   may cast out my name as evil, if they like; but what matters it since
   His dear name shall one day be printed in stars athwart the sky? Let
   Him overshadow me; I delight that it should be so.

   The spouse tells us that, when she became quite overshadowed, then she
   felt great delight. Great "I" never has great delight, for it cannot
   bear to own a greater than itself, but the humble believer finds his
   delight in being overshadowed by his Lord. In the shade of Jesus we
   have more delight than in any fancied light of our own. The spouse had
   great delight. I trust that you Christian people do have great delight;
   and if not, you ought to ask yourselves whether you really are the
   people of God. I like to see a cheerful countenance; ay, and to hear of
   raptures in the hearts of those who are God's saints! There are people
   who seem to think that religion and gloom are married, and must never
   be divorced. Pull down the blinds on Sunday, and darken the rooms; if
   you have a garden, or a rose in flower, try to forget that there are
   such beauties: are you not to serve God as dolorously as you can? Put
   your book under your arm, and crawl to your place of worship in as
   mournful a manner as if you were being marched to the whipping-post.
   Act thus if you will; but give me that religion which cheers my heart,
   fires my soul, and fills me with enthusiasm and delight,--for that is
   likely to be the religion of heaven, and it agrees with the experience
   of the Inspired Song.

   Although I trust that we know what delight means, I question if we have
   enough of it to describe ourselves as sitting down in the enjoyment of
   it. Do you give yourselves enough time to sit at Jesus' feet? There is
   the place of delight, do you abide in it? Sit down under His shadow. "I
   have no leisure," cries one. Try and make a little. Steal it from your
   sleep if you cannot get it anyhow else. Grant leisure to your heart. It
   would be a great pity if a man never spent five minutes with his wife,
   but was forced to be always hard at work. Why, that is slavery, is it
   not? Shall we not then have time to commune with our Best-beloved?
   Surely, somehow or other, we can squeeze out a little season in which
   we shall have nothing else to do but to sit down under His shadow with
   great delight! When I take my Bible, and want to feed on it for myself,
   I generally get thinking about preaching upon the text, and what I
   should say to you from it. This will not do; I must get away from that,
   and forget that there is a Tabernacle, that I may sit personally at
   Jesus' feet. And, oh, there is an intense delight in being overshadowed
   by Him! He is near you, and you know it. His dear presence is as
   certainly with you as if you could see Him, for His influence surrounds
   you.

   Often have I felt as if Jesus leaned over me, as a friend might look
   over my shoulder. Although no cool shade comes over your brow, yet you
   may as much feel His shadow as if it did, for your heart grows calm;
   and if you have been wearied with the family, or troubled with the
   church, or vexed with yourself, you come down from the chamber where
   you have seen your Lord, and you feel braced for the battle of life,
   ready for its troubles and its temptations, because you have seen the
   Lord. "I sat down" said she, "under His shadow with great delight." How
   great that delight was she could not tell, but she sat down as one
   overpowered with it, needing to sit still under the load of bliss. I do
   not like to talk much about the secret delights of Christians, because
   there are always some around us who do not understand our meaning; but
   I will venture to say this much--that if worldlings could but even
   guess what are the secret joys of believers, they would give their eyes
   to share with us. We have troubles, and we admit it, we expect to have
   them; but we have joys which are frequently excessive. We should not
   like that others should be witnesses of the delight which now and then
   tosses our soul into a very tempest of joy. You know what it means, do
   you not? When you have been quite alone with the heavenly Bridegroom,
   you wanted to tell the angels of the sweet love of Christ to you, a
   poor unworthy one. You even wished to teach the golden harps fresh
   music, for seraphs know not the heights and depths of the grace of God
   as you know them.

   The spouse had great delight, and we know that she had, for this one
   reason, that she did not forget it. This verse and the whole Song are a
   remembrance of what she had enjoyed. She says, "I sat down under His
   shadow." It may have been a month, it may have been years ago; but she
   had not forgotten it. The joys of fellowship with God are written in
   marble. "Engraved as in eternal brass" are memories of communion with
   Christ Jesus. "Above fourteen years ago," says the apostle, "I knew a
   man." Ah, it was worth remembering all those years! He had not told his
   delight, but he had kept it stored up. He says, "I knew a man in Christ
   above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or
   whether out of the body, I cannot tell:)" so great had his delights
   been. When we look back, we forget birthdays, holidays, and
   bonfire-nights which we have spent after the manner of men, but we
   readily recall our times of fellowship with the Well-beloved. We have
   known our Tabors, our times of transfiguration fellowship, and like
   Peter we remember when we were "with Him in the holy mount." Our head
   has leaned upon the Master's bosom, and we can never forget the intense
   delight; nor will we fail to put on record for the good of others the
   joys with which we have been indulged.

   Now I leave this first part of the subject, only noticing how
   beautifully natural it is. There was a tree, and she sat down under the
   shadow: there was nothing strained, nothing formal. So ought true piety
   ever to be consistent with common-sense, with that which seems most
   fitting, most comely, most wise, and most natural. There is Christ, we
   may enjoy Him, let us not despise the privilege.

   II. The second part of our subject is, the heart's refreshment in
   Christ. His fruit was sweet to my taste. Here I will not enlarge, but
   give you thoughts in brief which you can beat out afterwards. She did
   not feast upon the fruit of the tree till first she was under the
   shadow of it. There is no knowing the excellent things of Christ till
   you trust Him. Not a single sweet apple shall fall to the lot of those
   who are outside the shadow. Come and trust Christ, and then all that
   there is in Christ shall be enjoyed by you. O unbelievers, what you
   miss! If you will but sit down under His shadow, you shall have all
   things; but if you will not, neither shall any good thing of Christ's
   be yours.

   But as soon as ever she was under the shadow, then the fruit was all
   hers. "I sat down under His shadow," saith she, and then, "His fruit
   was sweet to my taste." Dost thou believe in Jesus, friend? Then Jesus
   Christ Himself is thine; and if thou dost own the tree, thou mayest
   well eat the fruit. Since He Himself becomes thine altogether, then His
   redemption and the pardon that comes of it, His living power, His
   mighty intercession, the glories of His Second Advent, and all that
   belong to Him are made over to thee for thy personal and present use
   and enjoyment. All things are yours, since Christ is yours. Only mind
   you imitate the spouse: when she found that the fruit was hers, she ate
   it. Copy her closely in this. It is a great fault in many believers,
   that they do not appropriate the promises, and feed on them. Do not err
   as they do. Under the shadow you have a right to eat the fruit. Deny
   not yourselves the sacred entertainment.

   Now, it would appear, as we read the text, that she obtained this fruit
   without effort. The proverb says, "He who would gain the fruit must
   climb the tree." But she did not climb, for she says, "I sat down under
   His shadow." I suppose the fruit dropped down to her. I know that it is
   so with us. We no longer spend our money for that which is not bread,
   and our labour for that which satisfieth not; but we sit under our
   Lord's shadow, and we eat that which is good, and our soul delights
   itself in sweetness. Come Christian, enter into the calm rest of faith,
   by sitting down beneath the cross, and thou shalt be fed even to the
   full.

   The spouse rested while feasting: she sat and ate. So, O true believer,
   rest whilst thou art feeding upon Christ! The spouse says, "I sat, and
   I ate." Had she not told us in the former chapter that the King sat at
   His table? See how like the Church is to her Lord, and the believer to
   his Saviour! We sit down also, and we eat, even as the King doth. Right
   royally are we entertained. His joy is in us, and His peace keeps our
   hearts and minds.

   Further, notice that, as the spouse fed upon this fruit, she had a
   relish for it. It is not every palate that likes every fruit. Never
   dispute with other people about tastes of any sort, for agreement is
   not possible. That dainty which to one person is the most delicious is
   to another nauseous; and if there were a competition as to which fruit
   is preferable to all the rest, there would probably be almost as many
   opinions as there are fruits. But blessed is he who hath a relish for
   Christ Jesus! Dear hearer, is He sweet to you? Then He is yours. There
   never was a heart that did relish Christ but what Christ belonged to
   that heart. If thou hast been feeding on Him, and He is sweet to thee,
   go on feasting, for He who gave thee a relish gives thee Himself to
   satisfy thine appetite.

   What are the fruits which come from Christ? Are they not peace with
   God, renewal of heart, joy in the Holy Ghost, love to the brethren? Are
   they not regeneration, justification, sanctification, adoption, and all
   the blessings of the covenant of grace? And are they not each and all
   sweet to our taste? As we have fed upon them, have we not said, "Yes,
   these things are pleasant indeed. There is none like them. Let us live
   upon them evermore"? Now, sit down, sit down and feed. It seems a
   strange thing that we should have to persuade people to do that, but in
   the spiritual world things are very different from what they are in the
   natural. In the case of most men, if you put a joint of meat before
   them, and a knife and fork, they do not need many arguments to persuade
   them to fall to. But I will tell you when they will not do it, and that
   is when they are full: and I will also tell you when they will do it,
   and that is when they are hungry. Even so, if thy soul is weary after
   Christ the Saviour, thou wilt feed on Him; but if not, it is useless
   for me to preach to thee, or bid thee come. However, thou that art
   there, sitting under His shadow, thou mayest hear Him utter these
   words: "Eat, O friend: drink, yea, drink abundantly." Thou canst not
   have too much of these good things: the more of Christ, the better the
   Christian.

   We know that the spouse feasted herself right heartily with this food
   from the tree of life, for in after days she wanted more. Will you
   kindly read on in the fourth verse? The verse which contains our text
   describes, as it were, her first love to her Lord, her country love,
   her rustic love. She went to the wood, and she found Him there like an
   apple tree, and she enjoyed Him as one relishes a ripe apple in the
   country. But she grew in grace, she learned more of her Lord, and she
   found that her Best-beloved was a King. I should not wonder but what
   she learned the doctrine of the Second Advent, for then she began to
   sing, "He brought me to the banqueting house." As much as to say,--He
   did not merely let me know Him out in the fields as the Christ in His
   humiliation, but He brought me into the royal palace; and, since He is
   a King, He brought forth a banner with His own brave escutcheon, and He
   waved it over me while I was sitting at the table, and the motto of
   that banneret was love.

   She grew very full of this. It was such a grand thing to find a great
   Saviour, a triumphant Saviour, an exalted Saviour! But it was too much
   for her, and she became sick of soul with the excessive glory of what
   she had learned; and do you see what her heart craves for? She longs
   for her first simple joys, those countrified delights. "Comfort me with
   apples," she says. Nothing but the old joys will revive her. Did you
   ever feel like that? I have been satiated with delight in the love of
   Christ as a glorious exalted Saviour when I have seen Him riding on His
   white horse, and going forth conquering and to conquer; I have been
   overwhelmed when I have beheld Him in the midst of the throne, with all
   the brilliant assembly of angels and archangels adoring Him, and my
   thought has gone forward to the day when He shall descend with all the
   pomp of God, and make all kings and princes shrink into nothingness
   before the infinite majesty of His glory. Then I have felt as though,
   at the sight of Him, I must fall at His feet as dead; and I have wanted
   somebody to come and tell me over again "the old, old story" of how He
   died in order that I might be saved. His throne overpowers me, let me
   gather fruit from His cross. Bring me apples from "the tree" again. I
   am awe-struck while in the palace, let me get away to the woods again.
   Give me an apple plucked from the tree, such as I have given out to
   boys and girls in His family, such an apple as this, "Come unto Me all
   ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Or this:
   "This man receiveth sinners." Give me a promise from the basket of the
   covenant. Give me the simplicity of Christ, let me be a child and feast
   on apples again, if Jesus be the apple tree. I would fain go back to
   Christ on the tree in my stead, Christ overshadowing me, Christ feeding
   me. This is the happiest state to live in. Lord, evermore give us these
   apples! You recollect the old story we told, years ago, of Jack the
   huckster who used to sing,--

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all,

   But Jesus Christ is my all in all."

   Those who knew him were astonished at his constant composure. They had
   a world of doubts and fears, and so they asked him why he never
   doubted. "Well," said he, "I can't doubt but what I am a poor sinner,
   and nothing at all, for I know that, and feel it every day. And why
   should I doubt that Jesus Christ is my all in all? for He says He is."
   "Oh!" said his questioner, "I have my ups and downs." "I don't," says
   Jack;" I can never go up, for I am a poor sinner, and nothing at all;
   and I cannot go down, for Jesus Christ is my all in all." He wanted to
   join the church, and they said he must tell his experience. He said,
   "All my experience is that I am a poor sinner, and nothing at all, and
   Jesus Christ is my all in all." "Well," they said, "when you come
   before the church-meeting, the minister may ask you questions." "I
   can't help it," said Jack, "all I know I will tell you; and that is all
   I know,--

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all,

   But Jesus Christ is my all in all.'"

   He was admitted into the church, and continued with the brethren,
   walking in holiness; but that was still all his experience, and you
   could not get him beyond it. "Why," said one brother, "I sometimes feel
   so full of grace, I feel so advanced in sanctification, that I begin to
   be very happy." "I never do," said Jack; "I am a poor sinner, and
   nothing at all." "But then," said the other, "I go down again, and
   think I am not saved, because I am not as sanctified as I used to be."
   "But I never doubt my salvation," said Jack, "because Jesus Christ is
   my all in all, and He never alters." That simple story is grandly
   instructive, for it sets forth a plain man's faith in a plain
   salvation; it is the likeness of a soul under the apple tree, resting
   in the shade, and feasting on the fruit.

   Now, at this time I want you to think of Jesus, not as a Prince, but as
   an apple tree; and when this is done, I pray you to sit down under His
   shadow. It is not much to do. Any child, when it is hot, can sit down
   in a shadow. I want you next to feed on Jesus: any simpleton can eat
   apples when they are ripe upon the tree. Come and take Christ, then.
   You who never came before, come now. Come and welcome. You who have
   come often, and have entered into the palace, and are reclining at the
   banqueting table, you lords and peers of Christianity, come to the
   common wood and to the common apple tree where poor saints are shaded
   and fed. You had better come under the apple tree, like poor sinners
   such as I am, and be once more shaded with boughs and comforted with
   apples, for else you may faint beneath the palace glories. The best of
   saints are never better than when they eat their first fare, and are
   comforted with the apples which were their first gospel feast.

   The Lord Himself bring forth His own sweet fruit to you! Amen.

   OVER THE MOUNTAINS."My Beloved is mine, and I am His: He feedeth among the
lilies. Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my Beloved, and be
Thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether."-- Song of Solomon
                                  ii. 16, 17.

OVER THE MOUNTAINS.

   IT may be that there are saints who are always at their best, and are
   happy enough never to lose the light of their Father's countenance. I
   am not sure that there are such persons, for those believers with whom
   I have been most intimate have had a varied experience; and those whom
   I have known, who have boasted of their constant perfectness, have not
   been the most reliable of individuals. I hope there is a spiritual
   region attainable where there are no clouds to hide the Sun of our
   soul; but I cannot speak with positiveness, for I have not traversed
   that happy land. Every year of my life has had a winter as well as a
   summer, and every day its night. I have hitherto seen clear shinings
   and heavy rains, and felt warm breezes and fierce winds. Speaking for
   the many of my brethren, I confess that though the substance be in us,
   as in the teil-tree and the oak, yet we do lose our leaves, and the sap
   within us does not flow with equal vigour at all seasons. We have our
   downs as well as our ups, our valleys as well as our hills. We are not
   always rejoicing; we are sometimes in heaviness through manifold
   trials. Alas! we are grieved to confess that our fellowship with the
   Well-beloved is not always that of rapturous delight; but we have at
   times to seek Him, and cry, "Oh, that I knew where I might find Him!"
   This appears to me to have been in a measure the condition of the
   spouse when she cried, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,
   turn, my Beloved."

   I. These words teach us, first, that communion may be broken. The
   spouse had lost the company of her Bridegroom: conscious communion with
   Him was gone, though she loved her Lord, and sighed for Him. In her
   loneliness she was sorrowful; but she had by no means ceased to love
   Him, for she calls Him her Beloved, and speaks as one who felt no doubt
   upon that point. Love to the Lord Jesus may be quite as true, and
   perhaps quite as strong, when we sit in darkness as when we walk in the
   light. Nay, she had not last her assurance of His love to her, and of
   their mutual interest in one another; for she says, "My Beloved is
   mine, and I am His;" and yet she adds, "Turn, my Beloved." The
   condition of our graces does not always coincide with the state of our
   joys. We may be rich in faith and love, and yet have so low an esteem
   of ourselves as to be much depressed.

   It is plain, from this Sacred Canticle, that the spouse may love and be
   loved, may be confident in her Lord, and be fully assured of her
   possession of Him, and yet there may for the present be mountains
   between her and Him. Yes, we may even be far advanced in the divine
   life, and yet be exiled for a while from conscious fellowship. There
   are nights for men as well as babes, and the strong know that the sun
   is hidden quite as well as do the sick and the feeble. Do not,
   therefore, condemn yourself, my brother, because a cloud is over you;
   cast not away your confidence; but the rather let faith burn up in the
   gloom, and let your love resolve to come at your Lord again whatever be
   the barriers which divide you from Him.

   When Jesus is absent from a true heir of heaven, sorrow will ensue. The
   healthier our condition, the sooner will that absence be perceived, and
   the more deeply will it be lamented. This sorrow is described in the
   text as darkness; this is implied in the expression, "Until the day
   break." Till Christ appears, no day has dawned for us. We dwell in
   midnight darkness; the stars of the promises and the moon of experience
   yield no light of comfort till our Lord, like the sun, arises and ends
   the night. We must have Christ with us, or we are benighted: we grope
   like blind men for the wall, and wander in dismay.

   The spouse also speaks of shadows. "Until the day break, and the
   shadows flee away." Shadows are multiplied by the departure of the sun,
   and these are apt to distress the timid. We are not afraid of real
   enemies when Jesus is with us; but when we miss Him, we tremble at a
   shade. How sweet is that song, "Yea, though I walk through the valley
   of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy
   rod and Thy staff they comfort me!" But we change our note when
   midnight is now come, and Jesus is not with us: then we people the
   night with terrors: spectres, demons, hobgoblins, and things that never
   existed save in fancy, are apt to swarm about us; and we are in fear
   where no fear is.

   The spouse's worst trouble was that the back of her Beloved was turned
   to her, and so she cried, "Turn, my Beloved." When His face is towards
   her, she suns herself in His love; but if the light of His countenance
   is withdrawn, she is sorely troubled. Our Lord turns His face from His
   people though He never turns His heart from His people. He may even
   close His eyes in sleep when the vessel is tossed by the tempest, but
   His heart is awake all the while. Still, it is pain enough to have
   grieved Him in any degree: it cuts us to the quick to think that we
   have wounded His tender heart. He is jealous, but never without cause.
   If He turns His back upon us for a while, He has doubtless a more than
   sufficient reason. He would not walk contrary to us if we had not
   walked contrary to Him. Ah, it is sad work this! The presence of the
   Lord makes this life the preface to the life celestial; but His absence
   leaves us pining and fainting, neither doth any comfort remain in the
   land of our banishment. The Scriptures and the ordinances, private
   devotion and public worship, are all as sun-dials,--most excellent when
   the sun shines, but of small avail in the dark. O Lord Jesus, nothing
   can compensate us for Thy loss! Draw near to Thy beloved yet again, for
   without Thee our night will never end.

   "See! I repent, and vex my soul,

   That I should leave Thee so!

   Where will those vile affections roll

   That let my Saviour go?"

   When communion with Christ is broken, in all true hearts there is a
   strong desire to win it back again. The man who has known the joy of
   communion with Christ, if he loses it, will never be content until it
   is restored. Hast thou ever entertained the Prince Emmanuel? Is He gone
   elsewhere? Thy chamber will be dreary till He comes back again. "Give
   me Christ or else I die," is the cry of every spirit that has lost, the
   dear companionship of Jesus. We do not part with such heavenly delights
   without many a pang. It is not with us a matter of "maybe He will
   return, and we hope He will;" but it must be, or we faint and die. We
   cannot live without Him; and this is a cheering sign; for the soul that
   cannot live without Him shall not live without Him: He comes speedily
   where life and death hang on His coming. If you must have Christ you
   shall have Him. This is just how the matter stands: we must drink of
   this well or die of thirst; we must feed upon Jesus or our spirit will
   famish.

   II. We will now advance a step, and say that when communion with Christ
   is broken, there are great difficulties in the way of its renewal. It
   is much easier to go down hill than to climb to the same height again.
   It is far easier to lose joy in God than to find the lost jewel. The
   spouse speaks of "mountains" dividing her from her Beloved: she means
   that the difficulties were great. They were not little hills, but
   mountains, that closed up her way. Mountains of remembered sin, Alps of
   backsliding, dread ranges of forgetfulness, ingratitude, worldliness,
   coldness in prayer, frivolity, pride, unbelief. Ah me, I cannot teach
   you all the dark geography of this sad experience! Giant walls rose
   before her like the towering steeps of Lebanon. How could she come at
   her Beloved?

   The dividing difficulties were many as well as great. She does not
   speak of "a mountain", but of "mountains": Alps rose on Alps, wall
   after wall. She was distressed to think that in so short a time so much
   could come between her and Him of whom she sang just now, "His left
   hand is under my head, and His right hand doth embrace me." Alas, we
   multiply these mountains of Bether with a sad rapidity! Our Lord is
   jealous, and we give Him far too much reason, for hiding His face. A
   fault, which seemed so small at the time we committed it, is seen in
   the light of its own consequences, and then it grows and swells till it
   towers aloft, and hides the face of the Beloved. Then has our sun gone
   down, and fear whispers, "Will His light ever return? Will it ever be
   daybreak? Will the shadows ever flee away?" It is easy to grieve away
   the heavenly sunlight, but ah, how hard to clear the skies, and regain
   the unclouded brightness!

   Perhaps the worst thought of all to the spouse was the dread that the
   dividing barrier might be permanent. It was high, but it might
   dissolve; the walls were many, but they might fall; but, alas, they
   were mountains, and these stand fast for ages! She felt like the
   Psalmist, when he cried, "My sin is ever before me." The pain of our
   Lord's absence becomes: intolerable when we fear that we are hopelessly
   shut out from Him. A night one can bear, hoping for the morning; but
   what if the day should never break? And you and I, if we have wandered
   away from Christ, and feel that there are ranges of immovable mountains
   between Him and us, will feel sick at heart. We try to pray, but
   devotion dies on our lips. We attempt to approach the Lord at the
   communion table, but we feel more like Judas than John. At such times
   we have felt that we would give our eyes once more to behold the
   Bridegroom's face, and to know that He delights in us as in happier
   days. Still there stand the awful mountains, black, threatening,
   impassable; and in the far-off land the Life of our life is away, and
   grieved.

   So the spouse seems to have come to the conclusion that the
   difficulties in her way were insurmountable by her own power. She does
   not even think of herself going over the mountains to her Beloved, but
   she cries, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my
   Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of
   Bether." She will not try to climb the mountains, she knows she cannot:
   if they had been less high, she might have attempted it; but their
   summits reach to heaven. If they had been less craggy or difficult, she
   might have tried to scale them; but these mountains are terrible, and
   no foot may stand upon their lone crags. Oh, the mercy of utter
   self-despair! I love to see a soul driven into that close corner, and
   forced therefore to look to God alone. The end of the creature is the
   beginning of the Creator. Where the sinner ends the Saviour begins. If
   the mountains can be climbed, we shall have to climb them; but if they
   are quite impassable, then the soul cries out with the prophet, "Oh,
   that Thou wouldest rend the heavens, that Thou wouldest come down, that
   the mountains might flow down at Thy presence. As when the melting fire
   burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make Thy name known to
   Thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Thy presence. When
   Thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, Thou camest down,
   the mountains flowed down at Thy presence." Our souls are lame, they
   cannot move to Christ, and we turn our strong desires to Him, and fix
   our hopes alone upon Him; will He not remember us in love, and fly to
   us as He did to His servant of old when He rode upon a cherub, and did
   fly, yea, He did fly upon the wings of the wind?

   III. Here arises that prayer of the text which fully meets the case.
   "Turn, my Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a young hart upon the
   mountains of division." Jesus can come to us when we cannot go to Him.
   The roe and the young hart, or, as you may read it, the gazelle and the
   ibex, live among the crags of the mountains, and leap across the abyss
   with amazing agility. For swiftness and sure-footedness they are
   unrivalled. The sacred poet said, "He maketh my feet like hinds' feet,
   and setteth me upon my high places," alluding to the feet of those
   creatures which are so fitted to stand securely on the mountain's side.
   Our blessed Lord is called, in the title of the twenty-second Psalm,
   "the Hind of the morning "; and the spouse in this golden Canticle
   sings, "My Beloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold He cometh,
   leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills."

   Here I would remind you that this prayer is one that we may fairly
   offer, because it is the way of Christ to come to us when our coming to
   Him is out of the question. "How?" say you. I answer that of old He did
   this; for we remember "His great love wherewith He loved us even when
   we were dead in trespasses and in sins." His first coming into the
   world in human form, was it not because man could never come to God
   until God had come to him? I hear of no tears, or prayers, or
   entreaties after God on the part of our first parents; but the offended
   Lord spontaneously gave the promise that the Seed of the woman should
   bruise the serpent's head. Our Lord's coming into the world was
   unbought, unsought, unthought of; he came altogether of His own free
   will, delighting to redeem.

   "With pitying eyes, the Prince of grace

   Beheld our helpless grief;

   He saw, and (oh, amazing love!)

   He ran to our relief."

   His incarnation was a type of the way in which He comes to us by His
   Spirit. He saw us cast out, polluted, shameful, perishing; and as He
   passed by, His tender lips said, "Live!" In us is fulfilled that word,
   "I am found of them that sought Me not." We were too averse to
   holiness, too much in bondage to sin, ever to have returned to Him if
   He had not turned to us. What think you? Did He come to us when we were
   enemies, and will He not visit us now that we are friends? Did He come
   to us when we were dead sinners, and will He not hear us now that we
   are weeping saints? If Christ's coming to the earth was after this
   manner, and if His coming to each one of us was after this style, we
   may well hope that now He will come to us in like fashion, like the dew
   which refreshes the grass, and waiteth not for man, neither tarrieth
   for the sons of men. Besides, He is coming again in person, in the
   latter-day, and mountains of sin, and error, and idolatry, and
   superstition, and oppression stand in the way of His kingdom; but He
   will surely come and overturn, and overturn, till He shall reign over
   all. He will come in the latter-days, I say, though He shall leap the
   hills to do it, and because of that I am sure we may comfortably
   conclude that He will draw near to us who mourn His absence so
   bitterly. Then let us bow our heads a moment, and silently present to
   His most excellent Majesty the petition of our text: "Turn, my Beloved,
   and be Thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of division."

   Our text gives us sweet assurance that our Lord is at home with those
   difficulties which are quite insurmountable by us. Just as the roe or
   the young hart knows the passes of the mountains, and the
   stepping-places among the rugged rocks, and is void of all fear among
   the ravines and the precipices, so does our Lord know the heights and
   depths, the torrents and the caverns of our sin and sorrow. He carried
   the whole of our transgression, and so became aware of the tremendous
   load of our guilt. He is quite at home with the infirmities of our
   nature; He knew temptation in the wilderness, heart-break in the
   garden, desertion on the cross. He is quite at home with pain and
   weakness, for "Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses."
   He is at home with despondency, for He was "a Man of sorrows, and
   acquainted with grief." He is at home even with death, for He gave up
   the ghost, and passed through the sepulchre to resurrection. O yawning
   gulfs and frowning steeps of woe, our Beloved, like hind or hart, has
   traversed your glooms! O my Lord, Thou knowest all that divides me from
   Thee; and Thou knowest also that I am far too feeble to climb these
   dividing mountains, so that I may come at Thee; therefore, I pray Thee,
   come Thou over the mountains to meet my longing spirit! Thou knowest
   each yawning gulf and slippery steep, but none of these can stay Thee;
   haste Thou to me, Thy servant, Thy beloved, and let me again live by
   Thy presence.

   It is easy, too, for Christ to come over the mountains for our relief.
   It is easy for the gazelle to cross the mountains, it is made for that
   end; so is it easy for Jesus, for to this purpose was He ordained from
   of old that He might come to man in his worst estate, and bring with
   Him the Father's love. What is it that separates us from Christ? Is it
   a sense of sin? You have been pardoned once, and Jesus can renew most
   vividly a sense of full forgiveness. But you say, "Alas! I have sinned
   again: fresh guilt alarms me." He can remove it in an instant, for the
   fountain appointed for that purpose is opened, and is still full. It is
   easy for the dear lips of redeeming love to put away the child's
   offences, since He has already obtained pardon for the criminal's
   iniquities. If with His heart's blood He won our pardon from our Judge,
   he can easily enough bring us the forgiveness of our Father. Oh, yes,
   it is easy enough for Christ to say again, "Thy sins be forgiven"! "But
   I feel so unfit, so unable to enjoy communion." He that healed all
   manner of bodily diseases can heal with a word your spiritual
   infirmities. Remember the man whose ankle-bones received strength, so
   that he ran and leaped; and her who was sick of a fever, and was healed
   at once, and arose, and ministered unto her Lord. "My grace is
   sufficient for thee; for My strength is made perfect in weakness." "But
   I have such afflictions, such troubles, such sorrows, that I am
   weighted down, and cannot rise into joyful fellowship." Yes, but Jesus
   can make every burden light, and cause each yoke to be easy. Your
   trials can be made to aid your heavenward course instead of hindering
   it. I know all about those heavy weights, and I perceive that you
   cannot lift them; but skilful engineers can adapt ropes and pulleys in
   such a way that heavy weights lift other weights. The Lord Jesus is
   great at gracious machinery, and He has the art of causing a weight of
   tribulation to lift from us a load of spiritual deadness, so that we
   ascend by that which, like a millstone, threatened to sink us down.

   What else doth hinder? I am sure that, if it were a sheer
   impossibility, the Lord Jesus could remove it, for things impossible
   with men are possible with God. But someone objects, "I am so unworthy
   of Christ. I can understand eminent saints and beloved disciples being
   greatly indulged, but I am a worm, and no man; utterly below such
   condescension." Say you so? Know you not that the worthiness of Christ
   covers your unworthiness, and He is made of God unto you wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption? In Christ, the Father
   thinks not so meanly of you as you think of yourself; you are not
   worthy to be called His child, but He does call you so, and reckons you
   to be among His jewels. Listen, and you shall hear Him say," Since thou
   wast precious in My sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved
   thee. I gave Egypt for thy ransom; Ethiopia and Seba for thee." Thus,
   then, there remains nothing which Jesus cannot overleap if He resolves
   to come to you, and re-establish your broken fellowship.

   To conclude, our Lord can do all this directly. As in the twinkling of
   an eye the dead shall be raised incorruptible, so in a moment can our
   dead affections rise to fulness of delight. He can say to this
   mountain, "Be thou removed hence, and be thou cast into the midst of
   the sea," and it shall be done. In the sacred emblems now upon this
   supper table, Jesus is already among us. Faith cries, "He has come!"
   Like John the Baptist, she gazes intently on Him, and cries, "Behold
   the Lamb of God!" At this table Jesus feeds us with His body and His
   blood. His corporeal presence we have not, but His real spiritual
   presence we perceive. We are like the disciples when none of them durst
   ask Him, "Who art Thou?" knowing that it was the Lord. He is come. He
   looketh forth at these windows,--I mean this bread and wine; showing
   Himself through the lattices of this instructive and endearing
   ordinance. He speaks. He saith, "The winter is past, the rain is over
   and gone." And so it is; we feel it to be so: a heavenly springtide
   warms our frozen hearts. Like the spouse, we wonderingly cry, "Or ever
   I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib." Now in
   happy fellowship we see the Beloved, and hear His voice; our heart
   burns; our affections glow; we are happy, restful, brimming over with
   delight. The King has brought us into his banqueting-house, and His
   banner over us is love. It is good to be here!

   Friends, we must now go our ways. A voice saith, "Arise, let us go
   hence." O Thou Lord of our hearts, go with us! Home will not be home
   without Thee. Life will not be life without Thee. Heaven itself would
   not be heaven if Thou wert absent. Abide with us. The world grows dark,
   the gloaming of time draws on. Abide with us, for it is toward evening.
   Our years increase, and we near the night when dews fall cold and
   chill. A great future is all about us, the splendours of the last age
   are coming down; and while we wait in solemn, awe-struck expectation,
   our heart continually cries within herself, "Until the day break, and
   the shadows flee away, turn, my Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a
   young hart upon the mountains of division."

   "Hasten, Lord! the promised hour;

   Come in glory and in power;

   Still Thy foes are unsubdued;

   Nature sighs to be renew'd.

   Time has nearly reach'd its sum,

   All things with Thy bride say Come;'

   Jesus, whom all worlds adore,

   Come and reign for evermore!"

 FRAGRANT SPICES FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF MYRRH."Thou art all fair, My love; there
                  is no spot in thee."--Song of Solomon iv. 7.

FRAGRANT SPICES FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF MYRRH.

   HOW marvellous are these words! "Thou art all fair, My love; there is
   no spot in thee." The glorious Bridegroom is charmed with His spouse,
   and sings soft canticles of admiration. When the bride extols her Lord
   there is no wonder, for He deserves it well, and in Him there is room
   for praise without possibility of flattery. But does He who is wiser
   than Solomon condescend to praise this sunburnt Shulamite? Tis even so,
   for these are His own words, and were uttered by His own sweet lips.
   Nay, doubt not, O young believer, for we have more wonders to reveal!
   There are greater depths in heavenly things than thou hast at present
   dared to hope. The Church not only is all fair in the eyes of her
   Beloved, but in one sense she always was so.

   "In God's decree, her form He view'd;

   All beauteous in His eyes she stood,

   Presented by Th' eternal name,

   Betroth'd in love, and free from blame.

   "Not as she stood in Adam's fall,

   When guilt and ruin cover'd all;

   But as she'll stand another day,

   Fairer than sun's meridian ray."

   He delighted in her before she had either a natural or a spiritual
   being, and from the beginning could He say, "My delights were with the
   sons of men." (Prov. viii. 31.) Having covenanted to be the Surety of
   the elect, and having determined to fulfil every stipulation of that
   covenant, He from all eternity delighted to survey the purchase of His
   blood, and rejoiced to view His Church, in the purpose and decree, as
   already by Him delivered from sin, and exalted to glory and happiness.

   "Oh, glorious grace, mysterious plan

   Too great for angel-mind to scan,

   Our thoughts are lost, our numbers fail;

   All hail, redeeming love, all hail!"

   Now with joy and gladness let us approach the subject of Christ's
   delight in His Church, as declared by Him whom the Spirit has sealed in
   our hearts as the faithful and true Witness.

   Our first bundle of myrrh lies in the open hand of the text.

   I. Christ has a high esteem for his church. He does not blindly admire
   her faults, or even conceal them from Himself. He is acquainted with
   her sin, in all its heinousness of guilt, and desert of punishment.
   That sin He does not shun to reprove. His own words are, "As many as I
   love, I rebuke and chasten." (Rev iii. 19.) He abhors sin in her as
   much as in the ungodly world, nay even more, for He sees in her an evil
   which is not to be found in the transgressions of others,--sin against
   love and grace. She is black in her own sight, how much more so in the
   eyes of her Omniscient Lord! Yet there it stands, written by the
   inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and flowing from the lips of the
   Bridegroom, "Thou art all fair, My love; there is no spot in thee." How
   then is this? Is it a mere exaggeration of love, an enthusiastic
   canticle, which the sober hand of truth must strip of its glowing
   fables? Oh, no! The King is full of love, but He is not so overcome
   with it as to forget His reason. The words are true, and He means us to
   understand them as the honest expression of His unbiassed judgment,
   after having patiently examined her in every part. He would not have us
   diminish aught, but estimate the gold of His opinions by the bright
   glittering of His expressions; and, therefore, in order that there may
   be no mistake, He states it positively: "Thou art all fair, My love,"
   and confirms it by a negative: "there is no spot in thee."

   When He speaks positively, how complete is His admiration! She is
   "fair", but that is not a full description; He styles her "all fair."
   He views her in Himself, washed in His sin-atoning blood, and clothed
   in His meritorious righteousness, and He considers her to be full of
   comeliness and beauty. No wonder that such is the case, since it is but
   His own perfect excellences that He admires, seeing that the holiness,
   glory, and perfection of His Church are His own garments on the back of
   His own well-beloved spouse, and she is "bone of His bone, and flesh of
   His flesh." She is not simply pure, or well-proportioned; she is
   positively lovely and fair! She has actual merit! Her deformities of
   sin are removed; but more, she has through her Lord obtained a
   meritorious righteousness by which an actual beauty is conferred upon
   her. Believers have a positive righteousness given to them when they
   become "accepted in the Beloved." (Eph. i. 6.)

   Nor is the Church barely lovely, she is superlatively so. Her Lord
   styles her, "Thou fairest among women." (Sol. Song i. 8.) She has a
   real worth and excellence which cannot be rivalled by all the nobility
   and royalty of the world. If Jesus could exchange His elect bride for
   all the queens and empresses of earth, or even for the angels in
   heaven, He would not, for He puts her first and foremost,--"fairest
   among women." Nor is this an opinion which He is ashamed of, for He
   invites all men to hear it. He puts a "behold" before it, a special
   note of exclamation, inviting and arresting attention. "Behold, thou
   art fair, My love; behold, thou art fair." (Sol. Song iv. 1.) His
   opinion He publishes abroad even now, and one day from the throne of
   His glory He will avow the truth of it before the assembled universe.
   "Come, ye blessed of My Father" (Matt. xxv. 34), will be His solemn
   affirmation of the loveliness of His elect.

   Let us mark well the repeated sentences of His approbation.

   "Lo, thou art fair! lo, thou art fair!

   Twice fair thou art, I say;

   My righteousness and graces are

   Thy double bright array.

   "But since thy faith can hardly own

   My beauty put on thee;

   Behold! behold! twice be it known

   Thou art all fair to Me!"

   He turns again to the subject, a second time looks into those doves'
   eyes of hers, and listens to her honey-dropping lips. It is not enough
   to say, "Behold, thou art fair, My love;" He rings that golden bell
   again, and sings again, and again, "Behold, thou art fair."

   After having surveyed her whole person with rapturous delight, He
   cannot be satisfied until He takes a second gaze, and afresh recounts
   her beauties. Making but little difference between His first
   description and the last, he adds extraordinary expressions of love to
   manifest His increased delight. "Thou art beautiful, O My love, as
   Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. Turn
   away thine eyes from Me, for they have overcome Me: thy hair is as a
   flock of goats that appear from Gilead. Thy teeth are as a flock of
   sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins,
   and there is not one barren among them. As a piece of a pomegranate are
   thy temples within thy locks. . . . My dove, My undefiled is but one;
   she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that
   bare her." (Sol. Song vi. 4-7, 9.)

   The beauty which He admires is universal, He is as much enchanted with
   her temples as with her breasts. All her offices, all her pure
   devotions, all her earnest labours, all her constant sufferings, are
   precious to His heart. She is "all fair." Her ministry, her psalmody,
   her intercessions, her alms, her watching, all are admirable to Him,
   when performed in the Spirit. Her faith, her love, her patience, her
   zeal, are alike in His esteem as "rows of jewels" and "chains of gold."
   (Sol. Song i. 10.) He loves and admires her everywhere. In the house of
   bondage, or in the land of Canaan, she is ever fair. On the top of
   Lebanon His heart is ravished with one of her eyes, and in the fields
   and villages He joyfully receives her loves. He values her above gold
   and silver in the days of His gracious manifestations, but He has an
   equal appreciation of her when He withdraws Himself, for it is
   immediately after He had said, "Until the day break, and the shadows
   flee away, I will get Me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of
   frankincense," (Sol. Song iv. 6,) that He exclaims, in the words of our
   text, "Thou art all fair, My love." At all seasons believers are very
   near the heart of the Lord Jesus, they are always as the apple of His
   eye, and the jewel of His crown. Our name is still on His breastplate,
   and our persons are still in His gracious remembrance. He never thinks
   lightly of His people; and certainly in all the compass of His Word
   there is not one syllable which looks like contempt of them. They are
   the choice treasure and peculiar portion of the Lord of hosts; and what
   king will undervalue his own inheritance? What loving husband will
   despise his own wife? Let others call the Church what they may, Jesus
   does not waver in His love to her, and does not differ in His judgment
   of her, for He still exclaims, "How fair and how pleasant art thou, O
   love, for delights!" (Sol. Song vii. 6.)

   Let us remember that He who pronounces the Church and each individual
   believer to be "all fair" is none other than the glorious Son of God,
   who is "very God of very God." Hence His declaration is decisive, since
   infallibility has uttered it. There can be no mistake where the
   all-seeing Jehovah is the Judge. If He has pronounced her to be
   incomparably fair, she is so, beyond a doubt; and though hard for our
   poor puny faith to receive, it is nevertheless as divine a verity as
   any of the undoubted doctrines of revelation.

   Having thus pronounced her positively full of beauty, He now confirms
   His praise by a precious negative: "There is no spot in thee." As if
   the thought occurred to the Bridegroom that the carping world would
   insinuate that He had only mentioned her comely parts, and had
   purposely omitted those features which were deformed or defiled, He
   sums all up by declaring her universally and entirely fair, and utterly
   devoid of stain. A spot may soon be removed, and is the very least
   thing that can disfigure beauty, but even from this little blemish the
   Church is delivered in her Lord's sight. If He had said there is no
   hideous scar, no horrible deformity, no filthy ulcer, we might even
   then have marvelled; but when He testifies that she is free from the
   slightest spot, all these things are included, and the depth of wonder
   is increased. If He had but promised to remove all spots, we should
   have had eternal reason for joy; but when He Speaks of it as already
   done, who can restrain the most intense emotions of satisfaction and
   delight? O my soul, here is marrow and fatness for thee; eat thy full,
   and be abundantly glad therein!

   Christ Jesus has no quarrel with His spouse. She often wanders from
   Him, and grieves His Holy Spirit, but He does not allow her faults to
   affect His love. He sometimes chides, but it is always in the tenderest
   manner, with the kindest intentions;--it is "My love" even then. There
   is no remembrance of our follies, He does not cherish ill thoughts of
   us, but He pardons, and loves as well after the offence as before it.
   It is well for us it is so, for if Jesus were as mindful of injuries as
   we are, how could He commune with us? Many a time a believer will put
   himself out of humour with the Lord for some slight turn in providence,
   but our precious Husband knows our silly hearts too well to take any
   offence at our ill manners.

   If He were as easily provoked as we are, who among us could hope for a
   comfortable look or a kind salutation? but He is "ready to pardon, slow
   to anger." (Neh. ix. 17.) He is like Noah's sons, He goes backward, and
   throws a cloak over our nakedness; or we may compare Him to Apelles,
   who, when he painted Alexander, put his finger over the scar on the
   cheek, that it might not be seen in the picture. "He hath not beheld
   iniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel" (Num.
   xxiii. 21); and hence He is able to commune with the erring sons of
   men.

   But the question returns,--How is this? Can it be explained, so as not
   to clash with the most evident fact that sin remaineth even in the
   hearts of the regenerate? Can our own daily bewailings of sin allow of
   anything like perfection as a present attainment? The Lord Jesus saith
   it, and therefore it must be true; but in what sense is it to be
   understood? How are we "all fair" though we ourselves feel that we are
   black, because the sun hath looked upon us? (Sol. Song i. 6.) The
   answer is ready, if we consider the analogy of faith.

   1. In the matter of justification, the saints are complete and without
   sin. As Durham says, these words are spoken "in respect of the
   imputation of Christ's righteousness wherewith they are adorned, and
   which they have put on, which makes them very glorious and lovely, so
   that they are beautiful beyond all others, through His comeliness put
   upon them."

   And Dr. Gill excellently expresses the same idea, when he writes,
   "though all sin is seen by God, in articulo providentiae, in the matter
   of providence, wherein nothing escapes His all-seeing eye; yet in
   articula iustificationis, in the matter of justification, He sees no
   sin in His people, so as to reckon it to them, or condemn them for it;
   for they all stand holy and unblameable and unreproveable in His
   sight.'" (Col. i. 22.) The blood of Jesus removes all stain, and His
   righteousness confers perfect beauty; and, therefore, in the Beloved,
   the true believer is at this hour as much accepted and approved, in the
   sight of God, as He will be when He stands before the throne in heaven.
   The beauty of justification is at its fulness the moment a soul is by
   faith received into the Lord Jesus. This is righteousness so
   transcendent that no one can exaggerate its glorious merit. Since this
   righteousness is that of Jesus, the Son of God, it is therefore divine,
   and is, indeed, the holiness of God; and, hence, Kent was not too
   daring when, in a bold flight of rapture, he sang,--

   "In thy Surety thou art free,

   His dear hands were pierced for thee;

   With His spotless vesture on,

   Holy as the Holy One.

   "Oh, the heights and depths of grace,

   Shining with meridian blaze;

   Here the sacred records show

   Sinners black, but comely too!"

   2. But perhaps it is best to understand this as relating to the design
   of Christ concerning them. It is His purpose to present them without
   "spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." (Eph. v. 27.) They shall be holy
   and unblameable and unreproveable in the sight of the Omniscient God.
   In prospect of this, the Church is viewed as being virtually what she
   is soon to be actually. Nor is this a frivolous antedating of her
   excellence; for be it ever remembered that the Representative, in whom
   she is accepted, is actually complete in all perfections and glories at
   this very moment. As the Head of the body is already without sin, being
   none other than the Lord from heaven, it is but in keeping that the
   whole body should be pronounced comely and fair through the glory of
   the Head. The fact of her future perfection is so certain that it is
   spoken of as if it were already accomplished, and indeed it is so in
   the mind of Him to whom a thousand years are but as one day. "Christ
   often expounds an honest believer, from His own heart, purpose and
   design; in which respect they get many titles, otherwise unsuitable to
   their present condition. (Durham.) Let us magnify the name of our
   Jesus, who loves us so well that He will overleap the dividing years of
   our pilgrimage, that He may give us even now the praise which seems to
   be only fitted for the perfection of Paradise. As Erskine sings,--

   "My love, thou seem'st a loathsome worm:

   Yet such thy beauties be,

   I spoke but half thy comely form;

   Thou'rt wholly fair to Me.

   "Whole justified, in perfect dress;

   Nor justice, nor the law

   Can in thy robe of righteousness

   Discern the smallest flaw.

   "Yea, sanctified in ev'ry part,

   Thou art perfect in design:

   And I judge thee by what thou art

   In thy intent and Mine.

   "Fair love, by grace complete in Me,

   Beyond all beauteous brides;

   Each spot that ever sullied thee

   My purple vesture hides."

   II. Our Lord's admiration is sweetened by love. He addresses the spouse
   as "My love." The virgins called her "the fairest among women"; they
   saw and admired, but it was reserved for her Lord to love her. Who can
   fully tell the excellence of His love? Oh, how His heart goeth forth
   after His redeemed! As for the love of David and Jonathan, it is far
   exceeded in Christ. No tender husband was ever so fond as He. No
   figures can completely set forth His heart's affection, for it
   surpasses all the love that man or woman hath heard or thought of. Our
   blessed Lord, Himself, when He would declare the greatness of it, was
   compelled to compare one inconceivable thing with another, in order to
   express His own thoughts. "As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved
   you." (John xv. 9.) All the eternity, fervency, immutability, and
   infinity which are to be found in the love of Jehovah the Father,
   towards Jehovah-Jesus the Son, are copied to the letter in the love of
   the Lord Jesus towards His chosen ones. Before the foundation of the
   world He loved His people, in all their wanderings He loved them, and
   unto the end He will abide in His love. (John xiii. 1.) He has given
   them the best proof of His affection, in that He gave Himself to die
   for their sins, and hath revealed to them complete pardon as the result
   of His death. The willing manner of His death is further confirmation
   of His boundless love. How Christ did delight in the work of our
   redemption! "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of Me,
   I delight to do Thy will, O my God." (Psalm xl. 7, 8.) When He came
   into the world to sacrifice His life for us, it was a freewill
   offering. "I have a baptism to be baptized with." (Luke xii. 50.)
   Christ was to be, as it were, baptized in His own blood, and how did He
   thirst for that time! "How am I straitened till it be accomplished."
   There was no hesitation, no desire to be quit of His engagement. He
   went to His crucifixion without once halting by the way to deliberate
   whether He should complete His sacrifice. The stupendous mass of our
   fearful debt He paid at once, asking neither delay nor diminution. From
   the moment when He said, "Not My will, but Thine, be done" (Luke xxii.
   42), His course was swift and unswerving; as if He had been hastening
   to a crown rather than to a cross. The fulness of time was His only
   remembrancer; He was not driven by bailiffs to discharge the
   obligations of His Church, but joyously, even when full of sorrow, He
   met the law, answered its demands, and cried, "It is finished."

   How hard it is to talk of love so as to convey out meaning with it! How
   often have our eyes been full of tears when we have realized the
   thought that Jesus loves us! How has our spirit been melted within us
   at the assurance that He thinks of us and bears us on His heart! But we
   cannot kindle the like emotion in others, nor can we give, by word of
   mouth, so much as a faint idea of the bliss which coucheth in that
   exclamation, "Oh, how He loves!" Come, reader, canst thou say of
   thyself, "He loved me"? (Gal. ii. 20.) Then look down into this sea of
   love, and endeavour to guess its depth. Doth it not stagger thy faith,
   that He should love thee? Or, if thou hast strong confidence, say, does
   it not enfold thy spirit in a flame of admiring and adoring gratitude?
   O ye angels, such love as this ye never knew! Jesus doth not bear your
   names upon His hands, or call you His bride. No! this highest
   fellowship he reserves for worms whose only return is tearful, hearty
   thanksgiving and love.

   III. Let us note that Christ delights to think upon his Church, and to
   look upon her beauty. As the bird returneth often to its nest, and as
   the wayfarer hastens to his home, so doth the mind continually pursue
   the object of its choice. We cannot look too often upon that face which
   we love; we desire always to have our precious things in our sight. It
   is even so with our Lord Jesus. From all eternity, "His delights were
   with the sons of men;" His thoughts rolled onward to the time when His
   elect should be born into the world; He viewed them in the mirror of
   His fore-knowledge. "In thy book," He says, "all my members were
   written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was
   none of them." (Ps. cxxxix. 16.) When the world was set upon its
   pillars, He was there, and He set the bounds of the people according to
   the number of the children of Israel. Many a time, before His
   incarnation, He descended to this earth in the similitude of a man; on
   the plains of Mamre (Gen. xviii.), by the brook of Jabbok (Gen. xxxii.
   24-30), beneath the walls of Jericho (Josh. v. 13), and in the fiery
   furnace of Babylon (Dan. iii. 19-25), the Son of man did visit His
   people. Because His soul delighted in them, He could not rest away from
   them, for His heart longed after them. Never were they absent from His
   heart, for He had written their names upon His hands, and graven them
   upon His heart. As the breast-plate containing the names of the tribes
   of Israel was the most brilliant ornament worn by the high priest, so
   the names of Christ's elect were His most precious Jewels, which He
   ever hung nearest His heart. We may often forget to meditate upon the
   perfections of our Lord, but He never ceases to remember us. He cares
   not one half so much for any of His most glorious works as He does for
   His children. Although His eye seeth everything that hath beauty and
   excellence in it, He never fixes His gaze anywhere with that admiration
   and delight which He spends upon His purchased ones. He charges His
   angels concerning them, and calls upon those holy beings to rejoice
   with Him over His lost sheep. (Luke xv. 4-7.) He talked of them to
   Himself, and even on the tree of doom He did not cease to soliloquize
   concerning them. He saw of the travail of His soul, and He was
   abundantly satisfied.

   "That day acute of ignominious woe,

   Was, notwithstanding, in a perfect sense,

   'The day of His heart's gladness,' for the joy

   That His redeem'd should be brought home at last

   (Made ready as in robes of bridal white),

   Was set before Him vividly,--He look'd;--

   And for that happiness anticipate,

   Endurance of all torture, all disgrace,

   Seem'd light infliction to His heart of love."

   Like a fond mother, Christ Jesus, our thrice-blessed Lord, sees every
   dawning of excellence, and every bud of goodness in us, making much of
   our litties, and rejoicing over the beginnings of our graces. As He is
   to be our endless song, so we are His perpetual prayer. When He is
   absent He thinks of us, and in the black darkness He has a window
   through which He looks upon us. When the sun sets in one part of the
   earth, he rises in another place beyond our visible horizon; and even
   so Jesus, our Sun of Righteousness, is only pouring light upon His
   people in a different way, when to our apprehension He seems to have
   set in darkness. His eye is ever upon the vineyard, which is His
   Church: "I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
   hurt it, I will keep it night and day." (Isa. xxvii. 3.) He will not
   trust to His angels to do it, for it is His delight to do all with His
   own hands. Zion is in the centre of His heart, and He cannot forget
   her, for every day His thoughts are set upon her. When the bride by her
   neglect of Him hath hidden herself from His sight, He cannot be quiet
   until again He looks upon her. He calls her forth with the most wooing
   words, "O My dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
   places of the stairs, let Me see thy countenance; let Me hear thy
   voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely." (Sol.
   Song ii. 14.) She thinks herself unmeet to keep company with such a
   Prince, but He entices her from her lurking-place, and inasmuch as she
   comes forth trembling, and bashfully hides her face with her veil, He
   bids her uncover her face, and let her Husband gaze upon her. She is
   ashamed to do so, for she is black in her own esteem, and therefore He
   urges that she is comely to Him.

   Nor is He content with looking, He must feed His ears as well as His
   eyes, and therefore He commends her speech, and intreats her to let Him
   hear her voice. See how truly our Lord rejoiceth in us. Is not this
   unparalleled love! We have heard of princes who have been smitten by
   the beauty of a peasant's daughter, but what of that? Here is the Son
   of God doting upon a worm, looking with eyes of admiration upon a poor
   child of Adam, and listening with joy to the lispings of poor flesh and
   blood. Ought we not to be exceedingly charmed by such matchless
   condescension? And should not our hearts as much delight in Him as He
   doth in us? O surprising truth! Christ Jesus rejoices over His poor,
   tempted, tried, and erring people.

   IV. It is not to be forgotten that sometimes the Lord Jesus tells His
   people His love thoughts. "He does not think it enough behind her back
   to tell it, but in her very presence, He says, Thou art all fair, My
   love.' It is true, this is not His ordinary method; He is a wise lover,
   that knows when to keep back the intimation of love, and when to let it
   out; but there are times when He will make no secret of it; times when
   He will put it beyond all dispute in the souls of His people." [1]

   The Holy Spirit is often pleased in a most gracious manner to witness
   with our spirits of the love of Jesus. He takes of the things of
   Christ, and reveals them unto us. No voice is heard from the clouds,
   and no vision is seen in the night, but we have a testimony more sure
   than either of these. If an angel should fly from heaven, and inform
   the saint personally of the Saviour's love to him, the evidence would
   not be one whir more satisfactory than that which is borne in the heart
   by the Holy Ghost. Ask those of the Lord's people who have lived the
   nearest to the gates of heaven, and they will tell you that they have
   had seasons when the love of Christ towards them has been a fact so
   clear and sure, that they could no more doubt it than they could
   question their own existence.

   Yes, beloved believer, you and I have had times of refreshing from the
   presence of the Lord, and then our faith has mounted to the topmost
   heights of assurance. We have had confidence to lean our heads upon the
   bosom of our Lord, and we have had no more question about our Master's
   affection than John had when in that blessed posture, nay, nor so much;
   for the dark question, "Lord, is it I that shall betray Thee?" has been
   put far from us. He has kissed us with the kisses of His love, and
   killed our doubts by the closeness of His embrace. His love has been
   sweeter than wine to our souls. We felt that we could sing, "His left
   hand is under my head, and His right hand doth embrace me." (Sol. Song
   viii. 3.) Then all earthly troubles were light as the chaff of the
   threshing-floor, and the pleasures of the world as tasteless as the
   white of an egg. We would have welcomed death as the messenger who
   would introduce us to our Lord to whom we were in haste to be gone; for
   His love had stirred us to desire more of Him, even His immediate and
   glorious presence. I have, sometimes, when the Lord has assured me of
   His love, felt as if I could not contain more joy and delight. My eyes
   ran down with tears of gratitude. I fell upon my knees to bless Him,
   but rose again in haste, feeling as if I had nothing more to ask for,
   but must stand up and praise Him; then have I lifted my hands to
   heaven, longing to fill my arms with Him; panting to talk with Him, as
   a man talketh with his friend, and to see Him in His own person, that I
   might tell Him how happy He had made His unworthy servant, and might
   fall on my face, and kiss His feet in unutterable thankfulness and
   love. Such a banquet have I had upon one word of my Beloved,--"thou art
   Mine,"--that I wished, like Peter, to build tabernacles in that mount,
   and dwell for ever. But, alas, we have not, all of us, yet learned how
   to preserve that blessed assurance. We stir up our Beloved and awake
   Him, then He leaves our unquiet chamber, and we grope after Him, and
   make many a weary journey trying to find Him.

   If we were wiser and more careful, we might preserve the fragrance of
   Christ's words far longer; for they are not like the ordinary manna
   which soon rotted, but are comparable to that omer of it which was put
   in the golden pot, and preserved for many generations. The sweet Lord
   Jesus has been known to write his love-thoughts on the heart of His
   people in so clear and deep a manner, that they have for months, and
   even for years, enjoyed an abiding sense of His affection. A few doubts
   have flitted across their minds like thin clouds before a summer's sun,
   but the warmth of their assurance has remained the same for many a
   gladsome day. Their path has been a smooth one, they have fed in the
   green pastures beside the still waters, for His rod and staff have
   comforted them, and His right hand hath led them. I am inclined to
   think that there is more of this in the Church than some men would
   allow. We have a goodly number who dwell upon the hills, and behold the
   light of the sun. There are giants in these days, though the times are
   not such as to allow them room to display their gigantic strength; in
   many a humble cot, in many a crowded workshop, in many a village manse
   there are to be found men of the house of David, men after God's own
   heart, anointed with the holy oil. It is, however, a mournful truth,
   that whole ranks in the army of our Lord are composed of dwarfish
   Littlefaiths. The men of fearful mind and desponding heart are
   everywhere to be seen. Why is this? Is it the Master's fault, or ours?
   Surely He cannot be blamed. Is it not then a matter of enquiry in our
   own souls, Can I not grow stronger? Must I be a mourner all my days?
   How can I get rid of my doubts? The answer must be: yes, you can be
   comforted, but only the mouth of the Lord can do it, for anything less
   than this will be unsatisfactory.

   I doubt not that there are means, by the use of which those who are now
   weak and trembling may attain unto boldness in faith and confidence in
   hope; but I see not how this can be done unless the Lord Jesus Christ
   manifest His love to them, and tell them of their union to Him. This He
   will do, if we seek it of Him. The importunate pleader shall not lack
   his reward. Haste thee to Him, O timid one, and tell Him that nothing
   will content thee but a smile from His own face, and a word from His
   own lips! Speak to Him, and say, "O my Lord Jesus, I cannot rest unless
   I know that Thou lovest me! I desire to have proof of Thy love under
   Thine own hand and seal.

   I cannot live upon guesses and surmises; nothing but certainty will
   satisfy my trembling heart. Lord, look upon me, if, indeed, Thou lovest
   me, and though I be less than the least of all saints, say unto my
   soul, I am thy salvation.'" When this prayer is heard, the castle of
   despair must totter; there is not one stone of it which can remain upon
   another, if Christ whispers forth His love. Even Despondency and
   Much-afraid will dance, and Ready-to-Halt leap upon his crutches.

   Oh, for more of these Bethel visits, more frequent visitations from the
   God of Israel! Oh, how sweet to hear Him say to us, as He did to
   Abraham, "Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
   reward." (Gen. xv. 1.) To be addressed as Daniel was of old, "O man
   greatly beloved" (Dan. x. 19), is worth a thousand ages of this world's
   joy. What more can a creature want this side of heaven to make him
   peaceful and happy than a plain avowal of love from his Lord's own
   lips? Let me ever hear Thee, speak in mercy to my soul, and, O my Lord,
   I ask no more while here I dwell in the land of my pilgrimage!

   Brethren, let us labour to obtain a confident assurance of the Lord's
   delight in us, for this, as it enables Him to commune with us, will be
   one of the readiest ways to produce a like feeling in our hearts
   towards Him. Christ is well pleased with us; let us approach Him with
   holy familiarity; let us unbosom our thoughts to Him, for His delight
   in us will secure us an audience. The child may stay away from the
   father, when he is conscious that he has aroused his father's
   displeasure, but why should we keep at a distance when Christ Jesus is
   smiling upon us? No! since His smiles attract us, let us enter into His
   courts, and touch His golden sceptre. O Holy Spirit, help us to live in
   happy fellowship with Him whose soul is knit unto us!

   "O Jesus! let eternal blessings dwell

   On Thy transporting name. * * *

   Let me be wholly Thine from this blest hour.

   Let Thy lov'd image be for ever present;

   Of Thee be all my thoughts, and let my tongue

   Be sanctified with the celestial theme.

   Dwell on my lips, Thou dearest, sweetest name!

   Dwell on my lips, till the last parting breath!

   Then let me die, and bear the charming sound

   In triumph to the skies. In other strains,

   In language all divine, I'll praise Thee then;

   While all the Godhead opens in the view

   Of a Redeemer's love. Here let me gaze,

   For ever gaze; the bright variety

   Will endless joy and admiration yield.

   Let me be wholly Thine from this blest hour.

   Fly from my soul all images of sense,

   Leave me in silence to possess my Lord:

   My life, my pleasures, flow from Him alone,

   My strength, my great salvation, and my hope.

   Thy name is all my trust; O name divine!

   Be Thou engraven on my inmost soul,

   And let me own Thee with my latest breath,

   Confess Thee in the face of ev'ry horror,

   That threat'ning death or envious hell can raise;

   Till all their strength subdu'd, my parting soul

   Shall give a challenge to infernal rage,

   And sing salvation to the Lamb for ever."

                               THE WELL-BELOVED.

  A COMMUNION ADDRESS AT MENTONE."Yea, He is altogether lovely."--Song of
  Solomon v. 16.

THE WELL-BELOVED.

   THE soul that is familiar with the Lord worships Him in the outer court
   of nature, wherein it admires His works, and is charmed by every
   thought of what He must be who made them all. When that soul enters the
   nearer circle of inspiration, and reads the wonderful words of God, it
   is still more enraptured, and its admiration is heightened. In
   revelation, we see the same all-glorious Lord as in creation, but the
   vision is more clear, and the consequent love is more intense.

   The Word is an inner court to the Creation; but there is yet an
   innermost sanctuary, and blessed are they who enter it, and have
   fellowship with the Lord Himself. We come to Christ, and in coming to
   Him we come to God; for Jesus says, "He that hath seen Me hath seen the
   Father." When we know the Lord Jesus, we stand before the mercy-seat,
   where the glory of Jehovah shineth forth. I like to think of the text
   as belonging to those who are as priests unto God, and stand in the
   Holy of holies, while they say, "Yea, He is altogether lovely." His
   works are marvellous, His words are full of majesty, but He Himself is
   altogether lovely.

   Can we come into this inner circle? All do not enter here. Alas! many
   are far off from Him, and are blind to His beauties. "He was despised
   and rejected of men," and He is so still. They do not see God in His
   works, but dream that these wonders were evolved, and not created by
   the Great Primal Cause. As for His words, they seem to them as idle
   tales, or, at best, as inspired only in the same sense as the language
   of Shakespeare or Spenser. They see not the Lord in the stately aisles
   of Holy Scripture; and have no vision of Himself. May He, who openeth
   the eyes of the blind, have pity on them!

   Certain others are in a somewhat happier position, for they are
   enquirers after Christ. They are like the persons who, in the ninth
   verse of the chapter, asked, "What is thy Beloved more than another
   beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy Beloved more than
   another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?" They want to know who
   this Jesus is. But they have not seen Him yet, and cannot join with the
   spouse in saying, "He is altogether lovely."

   If we enter this sacred inner circle, we must become witnesses, as she
   does who speaks of Christ, "Yea, He is altogether lovely." She knows
   what He is, for she has seen Him. The verses which precede the text are
   a description of every feature of the heavenly Bridegroom; all His
   members are there set forth with richness of Oriental imagery. The
   spouse speaks what she knows. Have we, also, seen the Lord? Are we His
   familiar acquaintances? If so, may the Lord help us to understand our
   text!

   If we are to know the full joy of the text, we must come to our Lord as
   His intimates. He permits us this high honour, since, in this
   ordinance, He makes us His table-companions. He says, "Henceforth I
   call you not servants; but I have called you friends." He calls upon us
   to eat bread with Him; yea, to partake of Himself, by eating His flesh
   and drinking His blood. Oh, that we may pass beyond the outward signs
   into the closest intimacy with Himself! Perhaps, when you are at home,
   you will examine the spouse's description of her Lord. It is a
   wonderful piece of tapestry. She has wrought into its warp and woof all
   things charming, sweet, and precious. In Him she sees all lovely
   colours,--"My Beloved is white and ruddy." In comparison with Him all
   others fail, for He is "chief among ten thousand" chieftains. She
   cannot think of Him as comparable to anything less valuable than "fine
   gold." She sees, soaring in the air, birds of divers wing; and these
   must aid her, whether it be the raven or the dove. The rivers of
   waters, and the beds of spices and myrrh-dropping lilies, must come
   into the picture, with sweet flowers and goodly cedars. All kinds of
   treasured things are in Him; for He is like to gold rings set with the
   beryl, and bright ivory overlaid with sapphires, and pillars of marble
   set upon sockets of fine gold. She labours to describe His beauty and
   His excellency, and strains all comparisons to their utmost use, and
   somewhat more; and yet she is conscious of failure, and therefore sums
   up all with the pithy sentence, "Yea, He is altogether lovely."

   If the Holy Spirit will help me, I should like to lift the veil, that
   we may, in sacred contemplation, look on our Beloved.

   I. We would do so, first, with reverent emotions. In the words before
   us, "Yea, He is altogether lovely," two emotions are displayed, namely,
   admiration and affection.

   It is admiration which speaks of Him as "altogether lovely" or
   beautiful. This admiration rises to the highest degree. The spouse
   would fain show that her Beloved is more than any other beloved;
   therefore she cries, "He is altogether lovely." Surely no one else has
   reached that point. Many are lovely, but no one save Jesus is
   "altogether lovely." We see something that is lovely in one, and
   another point is lovely in another; but all loveliness meets in Him.
   Our soul knows nothing which can rival Him: He is the gathering up of
   all sorts of loveliness to make up one perfect loveliness. He is the
   climax of beauty; the crown of glory; the uttermost of excellence.

   Our admiration of Him, also, is unrestrained. The spouse dared to say,
   even in the presence of the daughters of Jerusalem, who were somewhat
   envious, "Yea, He is altogether lovely." They knew not, as yet, His
   perfections; they even asked, "What is thy Beloved more than another
   beloved?" But she was not to be blinded by their want of sympathy,
   neither did she withhold her testimony from fear of their criticism. To
   her, He was "altogether lovely", and she could say no less. Our
   admiration of Christ is such that we would tell the kings of the earth
   that they have no majesty in His presence; and tell the wise men that
   He alone is wisdom; and tell the great and mighty that He is the
   blessed and only Potentate, King of kings, and Lord of lords.

   Our admiration of our Lord is inexpressible. We can never tell all we
   know of our Lord; yet all our knowledge is little. All that we know is,
   that His love passeth knowledge, that His excellence baffles
   understanding, that His glory is unutterable. We can embrace Him by our
   love, but we can scarcely touch Him with our intellect, He is so high,
   so glorious. As to describing Him, we cry, with Mr. Berridge,--

   "Then my tongue would fain express

   All His love and loveliness;

   But I lisp, and falter forth

   Broken words, not half His worth.

   "Vex'd, I try and try again,

   Still my efforts all are vain:

   Living tongues are dumb at best,

   We must die to speak of Christ."

   "He is altogether lovely." Do we not feel an inexpressible admiration
   for Him? There is none like unto Thee, O Son of God!

   Still, our paramount emotion is not admiration, but affection. "He is
   altogether"--not beautiful, nor admirable,--but "lovely." All His
   beauties are loving beauties towards us, and beauties which draw our
   hearts towards Him in humble love. He charms us, not by a cold
   comeliness, but by a living loveliness, which wins our hearts. His is
   an approachable beauty, which not only overpowers us with its glory,
   but holds us captive by its charms. We love Him: we cannot do
   otherwise, for "He is altogether lovely." He has within Himself an
   unquenchable flame of love, which sets our soul on fire. He is all
   love, and all the love in the world is less than His. Put together all
   the loves of husband wives, parents, children, brothers, sisters, and
   they only make a drop compared with His great deeps of love, unexplored
   and unexplorable. This love of His has a wonderful power to beget love
   in unlovely hearts, and to nourish it into a mighty force. " It is a
   torrent which sweeps all before it when its founts break forth within
   the soul. It is a Gulf Stream in which all icebergs melt. When our
   heart is full of love to Jesus, His loveliness becomes the passion of
   the soul, and sin and self are swept away. May we feel it now!

   There He stands: we know Him by the thorn-crown, and the wounds, and
   the visage more marred than that of any man! He suffered all this for
   us. O Son of man! O Son of God! With the spouse, we feel, in the inmost
   depths of our soul, that Thou art "altogether lovely."

   II. Now would I lift the veil a second time, with deep solemnity, not
   so much to suggest emotions as to secure your intelligent assurance of
   the fact that "He is altogether lovely." We say this with absolute
   certainty. The spouse places a "Yea" before her enthusiastic
   declaration, because she is sure of it. She sees her Beloved, and sees
   Him to be altogether lovely. This is no fiction, no dream, no freak of
   imagination, no outburst of partiality. The highest love to Christ does
   not make us speak more than the truth; we are as reasonable when we are
   filled with love to Him as ever we were in our lives; nay, never are we
   more reasonable than when we are carried clean away by a clear
   perception of His superlative excellence.

   Let us meditate upon the proof of our assertion. "He is altogether
   lovely" in His person. He is God. The glory of Godhead I must leave in
   lowly silence. Yet is our Jesus also man, more emphatically man than
   any one here present this afternoon, for we are English, American,
   French, German, Dutch, Russian; but Christ is man, the second Adam, the
   Head of the race: as truly as He is very God of very God, so is He man,
   of the substance of His mother. What a marvellous union! The miracle of
   miracles! In his incomparible personality He is altogether lovely; for
   in Him we see how God comes down to man in condescension, and how man
   goes up to God in close relationship. There is no other such as He, in
   all respects, even in heaven itself: in His personality He must ever
   stand alone, in the eyes of both God and man, "altogether lovely."

   As for His character, time would fail us to enter upon that vast
   subject; but the more we know of the character of our Lord, and the
   more we grow like Him, the more lovely will it appear to us. In all
   aspects, it is lovely; in all its minutiae and details, it is perfect;
   and as a whole, it is perfection's model. Take any one action of His,
   look into its mode, its spirit, its motive, and all else that can be
   revealed by a microscopic examination, and it is "altogether lovely."
   Consider his life, as a whole, in reference to God, to man, to His
   friends, to His foes, to those around Him, and to the ages yet to be,
   and you shall find it absolutely perfect. More than that: there is such
   a thing as a cold perfection, with which one can find no fault, and yet
   it commands no love; but in Christ, our Well-beloved, every part of His
   character attracts. To a true heart, the life of Christ is as much an
   object of love as of reverence: "He is altogether lovely." We must love
   that which we see in Him: admiration is not the word. When cold critics
   commend Him, their praise is half an insult: what know these frozen
   hearts of our Beloved? As for a word against Him, it wounds us to the
   soul. Even an omission of His praise is a torture to us. If we hear a
   sermon which has no Christ in it, we weary of it. If we read a book
   that contains a slighting syllable of Him, we abhor it. He, Himself,
   has become everything to us now, and only in the atmosphere of fervent
   love to Him can we feel at home.

   Passing from His character to His sacrifice; there especially "He is
   altogether lovely." You may have read "Rutherford's Letters"; I hope
   you have. How wondrously he writes, when he describes his Lord in
   garments red from His sweat of blood, and with hands bejewelled with
   His wounds! When we view His body taken down from the cross, all pale
   and deathly, and wrapped in the cerements of the grave, we see a
   strange beauty in Him. He is to us never more lovely than when we read
   in our Beloved's white and red that His Sacrifice is accomplished, and
   He has been obedient unto death for us. In Him, as the sacrifice once
   offered, we see our pardon, our life, our heaven, our all. So lovely is
   Christ in His sacrifice, that He is for ever most pleasing to the great
   Judge of all, ay, so lovely to His Father, that He makes us also lovely
   to God the Father, and we are "accepted in the Beloved." His sacrifice
   has such merit and beauty in the sight of heaven, that in Him God is
   well pleased, and guilty men become in Him pleasant unto the Lord. Is
   not His sacrifice most sweet to us? Here our guilty conscience finds
   peace; here we see ourselves made comely in His comeliness. We cannot
   stand at Calvary, and see the Saviour die, and hear Him cry, "It is
   finished," without feeling that "He is altogether lovely." Forgive me
   that I speak so coolly! I dare not enter fully into a theme which would
   pull up the sluices of my heart.

   Remember what He was when He rose from the grave on the third day. Oh,
   to have seen Him in the freshness of His resurrection beauty! And what
   will He be in His glory, when He comes again the second time, and all
   His holy angels with Him, when He shall sit upon the throne of His
   glory, and heaven and earth shall flee away before His face? To His
   people He will then be "altogether lovely." Angels will adore Him,
   saints made perfect will fall on their faces before Him; and we
   ourselves shall feel that, at last, our heaven is complete. We shall
   see Him, and being like Him, we shall be satisfied.

   Every feature of our Lord is lovely. You cannot think of anything that
   has to do with Him which is unworthy of our praise. All over glorious
   is our Lord. The spouse speaks of His head, His locks, His eyes, His
   cheeks, His lips, His hands, His legs, His countenance, His mouth; and
   when she has mentioned them all, she sums up with reference to all by
   saying, "Yea, He is altogether lovely."

   There is nothing unlovely about Him. Certain persons would be beautiful
   were it not for a wound or a bruise, but our Beloved is all the more
   lovely for His wounds; the marring of His countenance has enhanced its
   charms. His scars are, for glory and for beauty, the jewels of our
   King. To us He is lovely even from that side which others dread: His
   very frown has comfort in it to His saints, since He only frowns on
   evil. Even His feet, which are "like unto fine brass, as if they burned
   in a furnace," are lovely to us for His sake; these are His poor
   saints, who are sorely tried, but are able to endure the fire.
   Everything of Christ, everything that partakes of Christ, everything
   that hath a flavour or savour of Christ, is lovely to us.

   There is nothing lacking about His loveliness. Some would be very
   lovely were there a brightness in their eyes, or a colour in their
   countenances: but something is away. The absence of a tooth or of an
   eyebrow may spoil a countenance, but in Christ Jesus there is no
   omission of excellence. Everything that should be in Him is in Him;
   everything that is conceivable in perfection is present to perfection
   in Him.

   In Him is nothing excessive. Many a face has one feature in it which is
   overdone; but in our Lord's character everything is balanced and
   proportionate. You never find His kindness lessening His holiness, nor
   His holiness eclipsing His wisdom, nor His wisdom abating His courage,
   nor His courage injuring His meekness. Everything is in our Lord that
   should be there, and everything in due measure. Like rare spices, mixed
   after the manner of the apothecary, our Lord's whole person, and
   character, and sacrifice, are as incense sweet unto the Lord.

   Neither is there anything in our Lord which is incongruous with the
   rest. In each one of us there is, at least, a little that is out of
   place. We could not be fully described without the use of a "but." If
   we could all look within, and see ourselves as God sees us, we should
   note a thousand matters, which we now permit, which we should never
   allow again. But in the Well-beloved all is of a piece, all is lovely;
   and when the sum of the whole is added up, it comes to an absolute
   perfection of loveliness: "Yea, He is altogether lovely."

   We are sure that the Lord Jesus must be Himself exceedingly lovely,
   since He gives loveliness to His people. Many saints are lovely in
   their lives; one reads biographies of good men and women which make us
   wish to grow like them; yet all the loveliness of all the most holy
   among men has come from Jesus their Lord, and is a copy of His perfect
   beauty. Those who write well do so because He sets the copy.

   What is stranger and more wonderful still, our Lord Jesus makes sinners
   lovely. In their natural state, men are deformed and hideous to the eye
   of God; and as they have no love to God, so He has no delight in them.
   He is weary of them, and is grieved that He made men upon the earth.
   The Lord is angry with the wicked every day. Yet, when our Lord Jesus
   comes in, and covers these sinful ones with His righteousness, and, at
   the same time, infuses into them His life, the Lord is well pleased
   with them for His Son's sake. Even in heaven, the infinite Jehovah sees
   nothing which pleases Him like His Son. The Father from eternity loved
   His Only-begotten, and again and again He hath said of Him, "This is My
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." What higher encomium can be
   passed upon Him?

   If we had time to think over this subject, we should say of our Lord
   that He is lovely in every office. He is the most admirable Priest, and
   King, and Prophet that ever yet exercised the office. He is a lovely
   Shepherd of a chosen flock, a lovely Friend, lovely Husband, a lovely
   Brother: He is admirable in every position that He occupies for our
   sakes.

   Our Lord's loveliness appears in every condition: in the manger, or in
   the temple; by the well, or on the sea; in the garden, or on the cross;
   in the tomb, or in the resurrection; in His first, or in His second
   coming. He is not as the herb, which flowers only at one season; or as
   the tree, which loses its leaves in winter; or as the moon, which waxes
   and wanes; or as the sea, which ebbs and flows. In every condition, and
   at every time, "He is altogether lovely."

   He is lovely, whichever way we look at Him. If we view Him as in the
   past, entering into a covenant of peace on our behalf; or, in the
   present, yielding Himself to us as Intercessor, Representative, and
   Forerunner; or, in the future, coming, reigning, and glorifying His
   people; "He is altogether lovely." Behold Him from heaven, view Him
   from the gates of hell, regard Him as he goes before, look up to Him as
   He sits above; He is as beautiful from one point of view as from
   another; "Yea, He is altogether lovely." Wherever we may be, He is the
   same in His perfection. How lovely He was to my eyes when I was sinking
   in despair! To see Him suffering for my sin upon the tree, was as the
   opening of the gates of the morning to my darkened soul. How lovely He
   is to us when we are sick, and the hours of night seem lengthened into
   days! "He giveth songs in the night." How lovely has He been to us when
   the world has frowned, and friends have forsaken, and worldly goods
   have been scant! To see "the King in His beauty" is a sight sufficient,
   even if we never saw another ray of comfort. How blessed, when we lie
   dying, to hear Him say, "I am the resurrection and the life"! Mark that
   word; He says not, "I will give you resurrection and life," but, "I am
   the resurrection and the life." Blessed are the eyes which can see that
   in Jesus which is really in Him. When we think of seeing Him as He is,
   and being like Him, how heaven approaches us! We shall soon behold the
   beatific vision, of which He will be the centre and the sun. At the
   thought thereof our soul takes wing, and our imagination soars aloft,
   while our faith, with eagle eye, beholds the glory. As we think of that
   glad period, when we shall be with our Beloved for ever, we are ready
   to swoon away with delight. It is near, far nearer than we think.

   III. The little time which we can give to this meditation has run out,
   and therefore I hasten to a close. I have bidden you look at our Lord
   as "altogether lovely" with reverent emotions, and with absolute
   certainty. Now, to conclude, think of Him with practical results. "He
   is altogether lovely." What shall we do for this chief among ten
   thousand?

   First, we will tell others of Him. For that cause was our text spoken.
   The daughters of Jerusalem asked the spouse, "What is thy Beloved more
   than another beloved?" Her answer is here: "He is altogether lovely."
   It is a great joy to praise our Lord to enquiring minds. We, who are
   preachers, have a glorious time of it when we extol our Lord. If we had
   nothing to do but to preach Christ, and had no discipline to
   administer, no sin to battle with, no doubts to drive away, we should
   have a heavenly service. For my part, I wish I could be bound over to
   play only upon this one string. Paul did well when he turned ignoramus,
   and determined to know nothing among the Corinthians save Jesus Christ,
   and Him crucified. As the harp of Anacreon would resound love alone, so
   would I have but one sole subject for my ministry,--the love and
   loveliness of my Lord. Then to speak would be its own reward; and to
   study and prepare discourses would be only a phase of rest. Fain would
   I make my whole ministry to speak of Christ and His surpassing
   loveliness.

   You who are not preachers cannot do better than speak much of Jesus, as
   opportunity offers. Make Him the theme of conversation. People talk
   about ministers; but we beg you to talk of our Master. Our undecided
   neighbours are always talking of hypocrites and inconsistent
   professors; but we would say to them, "Never mind about His followers:
   talk about the Master Himself." His followers, by themselves
   considered, never were worth your words; but what a theme is this,--"He
   is altogether lovely"! Our Lord's people are far worthier than the
   world thinks them to be; for my part, I rejoice in the many gracious
   and beautiful characters with which I meet, but even if all the ill
   reports we hear were true, this would not detract from the loveliness
   of our Lord, who is infinitely beyond all praise.

   The next practical result of viewing the loveliness of our blessed Lord
   is, that we appropriate Him to ourselves, grasping Him with our two
   hands of faith and love, and making the rest of the verse to be our
   own: "This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O daughters of
   Jerusalem!" Since He is so amiable, He must be "my Beloved"; my heart
   clings to Him. Since He is admirable, I rejoice that He is "my Friend";
   my soul trusts in Him. The heart that most appreciates Jesus is the
   most eager to appropriate Him. He who beholds Jesus as "altogether
   lovely" will never rest till he is altogether sure that Jesus is
   altogether his own. I think I may also add that appreciation is in
   great measure the seal of appropriation, for the soul that values
   Christ most is the soul that hath most surely taken possession of
   Christ. Sometimes a heart prizes the Lord very highly, and tremblingly
   longs for Him; but it is my conviction that the very fact of prizing
   Him argues a measure of possession of Him. Jesus never wins a heart to
   which He refuses His love. If thou lovest Him, He loves thee: be sure
   of that. No soul ever cries, "Yea, He is altogether lovely," without
   sooner or later adding, "This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend."

   Rest not, any one of you, till you know of a surety that Jesus is
   yours. Do not be content with a hope, struggle after the full assurance
   of faith. This is to be had, and you ought not to be content without
   it. It may be your lifelong song, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His."
   You need not pine in the shade: the sun is shining, "walk in the
   light." Away with the idea that we cannot know whether we are condemned
   or forgiven, in Christ or out of Him! We may know, we must know; and,
   as we appreciate our Lord, we shall know. Either Jesus is ours, or He
   is not. If He is, let us rejoice in the priceless possession. If He is
   not ours, let us at once lay hold upon Him by faith; for, the moment we
   trust Him, He is ours. The enjoyment of religion lies in assurance: a
   mere hope is scant diet.

   Once more, it is a fair fruit of our delight in our Lord that our
   valuation of Him becomes a bond of union between us and others. The
   spouse cries, "This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O daughters
   of Jerusalem!" and they reply, "Whither is thy Beloved gone, O thou
   fairest among women? Whither is thy Beloved turned aside, that we may
   seek Him with thee?" Thus, you see, they institute a companionship
   through the Well-beloved. Few of us, in this room, would ever have
   known each other, had it not been for our common admiration of the Lord
   Jesus. We should have gone on walking past each other by the sea to
   this day, and we should have missed much cheering fellowship. Our Lord
   has become our centre; we meet in Him, and feel that in Him we are
   partakers of one life. We seek our Well-beloved together, and around
   His table we find Him together; and finding Him, we have found one
   another, and the lost jewel of Christian love glitters on every bosom.
   We have differing views on certain parts of divine truth; and I do not
   know that it is wrong for us to differ where the Holy Spirit has left
   truth without rigidly defining it. We are bound each one devoutly to
   use his judgment in the interpretation of the Sacred Word; but we all
   agree in this one clear judgment: "Yea, He is altogether lovely." This
   is the point of union. Those who enthusiastically love the same person
   are on the way to loving each other. This is growingly our case; and it
   is the same with all spiritual people. Professors quarrel, but
   possessors are at one. We hear much discourse upon "the Unity of the
   Church" as a thing to be desired, and we may heartily agree with it;
   but it would be well also to remember that in the true Church of Christ
   real union already exists. Our Lord prayed for those whom the Father
   had given Him, that they might be one, and the Father granted the
   prayer: the Lord's own people are one. In this room we have an example
   of how closely we are united in Christ. Some of you are more at home in
   this assembly, taken out of all churches, than you are in the churches
   to which you nominally belong. Our union in one body as Episcopalians,
   Baptists, Presbyterians, or Independents, is not the thing which our
   Lord prayed for; but our union in Himself. That union we do at this
   moment enjoy; and therefore do we eat of one bread, and drink of one
   cup, and are baptized into one Spirit, at His feet who is to each one
   of us, and so to all of us, altogether lovely.

   "White and ruddy is my Belov'd,

   All His heavenly beauties shine;

   Nature can't produce an object,

   Nor so glorious, so divine;

   He hath wholly

   Won my soul to realms above.

   "Farewell, all ye meaner creatures,

   For in Him is every store;

   Wealth, or friends, or darling beauty,

   Shall not draw me any more;

   In my Saviour

   I have found a glorious whole."

                       THE SPICED WINE OF MY POMEGRANATE;

  OR, THE COMMUNION OF COMMUNICATION. I would cause Thee to drink of spiced wine
  of the juice of my pomegranate."--Song of Solomon viii. 2.And of His fulness
  have all we received, and grace for grace."--John i. 16.

THE SPICED WINE OF MY POMEGRANATE.

   THE immovable basis of communion having been laid of old in the eternal
   union which subsisted between Christ and His elect, it only needed a
   fitting occasion to manifest itself in active development. The Lord
   Jesus had for ever delighted Himself with the sons of men, and he ever
   stood prepared to reveal and communicate that delight to His people;
   but they were incapable of returning His affection or enjoying His
   fellowship, having fallen into a state so base and degraded, that they
   were dead to Him, and careless concerning Him. It was therefore needful
   that something should be done for them, and in them, before they could
   hold converse with Jesus, or feel concord with Him. This preparation
   being a work of grace and a result of previous union, Jesus determined
   that, even in the preparation for communion, there should be communion.
   If they must be washed before they could fully converse with Him, He
   would commune with them in the washing; and if they must be enriched by
   gifts before they could have full access to Him, He would commune with
   them in the giving. He has therefore established a fellowship in
   imparting His grace, and in partaking of it.

   This order of fellowship we have called "The Communion of
   Communication," and we think that a few remarks will prove that we are
   not running beyond the warranty of Scripture.

   The word koinwnia, or communion, is frequently employed by inspired
   writers in the sense of communication or contribution. When, in our
   English version, we read, "For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and
   Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at
   Jerusalem" (Romans xv. 26), it is interesting to know that the word
   koinwnian is used, as if to show that the generous gifts of the Church
   in Achaia to its sister Church at Jerusalem was a communion. Calvin
   would have us notice this, because, saith he, "The word here employed
   well expresses the feeling by which it behoves us to succour the wants
   of our brethren, even because there is to be a common and mutual regard
   on account of the union of the body." He would not have strained the
   text if he had said that there was in the contribution the very essence
   of communion. Gill, in his commentary upon the above verse, most
   pertinently remarks, "Contribution, or communion, as the word
   signifies, it being one part of the communion of churches and of saints
   to relieve their poor by communicating to them." The same word is
   employed in Hebrews xiii. 16, and is there translated by the word
   "communicate." "But to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for
   with such sacrifices God is well pleased." It occurs again in 2
   Corinthians ix. 13, "And for your liberal distribution unto them, and
   unto all men;" and in numerous other passages the careful student will
   observe the word in various forms, representing the ministering of the
   saints to one another as an act of fellowship. Indeed, at the Lord's
   supper, which is the embodiment of communion, we have ever been wont to
   make a special contribution for the poor of the flock, and we believe
   that in the collection there is as true and real an element of
   communion as in the partaking of the bread and wine. The giver holds
   fellowship with the receiver when he bestows his benefaction for the
   Lord's sake, and because of the brotherhood existing between him and
   his needy friends. The teacher holds communion with the young disciple
   when he labours to instruct him in the faith, being moved thereto by a
   spirit of Christian love. He who intercedes for a saint because he
   desires his well-being as a member of the one family, enters into
   fellowship with his brother in the offering of prayer. The loving and
   mutual service of church-members is fellowship of a high degree. And
   let us remember that the recipient communes with the benefactor: the
   communion is not confined to the giver, but the heart overflowing with
   liberality is met by the heart brimming with gratitude, and the love
   manifested in the bestowal is reciprocated in the acceptance. When the
   hand feeds the mouth or supports the head, the divers members feel
   their union, and sympathize with one another; and so is it with the
   various portions of the body of Christ, for they commune in mutual acts
   of love.

   Now, this meaning of the word communion furnishes us with much
   instruction, since it indicates the manner in which recognized
   fellowship with Jesus is commenced and maintained, namely, by giving
   and receiving, by communication and reception. The Lord's supper is the
   divinely-ordained exhibition of communion, and therefore in it there is
   the breaking of bread and the pouring forth of wine, to picture the
   free gift of the Saviour's body and blood to us; and there is also the
   eating of the one and the drinking of the other, to represent the
   reception of these priceless gifts by us. As without bread and wine
   there could be no Lord's supper, so without the gracious bequests of
   Jesus to us there would have been no communion between Him and our
   souls: and as participation is necessary before the elements truly
   represent the meaning of the Lord's ordinance, so is it needful that we
   should receive His bounties, and feed upon His person, before we can
   commune with Him.

   It is one branch of this mutual communication which we have selected as
   the subject of this address. "Looking unto Jesus," who hath delivered
   us from our state of enmity, and brought us into fellowship with
   Himself, we pray for the rich assistance of the Holy Spirit, that we
   may be refreshed in spirit, and encouraged to draw more largely from
   the covenant storehouse of Christ Jesus the Lord.

   We shall take a text, and proceed at once to our delightful task. "And
   of His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace." (John i.
   16.)

   As the life of grace is first begotten in us by the Lord Jesus, so is
   it constantly sustained by Him. We are always drawing from this sacred
   fountain, always deriving sap from this divine root; and as Jesus
   communes with us in the bestowing of mercies, it is our privilege to
   hold fellowship with Him in the receiving of them.

   There is this difference between Christ and ourselves, He never gives
   without manifesting fellowship, but we often receive in so ill a manner
   that communion is not reciprocated, and we therefore miss the heavenly
   opportunity of its enjoyment. We frequently receive grace insensibly,
   that is to say, the sacred oil runs through the pipe, and maintains our
   lamp, while we are unmindful of the secret influence. We may also be
   the partakers of many mercies which, through our dulness, we do not
   perceive to be mercies at all; and at other times well-known blessings
   are recognized as such, but we are backward in tracing them to their
   source in the covenant made with Christ Jesus.

   Following out the suggestion of our explanatory preface, we can well
   believe that when the poor saints received the contribution of their
   brethren, many of them did in earnest acknowledge the fellowship which
   was illustrated in the generous offering, but it is probable that some
   of them merely looked upon the material of the gift, and failed to see
   the spirit moving in it. Sensual thoughts in some of the receivers
   might possibly, at the season when the contribution was distributed,
   have mischievously injured the exercise of spirituality; for it is
   possible that, after a period of poverty, they would be apt to give
   greater prominence to the fact that their need was removed than to the
   sentiment of fellowship with their sympathizing brethren. They would
   rather rejoice over famine averted than concerning fellowship
   manifested. We doubt not that, in many instances, the mutual
   benefactions of the Church fail to reveal our fellowship to our poor
   brethren, and produce in them no feelings of communion with the givers.

   Now this sad fact is an illustration of the yet more lamentable
   statement which we have made. We again assert that, as many of the
   partakers of the alms of the Church are not alive to the communion
   contained therein, so the Lord's people are never sufficiently
   attentive to fellowship with Jesus in receiving His gifts, but many of
   them are entirely forgetful of their privilege, and all of them are too
   little aware of it. Nay, worse than this, how often doth the believer
   pervert the gifts of Jesus into food for his own sin and wantonness! We
   are not free from the fickleness of ancient Israel, and well might our
   Lord address us in the same language:

   "Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was
   the time of love; and I spread My skirt over thee, and covered thy
   nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
   Thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest Mine. Then washed I thee
   with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I
   anointed thee with oil. I clothed thee also with broidered work, and
   shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen,
   and I covered thee with silk. I decked thee also with ornaments, and I
   put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. And I put a
   jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful
   crown upon thine head. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and
   thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst
   eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful,
   and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. And thy renown went forth among
   the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through My comeliness,
   which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God. But thou didst trust in
   thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown."
   (Ezek. xvi. 8-16. )

   Ought not the mass of professors to confess the truth of this
   accusation? Have not the bulk of us most sadly departed from the purity
   of our love? We rejoice, however, to observe a remnant of choice
   spirits, who live near the Lord, and know the sweetness of fellowship.
   These receive the promise and the blessing, and so digest them that
   they become good blood in their veins, and so do they feed on their
   Lord that they grow up into Him. Let us imitate those elevated minds,
   and obtain their high delights. There is no reason why the meanest of
   us should not be as David, and David as the servant of the Lord. We may
   now be dwarfs, but growth is possible; let us therefore aim at a higher
   stature. Let the succeeding advice be followed, and, the Holy Spirit
   helping us, we shall have attained thereto.

   Make every time of need a time of embracing thy Lord. Do not leave the
   mercy-seat until thou hast clasped Him in thine arms. In every time of
   need He has promised to give thee grace to help, and what withholdeth
   thee from obtaining sweet fellowship as a precious addition to the
   promised assistance? Be not as the beggar who is content with the alms,
   however grudgingly it may be cast to him; but, since thou art a near
   kinsman, seek a smile and a kiss with every benison He gives thee. Is
   He not better than His mercies? What are they without Him? Cry aloud
   unto Him, and let thy petition reach His ears, "O my Lord, it is not
   enough to be a partaker of Thy bounties, I must have Thyself also; if
   Thou dost not give me Thyself with Thy favours, they are but of little
   use to me! O smile on me, when Thou blessest me, for else I am still
   unblest! Thou puttest perfume into all the flowers of Thy garden, and
   fragrance into Thy spices; if Thou withdrawest Thyself, they are no
   more pleasant to me. Come, then, my Lord, and give me Thy love with Thy
   grace." Take good heed, Christian, that thine own heart is in right
   tune, that when the fingers of mercy touch the strings, they may
   resound with full notes of communion. How sad is it to partake of
   favour without rejoicing in it! Yet such is often the believer's case.
   The Lord casts His lavish bounties at our doors, and we, like churls,
   scarcely look out to thank Him. Our ungrateful hearts and unthankful
   tongues mar our fellowship, by causing us to miss a thousand
   opportunities for exercising it.

   If thou wouldst enjoy communion with the Lord Jesus in the reception of
   His grace, endeavor to be always sensibly drawing supplies from Him.
   Make thy needs public in the streets of thine heart, and when the
   supply is granted, let all the powers of thy soul be present at the
   reception of it. Let no mercy come into thine house unsung. Note in thy
   memory the list of thy Master's benefits. Wherefore should the Lord's
   bounties be hurried away in the dark, or buried in forgetfulness? Keep
   the gates of thy soul ever open, and sit thou by the wayside to watch
   the treasures of grace which God the Spirit hourly conveys into thy
   heart from Jehovah--Jesus, thy Lord.

   Never let an hour pass without drawing upon the bank of heaven. If all
   thy wants seem satisfied, look steadfastly until the next moment brings
   another need, and then delay not, but with this warrant of necessity,
   hasten to thy treasury again. Thy necessities are so numerous that thou
   wilt never lack a reason for applying to the fulness of Jesus; but if
   ever such an occasion should arise, enlarge thine heart, and then there
   will be need of more love to fill the wider space. But do not allow any
   supposititious riches of thine own to suspend thy daily receivings from
   the Lord Jesus. You have constant need of Him. You need His
   intercession, His upholding, His sanctification; you need that He
   should work all your works in you, and that He should preserve you unto
   the day of His appearing. There is not one moment of your life in which
   you can do without Christ. Therefore be always at His door, and the
   wants which you bemoan shall be remembrances to turn your heart unto
   your Saviour. Thirst makes the heart pant for the waterbrooks, and pain
   reminds man of the physician. Let your wants conduct you to Jesus, and
   may the blessed Spirit reveal Him unto you while He lovingly affords
   you the rich supplies of His love! Go, poor saint, let thy poverty be
   the cord to draw thee to thy rich Brother. Rejoice in the infirmity
   which makes room for grace to rest upon thee, and be glad that thou
   hast constant needs which compel thee perpetually to hold fellowship
   with thine adorable Redeemer.

   Study thyself, seek out thy necessities, as the housewife searches for
   chambers where she may bestow her summer fruits. Regard thy wants as
   rooms to be filled with more of the grace of Jesus, and suffer no
   corner to be unoccupied. Pant after more of Jesus. Be covetous after
   Him. Let all the past incite thee to seek greater things. Sing the song
   of the enlarged heart,--

   "All this is not enough: methinks I grow

   More greedy by fruition; what I get

   Serves but to set

   An edge upon my appetite;

   And all Thy gifts invite

   My pray'rs for more."

   Cry out to the Lord Jesus to fill the dry beds of thy rivers until they
   overflow, and then empty thou the channels which have hitherto been
   filled with thine own self-sufficiency, and beseech Him to fill these
   also with His superabundant grace. If thy heavy trials sink thee deeper
   in the flood of His consolations, be glad of them; and if thy vessel
   shall be sunken up to its very bulwarks, be not afraid. I would be glad
   to feel the mast-head of my soul twenty fathoms beneath the surface of
   such an ocean; for, as Rutherford said, "Oh, to be over the ears in
   this well! I would not have Christ's love entering into me, but I would
   enter into it, and be swallowed up of that love." Cultivate an
   insatiable hunger and a quenchless thirst for this communion with Jesus
   through His communications. Let thine heart cry for ever, "Give, give,"
   until it is filled in Paradise.

   "O'ercome with Jesu's condescending love,

   Brought into fellowship with Him and His,

   And feasting with Him in His house of wine,

   I'm sick of love,--and yet I pant for more

   Communications from my loving Lord.

   Stay me with flagons full of choicest wine,

   Press'd from His heart upon Mount Calvary,

   To cheer and comfort my love-conquer'd soul.

   Thyself I crave!

   Thy presence is my life, my joy, my heav'n,

   And all, without Thyself, is dead to me.

   Stay me with flagons, Saviour, hear my cry,

   Let promises, like apples, comfort me;

   Apply atoning blood, and cov'nant love,

   Until I see Thy face among the guests

   Who in Thy Father's kingdom feast."

   (Nymphas, by JOSEPH IRONS.)

   This is the only covetousness which is allowable: but this is not
   merely beyond rebuke, it is worthy of commendation. O saints, be not
   straitened in your own bowels, but enlarge your desires, and so receive
   more of your Saviour's measureless fulness! I charge thee, my soul,
   thus to hold continual fellowship with thy Lord, since He invites and
   commands thee thus to partake of His riches.

   Rejoice thyself in benefits received. Let the satisfaction of thy
   spirit overflow in streams of joy. When the believer reposes all his
   confidence in Christ, and delights himself in Him, there is an exercise
   of communion. If he forgetteth his psalm-book, and instead of singing
   is found lamenting, the mercies of the day will bring no communion.
   Awake, O music! stir up thyself, O my soul, be glad in the Lord, and
   exceedingly rejoice! Behold His favours, rich, free, and continual;
   shall they be buried in unthankfulness? Shall they be covered with a
   winding-sheet of ingratitude? No! I will praise Him. I must extol Him.
   Sweet Lord Jesus, let me kiss the dust of Thy feet, let me lose myself
   in thankfulness, for Thy thoughts unto me are precious, how great is
   the sum of them! Lo, I embrace Thee in the arms of joy and gratitude,
   and herein I find my soul drawn unto Thee!

   This is a blessed method of fellowship. It is kissing the divine lip of
   benediction with the sanctified lip of affection. Oh, for more
   rejoicing grace, more of the songs of the heart, more of the melody of
   the soul!

   Seek to recognize the source of thy mercies as lying alone in Him who
   is our Head. Imitate the chicken, which, every time it drinketh of the
   brook, lifts up its head to heaven, as if it would return thanks for
   every drop. If we have anything that is commendable and gracious, it
   must come from the Holy Spirit, and that Spirit is first bestowed on
   Jesus, and then through Him on us. The oil was first poured on the head
   of Aaron, and thence it ran down upon his garments. Look on the drops
   of grace, and remember that they distil from the Head, Christ Jesus.
   All thy rays are begotten by this Sun of Righteousness, all thy showers
   are poured from this heaven, all thy fountains spring from this great
   and immeasurable depth. Oh, for grace to see the hand of Jesus on every
   favour! So will communion be constantly and firmly in exercise. May the
   great Teacher perpetually direct us to Jesus by making the mercies of
   the covenant the handposts on the road which leadeth to Him. Happy is
   the believer who knows how to find the secret abode of his Beloved by
   tracking the footsteps of His loving providence: herein is wisdom which
   the casual observer of mere second causes can never reach. Labour, O
   Christian, to follow up every clue which thy Master's grace affords
   thee!

   Labour to maintain a sense of thine entire dependence upon His good
   will and pleasure for the continuance of thy richest enjoyments. Never
   try to live on the old manna, nor seek to find help in Egypt. All must
   come from Jesus, or thou art undone for ever. Old anointings will not
   suffice to impart unction to our spirit; thine head must have fresh oil
   poured upon it from the golden horn of the sanctuary, or it will cease
   from its glory. To-day thou mayest be upon the summit of the mount of
   God; but He who has put thee there must keep thee there, or thou wilt
   sink far more speedily than thou dreamest. Thy mountain only stands
   firm when He settles it in its place; if He hide His face, thou wilt
   soon be troubled. If the Saviour should see fit, there is not a window
   through which thou seest the light of heaven which he could not darken
   in an instant. Joshua bade the sun stand still, but Jesus can shroud it
   in total darkness. He can withdraw the joy of thine heart, the light of
   thine eyes, and the strength of thy life; in His hand thy comforts lie,
   and at His will they can depart from thee. Oh! how rich the grace which
   supplies us so continually, and doth not refrain itself because of our
   ingratitude! O Lord Jesus, we would bow at Thy feet, conscious of our
   utter inability to do aught without Thee, and in every favour which we
   are privileged to receive, we would adore Thy blessed name, and
   acknowledge Thine unexhausted love!

   When thou hast received much, admire the all-sufficiency which still
   remaineth undiminished, thus shall you commune with Christ, not only in
   what you obtain from Him, but also in the superabundance which remains
   treasured up in Him. Let us ever remember that giving does not
   impoverish our Lord. When the clouds, those wandering cisterns of the
   skies, have poured floods upon the dry ground, there remains an
   abundance in the storehouse of the rain: so in Christ there is ever an
   unbounded supply, though the most liberal showers of grace have fallen
   ever since the foundation of the earth. The sun is as bright as ever
   after all his shining, and the sea is quite as full after all the
   clouds have been drawn from it: so is our Lord Jesus ever the same
   overflowing fountain of fulness. All this is ours, and we may make it
   the subject of rejoicing fellowship. Come, believer, walk through the
   length and breadth of the land, for as far as the eye can reach, the
   land is thine, and far beyond the utmost range of thine observation it
   is thine also, the gracious gift of thy gracious Redeemer and Friend.
   Is there not ample space for fellowship here?

   Regard every spiritual mercy as an assurance of the Lord's communion
   with thee. When the young man gives jewels to the virgin to whom he is
   affianced, she regards them as tokens of his delight in her. Believer,
   do the same with the precious presents of thy Lord. The common bounties
   of providence are shared in by all men, for the good Householder
   provides water for His swine as well as for His children: such things,
   therefore, are no proof of divine complacency. But thou hast richer
   food to eat; "the children's bread" is in thy wallet, and the heritage
   of the righteous is reserved for thee. Look, then, on every motion of
   grace in thine heart as a pledge and sign of the moving of thy
   Saviour's heart towards thee. There is His whole heart in the bowels of
   every mercy which He sends thee. He has impressed a kiss of love upon
   each gift, and He would have thee believe that every jewel of mercy is
   a token of His boundless love. Look on thine adoption, justification,
   and preservation, as sweet enticements to fellowship. Let every note of
   the promise sound in thine ears like the ringing of the bells of the
   house of thy Lord, inviting thee to come to the banquets of His love.
   Joseph sent to his father asses laden with the good things of Egypt,
   and good old Jacob doubtless regarded them as pledges of the love of
   his son's heart: be sure not to think less of the kindnesses of Jesus.

   Study to know the value of His favours. They are no ordinary things, no
   paste jewels, no mosaic gold: they are every one of them so costly,
   that, had all heaven been drained of treasure, apart from the precious
   offering of the Redeemer, it could not have purchased so much as the
   least of His benefits. When thou seest thy pardon, consider how great a
   boon is contained in it! Bethink thee that hell had been thine eternal
   portion unless Christ had plucked thee from the burning! When thou art
   enabled to see thyself as clothed in the imputed righteousness of
   Jesus, admire the profusion of precious things of which thy robe is
   made. Think how many times the Man of sorrows wearied Himself at that
   loom of obedience in which He wove that matchless garment; and reckon,
   if thou canst, how many worlds of merit were cast into the fabric at
   every throw of the shuttle! Remember that all the angels in heaven
   could not have afforded Him a single thread which would have been rich
   enough to weave into the texture of His perfect righteousness. Consider
   the cost of thy maintenance for an hour; remember that thy wants are so
   large, that all the granaries of grace that all the saints could fill,
   could not feed thee for a moment.

   What an expensive dependent thou art! King Solomon made marvellous
   provision for his household (1 Kings iv. 22), but all his beeves and
   fine flour would be as the drop of the bucket compared with thy daily
   wants. Rivers of oil, and ten thousand rams or fed beasts, would not
   provide enough to supply the necessities of thy hungering soul. Thy
   least spiritual want demands infinity to satisfy it, and what must be
   the amazing aggregate of thy perpetually repeated draughts upon thy
   Lord! Arise, then, and bless thy loving Immanuel for the invaluable
   riches with which He has endowed thee. See what a dowry thy Bridegroom
   has brought to His poor, penniless spouse. He knows the value of the
   blessings which He brings thee, for He has paid for them out of His
   heart's richest blood; be not thou so ungenerous as to pass them over
   as if they were but of little worth. Poor men know more of the value of
   money than those who have always revelled in abundance of wealth. Ought
   not thy former poverty to teach thee the preciousness of the grace
   which Jesus gives thee? For remember, there was a time when thou
   wouldst have given a thousand worlds, if they had been thine, in order
   to procure the very least of His abundant mercies.

   Remember how impossible it would have been for thee to receive a single
   spiritual blessing unless thou hadst been in Jesus. On none of Adam's
   race can the love of God be fixed, unless they are seen to be in union
   with His Son. No exception has ever been made to the universal curse on
   those of the first Adam's seed who have no interest in the second Adam.
   Christ is the only Zoar in which God's Lots can find a shelter from the
   destruction of Sodom. Out of Him, the withering blast of the fiery
   furnace of God's wrath consumes every green herb, and it is only in Him
   that the soul can live. As when the prairie is on fire, men see the
   heavens wrapped in sheets of flame, and in hot haste they fly before
   the devouring element. They have but one hope. There is in the distance
   a lake of water. They reach it, they plunge into it, and are safe.
   Although the skies are molten with the heat, the sun darkened with the
   smoke, and the earth utterly consumed in the fire, they know that they
   are secure while the cooling flood embraces them. Christ Jesus is the
   only escape for a sinner pursued by the fiery wrath of God, and we
   would have the believer remember this. Our own works could never
   shelter us, for they have proved but refuges of lies. Had they been a
   thousand times more and better, they would have been but as the
   spider's web, too flail to hang eternal interests upon. There was but
   one name, one sacrifice, one blood, by which we could escape. All other
   attempts at salvation were a grievous failure. For, "though a man could
   scourge out of his body rivers of blood, and in neglect of himself
   could outlast Moses or Elias; though he could wear out his knees with
   prayer, and had his eyes nailed on heaven; though he could build
   hospitals for all the poor on earth, and exhaust the mines of India in
   alms; though he could walk like an angel of light, and with the
   glittering of an outward holiness dazzle the eyes of all beholders; nay
   (if it were possible to be conceived) though he should live for a
   thousand years in a perfect and perpetual observation of the whole law
   of God, if the only exception to his perfection were the very least
   deviation from the law, yet such a man as this could no more appear
   before the tribunal of God's justice, than stubble before a consuming
   fire." How, then, with thine innumerable sins, couldst thou escape the
   damnation of hell, much less become the recipient of bounties so rich
   and large? Blessed window of heaven, sweet Lord Jesus, let Thy Church
   for ever adore Thee, as the only channel by which mercies can flow to
   her. My soul, give Him continual praise, for without Him thou hadst
   been poorer than a beggar. Be thou mindful, O heir of heaven, that thou
   couldst not have had one ray of hope, or one word of comfort, if thou
   hadst not been in union with Christ Jesus! The crumbs which fall from
   thy table are more than grace itself would have given thee, hadst thou
   not been in Jesus beloved and approved.

   All thou hast, thou hast in Him: in Him chosen, in Him redeemed, in Him
   justified, in Him accepted. Thou art risen in Him, but without Him thou
   hadst died the second death. Thou art in Him raised up to the heavenly
   places, but out of Him thou wouldst have been damned eternally. Bless
   Him, then. Ask the angels to bless Him. Rouse all ages to a harmony of
   praise for His condescending love in taking poor guilty nothings into
   oneness with His all-adorable person. This is a blessed means of
   promoting communion, if the sacred Comforter is pleased to take of the
   things of Christ, and reveal them to us as ours, but only ours as we
   are in Him. Thrice-blessed Jesus, let us never forget that we are
   members of Thy mystical body, and that it is for this reason that we
   are blessed and preserved.

   Meditate upon thee gracious acts which procured thy blessings. Consider
   the ponderous labours which thy Lord endured for thee, and the
   stupendous sufferings by which He purchased the mercies which He
   bestows. What human tongue can speak forth the unutterable misery of
   His heart, or describe so much as one of the agonies which crowded upon
   His soul? How much less shall any finite comprehension arrive at an
   idea of the vast total of His woe! But all His sorrows were necessary
   for thy benefit, and without them not one of thine unnumbered mercies
   could have been bestowed. Be not unmindful that--

   "There's ne'er a gift His hand bestows,

   But cost His heart a groan."

   Look upon the frozen ground of Gethsemane, and behold the bloody sweat
   which stained the soil! Turn to the hall of Gabbatha, and see the
   victim of justice pursued by His clamorous foes! Enter the guard-room
   of the Praetorians, and view the spitting, and the plucking of the
   hair! and then conclude your review upon Golgotha, the mount of doom,
   where death consummated His tortures; and if, by divine assistance thou
   art enabled to enter, in some humble measure, into the depths of thy
   Lord's sufferings, thou wilt be the better prepared to hold fellowship
   with Him when next thou receivest His priceless gifts. In proportion to
   thy sense of their costliness will be thy capacity for enjoying the
   love which is centred in them.

   Above all, and chief of all, never forget that Christ is thine. Amid
   the profusion of His gifts, never forget that the chief gift is
   Himself, and do not forget that, after all, His gifts are but Himself.
   He clothes thee, but it is with Himself, with His own spotless
   righteousness and character. He washes thee, but His innermost self,
   His own heart's blood, is the stream with which the fountain overflows.
   He feeds thee with the bread of heaven, but be not unmindful that the
   bread is Himself, His own body which He gives to be the food of souls.
   Never be satisfied with a less communication than a whole Christ. A
   wife will not be put off with maintenance, jewels, and attire, all
   these will be nothing to her unless she can call her husband's heart
   and person her own. It was the Paschal lamb upon which the ancient
   Israelite did feast on that night that was never to be forgotten. So do
   thou feast on Jesus, and on nothing less than Jesus, for less than this
   will be food too light for thy soul's satisfaction. Oh, be careful to
   eat His flesh and drink His blood, and so receive Him into thyself in a
   real and spiritual manner, for nothing short of this will be an
   evidence of eternal life in thy soul!

   What more shall we add to the rules which we have here delivered? There
   remains but one great exhortation, which must not be omitted. Seek the
   abundant assistance of the Holy Spirit to enable you to put into
   practice the things which we have said, for without His aid, all that
   we have spoken will but be tantalizing the lame with rules to walk, or
   the dying with regulations for the preservation of health. O thou
   Divine Spirit, while we enjoy the grace of Jesus, lead us into the
   secret abode of our Lord, that we may sup with Him, and He with us, and
   grant unto us hourly grace that we may continue in the company of our
   Lord from the rising to the setting of the sun! Amen.

                          THE WELL-BELOVED'S VINEYARD.

  AN ADDRESS TO A LITTLE COMPANY OF BELIEVERS,

  IN MR. SPURGEON'S OWN ROOM AT MENTONE."My Well-beloved hath a vineyard in a
  very fruitful hill."--Isaiah v. 1.

THE WELL-BELOVED'S VINEYARD.

   WE recognize at once that Jesus is here. Who but He can be meant by "My
   Well-beloved"? Here is a word of possession and a word of
   affection,--He is mine, and my Well-beloved. He is loveliness itself,
   the most loving and lovable of beings; and we personally love Him with
   all our heart, and mind, and soul, and strength: He is ours, our
   Beloved, our Well-beloved, we can say no less.

   The delightful relationship of our Lord to us is accompanied by words
   which remind us of our relationship to Him, "My Well-beloved hath a
   vineyard," and what vineyard is that but our heart, our nature, our
   life? We are His: and we are His for the same reason that any other
   vineyard belongs to its owner. He made us a vineyard. Thorns and briars
   were all our growth naturally, but He bought us with a price, He hedged
   us about, and set us apart for Himself, and then He planted and
   cultivated us. All within us that can bring forth good fruit is of His
   creating, His tending, and His preserving; so that if we be vineyards
   at all we must be His vineyards. We gladly agree that it shall be so. I
   pray that I may not have a hair on my head that does not belong to
   Christ, and you all pray that your every pulse and breath may be the
   Lord's.

   This happy afternoon I want you to note that this vineyard is said to
   be upon "a very fruitful hill." I have been thinking of the advantages
   of my own position towards the Lord, and lamenting with great
   shamefacedness that I am not bringing forth such fruit to Him as my
   position demands. Considering our privileges, advantages, and
   opportunities, I fear that many of us have need to feel great
   searchings of heart. Perhaps to such the text may be helpful, and it
   will not be without profit to any one of us, if the Lord will bless our
   meditation upon it.

   I. Our first thought, in considering these words, is that our position
   as the Lord's vineyard is a very favourable one: "My Well-beloved hath
   a vineyard in a very fruitful hill." No people could be better placed
   for serving Christ than we are. I hardly think that any man is better
   situated for glorifying God than I am. I do not think that any women
   could be in better positions for serving Christ than some of you, dear
   sisters, now occupy. Our heavenly Father has placed us just where He
   can do the most for us, and where we can do the most for Him. Infinite
   wisdom has occupied itself with carefully selecting the soil, and site,
   and aspect of every tree in the vineyard. We differ greatly, and need
   differing situations in order to fruitfulness: the place which would
   suit one might be too trying for another. Friend, the Lord has planted
   you in the right spot: your station may not be the best in itself, but
   it is the best for you. We are in the best possible position for some
   present service at this moment; the providence of God has put us on a
   vantage ground for our immediate duty: "My Well-beloved hath a vineyard
   in a very fruitful hill."

   Let us think of the times in which we live as calling upon us to be
   very fruitful when we compare them with the years gone by. Time was
   when we could not have met thus happily in our own room: if we had been
   taken in the act of breaking bread, or reading God's Word, we should
   have been haled off to prison, and perhaps put to death. Our
   forefathers scarcely dared to lift up their voices in a psalm of
   praise, lest the enemy should be upon them. Truly, the lines have
   fallen unto us in pleasant places; yea, we have a goodly heritage, in a
   very fruitful hill.

   We do not even live in times when error is so rampant as to be
   paramount. There is too much of it abroad; but taking a broad view of
   things, I venture to say that there never was a time when the truth had
   a wider sway than it has now, or when the gospel was more fully
   preached, or when there was more spiritual activity. Black clouds of
   error hover over us; but at the same time we rejoice that, from John o'
   Groat's House to the Land's End, Christ is preached by ten thousand
   voices, and even in the dark parts of the earth the name of Jesus is
   shining like a candle in the house. If we had the pick of the ages in
   which to live, we could not have selected a better time for
   fruitbearing than that which is now occurrent: this age is "a very
   fruitful hill."

   That this is the case some of us know positively, because we have been
   fruitful. Look back, brothers and sisters, upon times when your hearts
   were warm, and your zeal was fervent, and you served the Lord with
   gladness. I join with you in those happy memories. Then we could run
   with the swiftest, we could fight with the bravest, we could work with
   the strongest, we could suffer with the most patient. The grace of God
   has been upon certain of us in such an unmistakable manner that we have
   brought forth all the fruits of the Spirit. Perhaps to-day we look back
   with deep regret because we are not so fruitful as we once were: if it
   be so, it is well that our regrets should multiply, but we must change
   each one of them into a hopeful prayer. Remember, the vine may have
   changed, but the soil is the same. We have still the same motives for
   being fruitful, and even more than we used to have. Why are we not more
   useful? Has some spiritual phylloxera taken possession of the vines, or
   have we become frost-bitten, or sun-burnt? What is it that withholds
   the vintage? Certainly, if we were fruitful once, we ought to be more
   fruitful now. The fruitful hill is not exhausted; what aileth us that
   our grapes are so few?

   We are planted on a fruitful hill, for we are called to work which of
   all others is the most fruitful. Blessed and happy is the man who is
   called to the Christian ministry; for this service has brought more
   glory to Christ than any other. You, beloved friends, are not called to
   be rulers of nations, nor inventors of engines, nor teachers of
   sciences, nor slayers of men; but we are soul-winners, our work is to
   lead men to Jesus. Ours is, of all the employments in the world, the
   most fruitful in benefits to men and glory to God. If we are not
   serving God in the gospel of His Son with all our might and ability,
   then we have a heavy responsibility resting upon us. "Our Well-beloved
   hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:" there is not a richer bit of
   soil outside Immanuel's land than the holy ministry for souls. Certain
   of us are teachers, and gather the young about us while we speak of
   Jesus. This also is choice soil. Many teachers have gathered a grand
   vintage from among the little ones, and have not been a whit behind
   pastors and evangelists in the glory of soul-winning. Dear teachers,
   your vines are planted in a very fruitful hill. But I do not confine
   myself to preachers and teachers; for all of us, as we have
   opportunities of speaking for the Lord Jesus Christ, and privately
   talking to individuals, have also a fertile soil to grow in. If we do
   not glorify God by soul-winning, we shall be greatly blamable, since of
   all forms of service it is most prolific in praise of God.

   And what is more, the very circumstances with which we are surrounded
   all tend to make our position exceedingly favourable for fruit-bearing.
   In this little company we have not one friend who is extremely poor;
   but if such were among us, I should say the same thing. Christ has
   gathered some of His choicest clusters from the valley of poverty. Many
   eminent saints have never owned a foot of land, but lived upon their
   weekly wage, and found scant fare at that. Yes, by the grace of God,
   the vale of poverty has blossomed as the rose. It so happens, however,
   that the most of us here have a competence, we have all that we need,
   and something over to give to the poor and to the cause of God. Surely
   we ought to be fruitful in almsgiving, in caring for the sick, and in
   all manner of sweet and flagrant influences. "Give me neither poverty
   nor riches," is a prayer that has been answered for most of us; and if
   we do not now give honour unto God, what excuse can we make for our
   barrenness? I am speaking to some who are singularly healthy, who are
   never hindered by aches and pains; and to others who have been
   prospered in business for twenty years at a stretch: yours is great
   indebtedness to your Lord: in your case, "My Well-beloved hath a
   vineyard in a very fruitful hill." Give God your strength and your
   wealth, my brother, while they last: see that all His care of thee is
   not thrown away. Others of us seldom know many months together of
   health, but have often had to suffer sorely in body; this ought to make
   us fruitful, for there is much increase from the tillage of affliction.
   Has not the Master obtained the richest of all fruit from bleeding
   vines? Do not His heaviest bunches come from vines which have been
   sharply cut and pruned down to the ground? Choice flavours, dainty
   juices, and delicious aromas come mostly from the use of the keen-edged
   knife of trial. Some of us are at our best for fruitbearing when in
   other respects we are at our worst. Thus I might truly say that,
   whatever our circumstances may be, whether we are poor or rich, in
   health or in affliction, each one of our cases has its advantages, and
   we are planted "in a very fruitful hill."

   Furthermore, when I look at our spiritual condition, I must say for
   myself, and I think for you also, "My Well-beloved hath a vineyard in a
   very fruitful hill." For what has God done for us? To change the
   question,--what has God not done for us? What more could He say than to
   us He hath said? What more could He do than to us He hath done? He hath
   dealt with us like a God. He has loved us up from the pit, He has loved
   us up to the cross, and up to the gates of heaven; He has quickened us,
   forgiven us, and renewed us; He dwells in us, comforts us, instructs
   us, upholds us, preserves us, guides us, leads us, and He will surely
   perfect us. If we are not fruitful, to His praise, how shall we excuse
   ourselves? Where shall we hide our guilty heads? Shall yonder sea
   suffice to lend us briny tears wherewith to weep over our ingratitude?

   II. I go a step further, by your leave, and say that our position, as
   the Lord's vineyard, is favourable to the production of the fruit which
   He loves best. I believe that my own position is the most favourable
   for the production of the fruit that the Lord loves best in me, and
   that your position is the same. What is this fruit?

   First, it is faith. Our Lord is very delighted to see faith in His
   people. The trust which clings to Him with childlike confidence is
   pleasant to His loving heart. Our position is such that faith ought to
   be the easiest thing in the world to us. Look at the promises He has
   given us in His Word: can we not believe them? Look at what the Father
   has done for us in the gift of His dear Son: can we not trust Him after
   that? Our daily experience all goes to strengthen our confidence in
   God. Every mercy asks, "Will you not trust Him?" Every want that is
   supplied cries, "Can you not trust Him?" Every sorrow sent by the great
   Father tests our faith, and drives us to Him on whom we repose, and so
   strengthens and confirms our confidence in God. Mercies and miseries
   alike operate for the growth of faith. Some of us have been called upon
   to trust God on a large scale, and that necessity has been a great help
   towards fruit-bearing. The more troubles we have, the more is our vine
   digged about, and the more nourishment is laid to its roots. If faith
   does not ripen under trial, when will it ripen? Our afflictions
   fertilize the soil wherein faith may grow.

   Another choice fruit is love. Jesus delights in love. His tender heart
   delights to see its love returned. Am I not of all men most bound to
   love the Lord? I speak for each brother and sister here, is not that
   your language? Do you not all say, "Lives there a person beneath yon
   blue sky who ought to love Jesus more than I should do?" Each sister
   soliloquizes, "Sat there ever a woman in her chamber who had more
   reason for loving God than I have?" No, the sin which has been forgiven
   us should make us love our Saviour exceeding much. The sin which has
   been prevented in other cases should make us love our Preserver much.
   The help which God has sent us in hours of need, the guidance which He
   has given in times of difficulty, the joy which He has poured into us
   in days of fellowship, and the quiet He has breathed upon us in seasons
   of trial,--all ought to make us love Him. Along our life-road, reasons
   for loving God are more numerous than the leaves upon the olives. He
   has hedged us about with His goodness, even as the mountains and the
   sea are round our present resting-place. Look backward as far as time
   endures, and then look far beyond that, into the eternity which has
   been, and you will see the Lord's great love set upon us: all through
   time and eternity reasons have been accumulating which constrain us to
   love our Lord. Now turn sharply round, and gaze before you, and all
   along the future faith can see reasons for loving God, golden
   milestones on the way that is yet to be traversed, all calling for our
   loving delight in God.

   Christ is also very pleased with the fruit of hope, and we are so
   circumstanced that we ought to produce much of it. The aged ought to
   look forward, for they cannot expect to see much more on earth. Time is
   short, and eternity is near; how precious is a good hope through grace!
   We who are not yet old ought to be exceedingly hopeful; and the younger
   folk, who are just beginning the spiritual life, should abound in hope
   most fresh and bright. If any man has expectations greater than I have,
   I should like to see him. We have the greatest of expectations. Have
   you never felt like Mercy in her dream, when she laughed and when
   Christiana asked her what made her laugh, she said that she had had a
   vision of things yet to be revealed?

   Select any fruit of the Spirit you choose, and I maintain that we are
   favourably circumstanced for producing it; we are planted upon a very
   fruitful hill. What a fruitful hill we are living in as regards labour
   for Christ! Each one of us may find work for the Master; there are
   capital opportunities around us. There never was an age in which a man,
   consecrated to God, might do so much as he can at this time. There is
   nothing to restrain the most ardent zeal. We live in such happy times
   that, if we plunge into a sea of work, we may swim, and none can hinder
   us. Then, too, our labour is made, by God's grace, to be so pleasant to
   us. No true servant of Christ is weary of the work, though he may be
   weary in the work: it is not the work that he ever wearies of, for he
   wishes that he could do ten times more. Then our Lord makes our work to
   be successful. We bring one soul to Jesus, and that one brings a
   hundred. Sometimes, when we are fishing for Jesus, there may be few
   fish, but, blessed be His name, most of them enter the net; and we have
   to live praising and blessing God for all the favour with which He
   regards our labour of love. I do think I am right in saying that, for
   the bearing of the fruit which Jesus loves best, our position is
   exceedingly favourable.

   III. And now, this afternoon, at this table, our position here is
   favourable even now to our producing immediately, and upon the spot,
   the richest, ripest, rarest fruit for our Well-beloved. Here, at the
   communion-table, we are at the centre of the truth, and at the
   well-head of consolation. Now we enter the holy of holies, and come to
   the most sacred meeting-place between our souls and God.

   Viewed from this table, the vineyard slopes to the south, for
   everything looks towards Christ, our Sun. This bread, this wine, all
   set our souls aslope towards Jesus Christ, and He shines full upon our
   hearts, and minds, and souls, to make us bring forth much fruit. Are we
   not planted on a very fruitful hill?

   As we think of His passion for our sake, we feel that a wall is set
   about us to the north, to keep back every sharp blast that might
   destroy the tender grapes. No wrath is dreaded now, for Jesus has borne
   it for us; behold the tokens of His all-sufficient sacrifice! No anger
   of the Lord shall come to our restful spirits, for the Lord saith, "I
   have sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee." Here,
   on this table, are the pledges of His love unspeakable, and these, like
   a high wall, keep out the rough winds. Surely, we are planted on a very
   fruitful hill.

   Moreover, the Well-beloved Himself is among us. He has not let us out
   to husbandmen, but He Himself doth undertake to care for us; and that
   He is here we are sure, for here is His flesh, and here is His blood.
   You see the outward tokens, may you feel the unseen reality; for we
   believe in His real presence, though not in the gross corporeal sense
   with which worldly spirits blind themselves. The King has come into His
   garden: let us entertain Him with our fruits. He who for this vineyard
   poured out a bloody sweat, is now surveying the vines; shall they not
   at this instant give forth a goodly smell? The presence of our Lord
   makes this assembly a very fruitful hill: where He sets His feet, all
   good things flourish.

   Around this table, we are in a place where others have fruited well.
   Our literature contains no words more precious than those which have
   been spoken at the time of communion. Perhaps you know and appreciate
   the discourses of Willison, delivered on sacramental occasions.
   Rutherford's communion sermons have a sacred unction upon them. The
   poems of George Herbert, I should think, were most of them inspired by
   the sight of Christ in this ordinance. Think of the canticles of holy
   Bernard, how they flame with devotion. Saints and martyrs have been
   nourished at this table of blessing. This hollowed ordinance, I am
   sure, is a spot where hopes grow bright, and hearts grow warm, resolves
   become firm, and lives become fruitful, and all the clusters of our
   soul's fruit ripen for the Lord.

   Blessed be God, we are where we have ourselves often grown. We have
   enjoyed our best times when celebrating this sacred Eucharist. God
   grant it may be so again! Let us, in calm meditation and inward
   thought, now produce from our hearts sweet fruits of love, and zeal,
   and hope, and patience; let us yield great clusters like those of
   Eshcol, all for Jesus, and for Jesus only. Even now, let us give
   ourselves up to meditation, gratitude, adoration, communion, rapture;
   and let us spend the rest of our lives in glorifying and magnifying the
   ever-blessed name of our Well-beloved whose vineyard we are.

   "While such a scene of sacred joys

   Our raptured eyes and souls employs,

   Here we could sit, and gaze away

   A long, an everlasting day.

   "Well, we shall quickly pass the night,

   To the fair coasts of perfect light;

   Then shall our joyful senses rove

   O'er the dear object of our love.

   "There shall we drink full draughts of bliss,

   And pluck new life from heavenly trees.

   Yet now and then, dear Lord, bestow

   A drop of heaven on worms below."

                        REDEEMED SOULS FREED FROM FEAR.

  A TALK WITH A FEW FRIENDS AT MENTONE. "Fear not: for I have redeemed
  thee."--Isaiah xliii. 1.

REDEEMED SOULS FREED FROM FEAR.

   I WAS lamenting this morning my unfitness for my work, and especially
   for the warfare to which I am called. A sense of heaviness came over
   me, but relief came very speedily, for which I thank the Lord. Indeed,
   I was greatly burdened, but the Lord succoured me. The first verse read
   at the Sabbath morning service exactly met my case. It is in Isaiah
   xliii. 1: "But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and
   He that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not." I said to myself, "I am what
   God created me, and I am what He formed me, and therefore I must, after
   all, be the right man for the place wherein He has put me." We may not
   blame our Creator, nor suspect that He has missed His mark in forming
   an instrument for His work. Thus new comfort comes to us. Not only do
   the operations of grace in the spiritual world yield us consolation,
   but we are even comforted by what the Lord has done in creation. We are
   told to cease from our fears; and we do so, since we perceive that it
   is the Lord that made us, and not we ourselves, and He will justify His
   own creating skill by accomplishing through us the purposes of His
   love. Pray, I beseech you, for me, the weakest of my Lord's servants,
   that I may be equal to the overwhelming task imposed upon me.

   The next sentence of the chapter is usually most comforting to my soul,
   although on this one occasion the first sentence was a specially
   reviving cordial to me. The verse goes on to say,--

   "Fear not: for I have redeemed thee."

   Let us think for a few minutes of the wonderful depth of consolation
   which lies in this fact. We have been redeemed by the Lord Himself, and
   this is a grand reason why we should never again be subject to fear.
   Oh, that the logic of this fact could be turned into practice, so that
   we henceforth rejoiced, or at least felt the peace of God!

   These words may be spoken, first of all, of those frequent occasions in
   which the Lord has redeemed His people out of trouble. Many a time and
   oft might our Lord say to each one of us, "I have redeemed thee." Out
   of six, yea, six thousand trials He has brought us forth by the right
   hand of His power. He has released us from our afflictions, and brought
   us forth into a wealthy place. In the remembrance of all these
   redemptions the Lord seems to say to us, "What I have done before, I
   will do again. I have redeemed thee, and I will still redeem thee. I
   have brought thee from under the hand of the oppressor; I have
   delivered thee from the tongue of the slanderer; I have borne thee up
   under the load of poverty, and sustained thee under the pains of
   sickness; and I am able still to do the same: wherefore, then, dost
   thou fear? Why shouldst thou be afraid, since already I have again and
   again redeemed thee? Take heart, and be confident; for even to old age
   and to death itself I will continue to be thy strong Redeemer."

   I suppose there would be a reference here to the great redemption out
   of Egypt. This word is addressed to the people of God under captivity
   in Babylon, and we know that the Lord referred to the Egyptian
   redemption; for He says in the third verse, "I gave Egypt for thy
   ransom." Egypt was a great country, and a rich country, for we read of
   "all the treasures of Egypt", but God gave them for His chosen: He
   would give all the nations of the earth for His Israel. This was a
   wonderful stay to the people of God: they constantly referred to Egypt
   and the Red Sea, and made their national song out of it. In all
   Israel's times of disaster, and calamity, and trial, they joyfully
   remembered that the Lord had redeemed them when they were a company of
   slaves, helpless and hopeless, under a tyrant who cast their firstborn
   children into the Nile, a tyrant whose power was so tremendous that all
   the armies of the world could not have wrought their deliverance from
   his iron hand. The very nod of Pharaoh seemed to the inhabitants of
   Egypt to be omnipotent; he was a builder of pyramids, a master of all
   the sciences of peace and the arts of war. What could the Israelites
   have done against him? Jehovah came to their relief in their dire
   extremity. His plagues followed each other in quick succession. The
   dread volleys of the Lord's artillery confounded His foes. At last He
   smote all the firstborn of Egypt, the chief of all their strength. Then
   was Egypt glad that Israel departed, and the Lord brought forth His
   people with silver and gold. All the chivalry of Egypt was overthrown
   and destroyed at the Red Sea, and the timbrels of the daughters of
   Israel sounded joyously upon its shores. This redemption out of Egypt
   is so remarkable that it is remembered even in heaven. The Old
   Testament song is woven into that of the New Covenant; for there they
   "sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb."
   The first redeemption was so wonderful a type and prophecy of the other
   that it is no alloy to the golden hymn of eternal glory, but readily
   melts into the same celestial chant. Other types may cease to be
   remembered, but this was so much a fact as well as a type that it shall
   be had in memory for ever and ever. Every Israelite ought to have had
   confidence in God after what He had done for the people in redeeming
   them out of Egypt. To every one of the seed of Jacob it was a grand
   argument to enforce the precept, "Fear not."

   But I take it that the chief reference of these words are to that
   redemption which has been wrought out for us by Him who loved us, and
   washed us from our sins by His own blood. Let us think of it for a
   minute or two before we break the bread and drink of the cup of
   communion.

   The remembrance of this transcendent redemption ought to comfort us in
   all times of perplexity. When we cannot see our way, or cannot make out
   what to do, we need not be at all troubled concerning it; for the Lord
   Jehovah can see a way out of every intricacy. There never was a problem
   so hard to solve as that which is answered in redemption. Herein was
   the tremendous difficulty--How can God be just, and yet the Saviour of
   sinners? How can He fulfil His threatenings, and yet forgive sin? If
   that problem been left to angels and men, they could never worked it
   out throughout eternity; but God has solved it through freely
   delivering up His own Son. In the glorious sacrifice of Jesus we see
   the justice of God magnified; for He laid sin on the blessed Lord, who
   had become one with His chosen. Jesus identified Himself with His
   people, and therefore their sin was laid upon Him, and the sword of the
   Lord awoke against Him. He was not taken arbitrarily to be a victim,
   but He was a voluntary Sufferer. His relationship amounted to covenant
   oneness with His people, and "it behoved Christ to suffer." Herein is a
   wisdom which must be more than equal to all minor perplexities. Hear
   this, then, O poor soul in suspense! The Lord says, "I have redeemed
   thee. I have already brought thee out of the labyrinth in which thou
   wast lost by sin, and therefore I will take thee out of the meshes of
   the net of temptation, and lead thee through the maze of trial; I will
   bring the blind by a way that they know not, and lead them in paths
   which they have not known. I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring
   up My people from the depths of the sea." Let us commit our way unto
   the Lord. Mine is a peculiarly difficult one, but I know that my
   Redeemer liveth, and He will lead me by a right way. He will be our
   Guide even unto death; and after death He will guide us through those
   tracks unknown of the mysterious region, and cause us to rest with Him
   for ever.

   So also, if at any time we are in great poverty, or in great straitness
   of means for the Lord's work, and we are, therefore, afraid that we
   shall never get our needs supplied, let us cast off such fears as we
   listen to the music of these words: "Fear not: for I have redeemed
   thee." God Himself looked down from heaven, and saw that there was no
   man who could give to Him a ransom for his brother, and each man on his
   own part was hopelessly bankrupt; and then, despite our spiritual
   beggary, He found the means of our redemption. What then? Let us hear
   the use which the Holy Spirit makes of this fact: "He that spared not
   His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him
   also freely give us all things?" We cannot have a want which the Lord
   will not supply. Since God has given us Jesus, He will give us, not
   some things, but "all things." Indeed, all things are ours in Christ
   Jesus. No necessity of his life can for a single moment be compared to
   that dread necessity which the Lord has already supplied. The infinite
   gift of God's own Son is a far greater one than all that can be
   included in the term "all things": wherefore, it is a grand argument to
   the poor and needy, "Fear not: for I have redeemed thee." Perplexity
   and poverty are thus effectually met.

   We are at times troubled by a sense of our personal insignificance. It
   seems too much to hope that God's infinite mind should enter into our
   mean affairs. Though David said, "I am poor and needy, yet the Lord
   thinketh upon me," we are not always quite prepared to say the same. We
   make our sorrows great under the vain idea that they are too small for
   the Lord to notice. I believe that our greatest miseries spring from
   those little worries which we hesitate to bring to our heavenly Father.
   Our gracious God puts an end to all such thoughts as these by saying
   "Fear not for I have redeemed thee." You are not of such small account
   as you suppose. The Lord would never be wasteful of His sacred
   expenditure.

   He bought you with a price, and therefore He sets great store by you.
   Listen to what the Lord says: "Since thou wast precious in My sight,
   thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give
   men for thee, and people for thy life." It is amazing that the Lord
   should think so much of us as to give Jesus for us. "What is man that
   Thou art mindful of him?" Yet God's mind is filled with thoughts of
   love towards man. Know ye not that His only-begotten Son entered this
   world, and became a man? The man Christ Jesus has a name at which every
   knee shall bow, and He is so dear to the Father that, for His sake, His
   chosen ones are accepted, and are made to enjoy the freest access to
   Him. We sing truly,--

   "So near, so very near to God,

   Nearer we cannot be,

   For in the person of His Son

   We are as near as He."

   And now the very hairs of our head are all numbered, and the least
   burden we may roll upon the Lord. Those cares which we ought not to
   have may well cease, for "He careth for us." He that redeemed us never
   forgets us: His wounds have graven us upon the palms of His hands, and
   written our names deep in His side. Jesus stoops to our level, for He
   stooped to bear the cross to redeem us. Do not, therefore, be again
   afraid because of your insignificance. "Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and
   speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is
   passed over from my God? Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard, that
   the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth,
   fainteth not, neither is weary? There is no searching of His
   understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no
   might He increaseth strength." The Lord's memory is toward the little
   in Israel. He carrieth the lambs in His bosom.

   We are liable to fret a little when we think of our changeableness. If
   you are at all like me, you are very far from being always alike; I am
   sometimes lifted up to the very heavens, and then I go down to the
   deeps; I am at one time bright with joy and confidence, and at another
   time dark as midnight with doubts and fears. Even Elijah, who was so
   brave, had his fainting fits. We are to be blamed for this, and yet the
   fact remains: our experience is as an April day, when shower and
   sunshine take their turns. Amid our mournful changes we rejoice to hear
   the Lord's own voice, saying, "Fear not: for I have redeemed thee."
   Everything is not changeful wave; there is rock somewhere. Redemption
   is a fact accomplished.

   "The Cross, it standeth fast. Hallelujah!"

   The price is paid, the ransom accepted. This is done, and can never be
   undone. Jesus says, "I have redeemed thee." Change of feeling within
   does not alter the fact that the believer has been bought with a price,
   and made the Lord's own by the precious blood of Jesus. The Lord God
   has already done so much for us that our salvation is sure in Christ
   Jesus. Will He begin to build, and fail to finish? Will He lay the
   foundation in the everlasting covenant? Will He dedicate the walls with
   the infinite sacrifice of the Lamb of God? Will He give up the choicest
   treasure He ever had, the chosen of God and precious, to be the
   corner-stone, and then not finish the work He has begun? It is
   impossible. If He has redeemed us, He has, in that act, given us the
   pledge of all things.

   See how the gifts of God are bound to this redemption. "I have redeemed
   thee. I have called thee." "For whom He did foreknow, He also did
   predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be
   the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom He did predestinate,
   them He also called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and
   whom He justified, them He also glorified." Here is a chain in which
   each link is joined to all the rest, so that it cannot be separated. If
   God had only gone so far as to make a promise, He would not have drawn
   back from it; if God had gone as far as to swear an oath by Himself, He
   would not have failed to keep it; but when He went beyond promise and
   oath, and in very deed the sacrifice was slain, and the covenant was
   ratified: why, then it would be blasphemous to imagine that He would
   afterwards disannul it, and turn from His solemn pledge. There is no
   going back on the part of God, and consequently His redemption will
   redeem, and in redeeming it will secure us all things. "Who shall
   separate us from the love of Christ?" With the blood-mark upon us we
   may well cease to fear. How can we perish? How can we be deserted in
   the hour of need? We have been bought with too great a price for our
   Redeemer to let us slip. Therefore, let us march on with confidence,
   hearing our Redeemer say to us, "When thou passest through the waters,
   I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow
   thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned;
   neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Concerning His redeemed, the
   Lord will say to the enemy, "Touch not Mine anointed, and do My
   prophets no harm." The stars in their courses fight for the ransomed of
   the Lord. If their eyes were opened, they would see the mountain full
   of horses of fire and chariots of fire round about them. Oh, how my
   weary heart prizes redeeming love! If it were not for this, I would lay
   me down, and die. Friends forsake me, foes surround me, I am filled
   with contempt, and tortured with the subtlety which I cannot baffle;
   but as the Lord of all brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that
   great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting covenant,
   so by the blood of His covenant doth He loose His prisoners, and
   sustain the hearts of those who tremble at His Word. "O my soul, thou
   hast trodden down strength," for the Lord hath said unto thee, "Fear
   not: for I have redeemed thee."

                    JESUS, THE GREAT OBJECT OF ASTONISHMENT.

  A COMMUNION ADDRESS AT MENTONE. "Behold, My Servant shall deal prudently, He
  shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. As many were astonied at
  Thee; His visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the
  sons of men; so shall He sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their
  mouths at Him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that
  which they had not heard shall they consider."--Isaiah lii. 13-15.

JESUS, THE GREAT OBJECT ASTONISHMENT.

   OUR Lord Jesus Christ bore from of old the name of "Wonderful", and the
   word seems all too poor to set forth His marvellous person and
   character. He says of Himself, in the language of the
   prophet,--"Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given Me are
   for signs and for wonders." He is a fountain of astonishment to all who
   know Him, and the more they know of Him, the more are they "astonied"
   at Him. It is an astonishing thing that there should have been a Christ
   at all: the Incarnation is the miracle of miracles; that He who is the
   Infinite should become an infant, that He who made the worlds should be
   wrapt in swaddling-bands, remains a fact out of which, as from a hive,
   new wonders continually fly forth. In His complex nature He is so
   mysterious, and yet so manifest, that doubtless all the angels of
   heaven were and are astonished at Him. O Son of God, and Son of man,
   when Thou, the Word, wast made flesh, and dwelt among us, and Thy
   saints beheld Thy glory, it was but natural that many should be
   astonished at Thee!

   Our text seems to say that our Lord was, first, a great wonder in His
   griefs; and, secondly, that He was a great wonder in His glory.

   I. He was a great wonder in his griefs: "As many were astonied at Thee;
   His visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the
   sons of men."

   His visage was marred: no doubt His countenance bore the signs of a
   matchless grief. There were ploughings on His brow as well as upon His
   back; suffering, and brokenness of spirit, and agony of heart, had told
   upon that lovely face, till its beauty, though never to be destroyed,
   was "so" marred that never was any other so spoiled with sorrow. But it
   was not His face only, His whole form was marred more than the sons of
   men. The contour of His bodily manhood showed marks of singular
   assaults of sorrow, such as had never bowed another form so low. I do
   not know whether His gait was stooping, or whether His knees tottered,
   and His walk was feeble; but there was evidently a something about Him
   which gave Him the appearance of premature age, since to the Jews He
   looked older than He was, for when He was little more than thirty they
   said unto Him, "Thou art not yet fifty years old." I cannot conceive
   that He was deformed or ungainly; but despite His natural dignity, His
   worn and emaciated appearance marked Him out as "the Man of sorrows",
   and to the carnal eye His whole natural and spiritual form had in it
   nothing which evoked admiration; even as the prophet said, "When we
   shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him." The
   marring was not of that lovely face alone, but of the whole fabric of
   His wondrous manhood, so that many were astonied at Him.

   Our astonishment, when in contemplation we behold our suffering Lord,
   will arise from the consideration of what His natural beauty must have
   been, enshrined as He was from the first within a perfect body.
   Conceived without sin, and so born of a pure virgin without taint of
   hereditary sin, I doubt not that He was the flower and glow of manhood
   as to His form, and from His early youth He must have been a joy to His
   mother's eye. Great masters of the olden time expended all their skill
   upon the holy child Jesus, but it is not for the colours of earth to
   depict the Lord from heaven. That "holy thing" which was born of Mary
   was "seen of angels," and it charmed their eyes. Must such loveliness
   be marred? His every look was pure, His every thought was holy, and
   therefore the expression of His face must have been heavenly, and yet
   it must be marred. Poverty must mark it; hunger, and thirst, and
   weariness, must plough it; heart-griefs must seam and scar it; spittle
   must distain it; tears must scald it; smiting must bruise it; death
   must make it pale and bloodless. Well does Bernard sing--

   "O sacred Head, once wounded,

   With grief and pain weigh'd down,

   How scornfully surrounded

   With thorns, Thine only crown;

   How pale art Thou with anguish,

   With sore abuse and scorn!

   How does that visage languish,

   Which once was bright as morn!"

   The second astonishment to us must be that he could be so marred who
   had nothing in His character to mar His countenance. Sin is a sad
   disfigurement to faces which in early childhood were surpassingly
   attractive. Passion, if it be indulged in, soon sets a seal of
   deformity upon the countenance. Men that plunge into vice bear upon
   their features the traces of their hearts' volcanic fires. We most of
   us know some withered beings, whose beauty has been burned up by the
   fierce fires of excess, till they are a horror to look upon, as if the
   mark of Cain were set upon them. Every sin makes its line on a fair
   face. But there was no sin in the blessed Jesus, no evil thought to mar
   His natural perfectness. No redness of eyes ever came to Him by
   tarrying long at the wine; no unhallowed anger ever flushed His cheek;
   no covetousness gave to His eye a wolfish glance; no selfish care lent
   to His features a sharp and anxious cast. Such an unselfish, holy life
   as His ought to have rendered Him, if it had been possible, more
   beautiful every day. Indulging such benevolence, abiding in such
   communion with God, surely the face of Christ must, in the natural
   order of things, have more and more astonished all sympathetic
   observers with its transcendent charms. But sorrow came to engrave her
   name where sin had never made a stroke, and she did her work so
   effectually that His visage was more marred than that of any man,
   although the God of mercy knows there have been other visages that have
   been worn with pain and anguish past all recognition. I need not repeat
   even one of the many stories of human woe: that of our Lord surpasses
   all.

   Remember that the face of our Well-beloved, as well as all His form,
   must have been an accurate index of His soul. Physiognomy is a science
   with much truth in it when it deals with men of truth. Men weaned from
   simplicity know how to control their countenances; the crafty will
   appear to be honest, the hardened will seem to sympathize with the
   distressed, the revengeful will mimic good-will. There are some who
   continually use their countenance as they do their speech, to conceal
   their feelings; and it is almost a point of politeness with them never
   to show themselves, but always to go masked among their fellows.

   But the Christ had learned no such arts. He was so sincere, so
   transparent, so child-like and true, that whatever stirred within Him
   was apparent to those about Him, so far as they were capable of
   understanding His great soul. We read of Him that He was "moved with
   compassion." The Greek word means that He experienced a wonderful
   emotion of His whole nature, He was thrilled with it, and His disciples
   saw how deeply He felt for the people, who were as sheep without a
   shepherd. Though He did not commit Himself to men, He did not conceal
   Himself, but wore His heart upon His sleeve, and all could see what He
   was, and knew that He was full of grace and truth. We are, therefore,
   not surprised, when we devoutly consider our Lord's character, that His
   visage and form should indicate the inward agonies of His tender
   spirit; it could not be that His face should be untrue to His heart.
   The ploughers made deep furrows upon His soul as well as upon His back,
   and His heart was rent with inward convulsions, which could not but
   affect His whole appearance. Those eyes saw what those around Him could
   not see; those shoulders bore a constant burden which others could not
   know; and, therefore, His countenance and form betrayed the fact. O
   dear, dear Saviour, when we think of Thee, and of Thy majesty and
   purity, we are again astonished that woes should come upon Thee so
   grievously as to mar Thy visage and Thy form!

   Now think, dear friends, what were the causes of this marring. It was
   not old age that had wrinkled His brow, for He was still in the prime
   of life, neither was it a personal sickness which had caused decay;
   much less was it any congenital weakness and disease, which at length
   betrayed itself, for in His flesh there was no possibility of impurity,
   which would, in death, have led to corruption. It was occasioned,
   first, by His constant sympathy with the suffering. There was a heavy
   wear and tear occasioned by the extraordinary compassion of His soul.
   In three years it had told upon Him most manifestly, till His visage
   was marred more than that of any other man. To Him there was a kind of
   sucking up into Himself of all the suffering of those whom He blessed.
   He always bore upon Him the burden of mortal woe. We read of Christ
   healing all that were sick, "that it might be fulfilled which was
   spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and
   bare our sicknesses." Yes, He took those infirmities and sicknesses in
   some mystical way to Himself, just as I have heard of certain trees,
   which scatter health, because they themselves imbibe the miasma, and
   draw up into themselves those noxious vapours which otherwise would
   poison mankind. Thus, without being themselves polluted, they disinfect
   the atmosphere around them. This, our Saviour did, but the cost was
   great to Him. You can imagine, living as He did in the midst of one
   vast hospital, how constantly He must have seen sights that grieved and
   pained Him. Moreover, with a nature so pure and loving, He must have
   been daily tortured with the sin, and hypocrisy, and oppression which
   so abounded in His day. In a certain sense, He was always laying down
   His life for men, for He was spent in their service, tortured by their
   sin, and oppressed with their sorrow. The more we look into that marred
   visage, the more shall we be astonished at the anguish which it
   indicated.

   Do not wonder that He was more marred than any man, for He was more
   sensitive than other men. No part of Him was callous, He had no seared
   conscience, no blunted sensibility, no drugged and deadened nerve. His
   manhood was in its glory, in the perfection in which Adam was when God
   made him in His own image, and therefore He was ill-housed in such a
   fallen world. We read of Christ that He was "grieved for the hardness
   of their hearts," "He marvelled because of their unbelief," "He sighed
   deeply in His spirit," "He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled."
   This, however, was only the beginning of the marring.

   His deepest griefs and most grievous marring came of His
   substitutionary work, while bearing the penalty of our sin. One word
   recalls much of His woe: it is, "Gethsemane." Betrayed by Judas, His
   trusted friend, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "He that eateth
   bread with Me hath lifted up his heel against Me;" deserted even by
   John, for all the disciples forsook Him and fled; not one of all the
   loved ones with Him: He was left alone. He had washed their feet, but
   they could not watch with Him one hour; and in that garden He wrestled
   with our deadly foe, till His sweat was as it were great drops of blood
   falling down to the ground, and as Hart puts it, He--

   "Bore all Incarnate God could bear,

   With strength enough, but none to spare."

   I do verily believe that verse to be true. Herein you see what marred
   His countenance, and His form, even while in life. The whole of His
   manhood felt that dreadful shock, when He and the prince of darkness,
   in awful duel, fought it out amidst the gloom of the olives on that
   cold midnight when our redemption began to be fully accomplished.

   The whole of His passion marred His countenance and His form with its
   unknown sufferings. I restrain myself, lest this meditation should grow
   too painful. They bound Him, they scourged Him, they mocked Him, they
   plucked off the hair from His face, they spat upon Him, and at last
   they nailed Him to the tree, and there He hung. His physical pain alone
   must have been very great, but all the while there was within His soul
   an inward torment which added immeasurably to His sufferings. His God
   forsook Him. "Eloi, Eloi, lama, sabachthani?" is a voice enough to rend
   the rocks, and assuredly it makes us all astonished when, in the
   returning light, we look upon His visage, and are sure that never face
   of any man was so marred before, and never form of any son of man so
   grievously disfigured. Weeping and wondering, astonied and adoring, we
   leave the griefs of our own dear Lord, and with loving interest turn to
   the brighter portion of His unrivalled story.

   "Behold your King! Though the moonlight steals

   Through the silvery sprays of the olive tree,

   No star-gemmed sceptre or crown it reveals,

   In the solemn shade of Gethsemane.

   Only a form of prostrate grief,

   Fallen, crushed, like a broken leaf!

   Oh, think of His sorrow, that we may know

   The depth of love in the depth of woe!

   "Behold your King, with His sorrow crowned,

   Alone, alone in the valley is He!

   The shadows of death are gathering round,

   And the cross must follow Gethsemane.

   Darker and darker the gloom must fall,

   Filled is the cup, He must drink it all!

   Oh, think of His sorrow, that we may know

   His wondrous love in His wondrous woe!"

   II. There is an equal astonishment at His glories. I doubt not, if we
   could see Him now, as He appeared to John in Patmos, we should feel
   that we must do exactly as the beloved disciple did, for He
   deliberately wrote, "When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead." His
   astonishment was so great that he could not endure the sight. He had
   doubtless longed often to behold that glorified face and form, but the
   privilege was too much for him. While we are encumbered with these
   frail bodies, it is not fit for us to behold our Lord, for we should
   die with excess of delight if we were suddenly to behold that vision of
   splendour. Oh, for those glorious days when we shall lie for ever at
   His feet, and see our exalted Lord!

   "Behold, My servant shall deal prudently, He shall be exalted and
   extolled, and be very high." Observe the three words, "exalted and
   extolled, and be very high;" language pants for expression. Our Lord is
   now exalted in being lifted up from the grave, lifted up above all
   angels, and principalities, and powers. The Man Christ Jesus is the
   nearest to the eternal throne, ay, the Lamb is before the throne. "And
   I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts,
   and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain." He
   is in His own state and person exalted, and then by the praise rendered
   Him he is extolled, for he is worshipped and adored by the whole
   universe. All praise goes up before Him now, so that men extol Him,
   while "God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name, which is
   above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
   things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and
   that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
   glory of God the Father." Deep were His sorrows, but as high are His
   joys. It is said that, around many of the lochs in Scotland, the
   mountains are as high as the water is deep; and so our Lord's glories
   are as immeasurable as were His woes. What a meditation is furnished by
   these two-fold and incalculable heights and depths! Our text says that
   He shall "be very high." It cannot tell us how high. It is
   inconceivable how great and glorious in all respects the Lord Jesus
   Christ is at this moment. Oh, that He may be very high in our esteem!
   He is not yet exalted and extolled in any of our hearts as He deserves
   to be. I would we loved Him a thousand times as much as we do, but our
   whole heart goeth after Him, does it not? Would we not die for Him?
   Would we not set Him on a throne as high as seven heavens, and then
   think that we had not done enough for Him, who is now our all in all,
   and more than all?

   You notice what is said, concerning the Christ, as the most astonishing
   thing of all: "So shall He sprinkle many nations." Now is it the glory
   of our risen Lord, at this moment, that His precious blood is to save
   many nations. Before the throne, men of all nations shall sing, "Thou
   wast slain, and hast redeemed us unto God by Thy blood." Not the
   English nation alone shall be purified by His atoning blood, but many
   nations shall He sprinkle with His reconciling blood, even as Israel of
   old was sprinkled with the blood of sacrifice. We read in the tenth
   chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, at the twenty-second verse, of
   "having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience," and this is
   effected by that precious blood by which we have been once purged so
   effectually that we have no more consciousness of sins, but enter into
   perfect peace. The blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
   heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctified to the purifying of the
   flesh, and much more doth the blood of Christ purge our conscience from
   dead works, to serve the living God.

   The sprinkling of the blood was meant also to confirm the covenant:
   thus Moses "sprinkled both the book and all the people, saying, This is
   the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you." Our Lord
   Himself said, "This is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for
   many for the remission of sins." But is it not a wonderful thing that
   He should die as a malefactor on the tree, amid scorn and ridicule, and
   yet that He is this day bringing nations into covenant with God? Once
   so despised, and now: so mighty! God has given Him "for a covenant of
   the people, for a light of the Gentiles." Many nations shall by Him be
   joined in covenant with the God of the whole earth. Do not fall into
   the erroneous idea that this world is like a great ship-wrecked vessel,
   soon to go to pieces on an iron-bound coast; but rather let us expect
   the conversion of the world to the Lord Jesus. As a reward for the
   travail of His soul, He shall cause many nations to "exult with joy",
   for so some read the passage; the peoples of the earth shall not only
   be astonished at His griefs, but they shall admire His glories, adore
   His perfections, and be filled with an amazement of joy at His coming
   and kingdom. I can conceive nothing in the future too great and
   glorious to result from the passion and death of our Divine Lord.

   Listen to this, "Kings shall shut their mouths at Him." They shall see
   such a King as they themselves have never been; they speak freely to
   their brother-kings, but they shall not dare to speak to Him, and as
   for speaking against Him, that will be altogether out of the question.

   "Kings shall fall down before Him,

   And gold and incense bring."

   "For that which had not been told them shall they see." Kings are often
   out of the reach of the gospel, they do not hear it, it is not told to
   them. They would despise the lowly preacher, and little gatherings of
   believers meeting together for worship; they would only listen to
   stately discourses, which do not touch the heart and conscience. The
   great ones of the earth are usually the least likely to know the things
   of God, for while the poor have the gospel preached unto them, princes
   are more likely to hear soft flatteries and fair speeches. The time
   shall come, however, when Caesar shall bow before a real Imperator, and
   monarchs shall behold the Prince of the kings of the earth. "For the
   Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
   the archangel, and with the trump of God." They shall see His majesty,
   of which they had not even been told.

   "That which they had not heard shall they consider." They shall be
   obliged, even on their thrones, to think about the kingdom of the King
   of kings, and they shall retire to their closets to confess their sins,
   and to put on sackcloth and ashes, and to give heed to the words of
   wisdom. "Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges
   of the earth." To-day, the humble listen to Christ, but by-and-by the
   mightiest of the mighty shall turn all their thoughts towards Him. He
   shall gather sheaves of sceptres beneath His arm, and crowns shall be
   strewn at His feet; and "He shall reign for ever and ever," and "of the
   increase of His government and peace there shall be no end." If we were
   astonished at the marring of His face, we shall be much more astonished
   at the magnificence of His glory. Upon His throne none shall question
   His supremacy, none shall doubt His loveliness; but His enemies shall
   weep and wail because of Him whom they pierced; while He shall be
   admired in all them that believe. Adorable Lord, we long for Thy
   glorious appearing! We beseech Thee tarry not!

   "Come, and begin Thy reign

   Of everlasting peace;

   Come, take the kingdom to Thyself,

   Great King of Righteousness!"

BANDS OF LOVE; OR, UNION TO CHRIST. "I drew them with cords of a man, with bands
 of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
                      laid meat unto them."--Hosea xi. 4.

BANDS OF LOVE; OR, UNION TO CHRIST.

   SYSTEMATIC theologians have usually regarded union to Christ under
   three aspects, natural, mystical and federal, and it may be that these
   three terms are comprehensive enough to embrace the whole subject, but
   as our aim is simplicity, let us be pardoned if we appear diffuse when
   we follow a less concise method.

   1. The saints were from the beginning joined to Christ by bands of
   everlasting love. Before He took on Him their nature, or brought them
   into a conscious enjoyment of Himself, His heart was set upon their
   persons, and His soul delighted in them. Long ere the worlds were made,
   His prescient eye beheld His chosen, and viewed them with delight.
   Strong were the indissoluble bands of love which then united Jesus to
   the souls whom He determined to redeem. Not bars of brass, or triple
   steel, could have been more real and effectual bonds. True love, of all
   things in the universe, has the greatest cementing force, and will bear
   the greatest strain, and endure the heaviest pressure: who shall tell
   what trials the Saviour's love has borne; and how well it has sustained
   them? Never union was more true than this. As the soul of Jonathan was
   knit to the soul of David so that he loved David as his own soul, so
   was our glorious Lord united and joined to us by the ties of fervent,
   faithful love. Love has a most potent power in effecting and sustaining
   union, but never does it display its force so well as when we see it
   bringing the Creator into oneness with the creature, the divine into
   alliance with the human. This, then, is to be regarded as the
   day-spring of union--the love of Christ embracing in its folds the
   whole of the elected family.

   2. There is, moreover, a union of purpose as well as of love. By the
   first, we have seen that the elect are made one with Jesus by the act
   and will of the Son; by the second, they are joined to Him by the
   ordination and decree of the Father. These divine acts are co-eternal.
   The Son loved and chose His people to be His own bride, the Father made
   the same choice, and decreed the chosen ones for ever one with His
   all-glorious Son. The Son loved them, and the Father decreed them His
   portion and inheritance; the Father ordained them to be what the Son
   Himself did make them.

   In God's purpose they have been eternally associated as parts of one
   design. Salvation was the fore-ordained scheme whereby God would
   magnify Himself, and a Saviour was in that scheme from necessity
   associated with the persons chosen to be saved. The scope of the
   dispensation of grace included both; the circle of wisdom comprehended
   Redeemer and redeemed in its one circumference. They could not be
   dissociated in the mind and will of the all-planning Jehovah.

   "Christ be My first elect,' He said,

   Then chose our souls in Christ, our Head."

   The same Book which contains the names of the heirs of life contains
   the name of their Redeemer. He could not be a Redeemer unless souls had
   been given Him to redeem, nor could they have been called the ransomed
   of the Lord, if He had not engaged to purchase them. Redemption, when
   determined upon by the God of heaven, included in it both Christ and
   His people; and hence, in the decree which fixed it, they were brought
   into a near and intimate alliance.

   The foresight of the Fall led the divine mind to provide for the
   catastrophe in which the elect would have perished, had not their ruin
   been prevented by gracious interposition. Hence followed as part of the
   divine arrangement other forms of union, which, besides their immediate
   object in salvation, had doubtless a further design of illustrating the
   condescending alliance which Jesus had formed with His chosen. The next
   and following points are of this character.

   3. Jesus is one with His elect federally. As every heir of flesh and
   blood has a personal interest in Adam, because he is the covenant head
   and representative of the race as considered under the law of works;
   so, under the law of grace, every redeemed soul is one with the Lord
   from heaven, since He is the Second Adam, the Sponsor and Substitute of
   the elect in the new covenant of love. The apostle Paul declares that
   Levi was in the loins of Abraham when Melchizedek met him: it is
   equally true that the believer was in the loins of Jesus Christ, the
   Mediator, when in old eternity the covenant settlements of grace were
   decreed, ratified, and made sure for ever. Thus, whatever Christ hath
   done, He hath wrought for the whole body of His Church. We were
   crucified in Him, and buried with Him (read Col. ii. 10-13), and to
   make it still more wonderful, we are risen with Him, and have even
   ascended with Him to the seats on high (Eph. ii. 6). It is thus that
   the Church has fulfilled the law, and is "accepted in the Beloved." It
   is thus that she is regarded with complacency by the just Jehovah, for
   He views her in Jesus, and does not look upon her as separate from her
   covenant Head. As the anointed Redeemer of Israel, Christ Jesus has
   nothing distinct from His Church, but all that He has He holds for her.
   Adam's righteousness was ours as long as he maintained it, and his sin
   was ours the moment that he committed it; and, in the same manner, all
   that the Second Adam is, or does, is ours as well as His, seeing that
   He is our Representative. Here is the foundation of the covenant of
   grace. This gracious system of representation and substitution, which
   moved Justin Martyr to cry out, "O blessed change! O sweet
   permutation!" this, I say, is the very groundwork of the gospel of our
   salvation, and is to be received with strong faith and rapturous joy.
   In every place the saints are perfectly one with Jesus.

   "One in the tomb, one when He rose,

   One when He triumph'd o'er His foes,

   One when in heaven He took His seat,

   While seraphs sang all hell's defeat.

   "This sacred tie forbids their fears,

   For all He is or has is theirs;

   With Him, their Head, they stand or fall,

   Their life, their Surety, and their all."

   4. For the accomplishment of the great works of atonement and perfect
   obedience, it was needful that the Lord Jesus should take upon Him "the
   likeness of sinful flesh." Thus, He became one with us in our nature,
   for in Holy Scripture all partakers of flesh and blood are regarded as
   of one family. By the fact of common descent from Adam, all men are of
   one race, seeing that "God hath made of one blood all nations that
   dwell upon the face of the earth." Hence, in the Bible, man is spoken
   of universally as "thy brother" (Lev. xix. 17; Job xxii. 6; Matt. v.
   23, 24; Luke xvii. 3; Rom. xiv. 10, &c., &c.); and "thy neighbour"
   (Exod. xx. 16; Lev. xix. 13-18; Matt. v. 43; Rom. xiii. 9; James ii.
   8); to whom, on account of nature and descent, we are required to
   render kindness and goodwill. Now, although our great Melchizedek in
   His divinity is without father, without mother, without descent, having
   neither beginning of days nor end of life, and is both in essence and
   rank at an infinite remove from fallen manhood; yet as to His manhood
   He is to be reckoned as one of ourselves. He was born of a woman, He
   hung upon her breasts, and was dandled upon her knee; He grew from
   infancy to youth and thence to manhood, and in every stage He was a
   true and real partaker of our humanity. He is as certainly of the race
   of Adam as He is divine. He is God without fiction or metaphor, and He
   is man beyond doubt or dispute. The Godhead was not humanized, and so
   diluted; and the manhood was not transformed into divinity, and so
   rendered more than human. Never was any man more a portion of His kind
   than was the Son of man, the Man of sorrows and the Acquaintance of
   grief. He is man's Brother, for He bore the whole nature of man. "The
   Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." He who was very God of very
   God made Himself a little lower than the angels, and took upon Him the
   form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.

   This was done with the most excellent design with regard to our
   redemption, inasmuch as it was necessary that, as man had sinned, man
   should suffer; but doubtless it had a further motive, the honouring of
   the Church, and the enabling of her Lord to sympathize with her. The
   apostle most sweetly remarks, "Forasmuch then as the children are
   partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the
   same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death
   were all their lifetime subject to bondage" (Heb. ii. 14, 15); and
   again, "For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
   feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we
   are, yet without sin" (Heb. iv. 15). Thus, in ties of blood, Jesus, the
   Son of man, is one with all the heirs of heaven: "For which cause He is
   not ashamed to call them brethren" (Heb. ii. 11). What reason we have
   here for the strongest consolation and delight, seeing that, "Both He
   that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one." We can
   say of our Lord as poor Naomi said of bounteous Boaz, "The man is near
   of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen." Overwhelmed by the liberality
   of our blessed Lord, we are often led to cry with Ruth, "Why have I
   found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me,
   seeing I am a stranger?" and are we not ready to die with wonder when,
   in answer to such a question, He tells us that He is our Brother, bone
   of our bone, and flesh of our flesh?

   If, in all our straits and distresses, we would always treasure in our
   minds the remembrance of our Redeemer's manhood, we should never bemoan
   the absence of a sympathizing heart, since we should always have His
   abundant compassion for our consolation. He is no stranger, He is able
   to enter into the heart's bitterness, for He has Himself tasted the
   wormwood and the gall. Let us never doubt His power to sympathize with
   us in our infirmities and sorrows.

   There is one aspect of this subject of our natural union to Christ
   which it were improper to pass over in silence, for it is very precious
   to the believer. While the Lord Jesus takes upon Himself our nature (2
   Peter i. 4), He restores in us that image of God (Gen. i. 27) which was
   blotted and defaced by the fall of Adam. He raises us from the
   degradation of sin to the dignity of perfection. So that, in a two-fold
   sense, the Head and members are of one nature, and not like that
   monstrous image which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream. The head was of
   fine gold, but the belly and the thighs were of brass, the legs of
   iron, and the feet, part of iron and part of clay. Christ's mystical
   body is no absurd combination of opposites; the Head is immortal, and
   the body is immortal, too, for thus the record stands, "Because I live,
   ye shall live also." "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are
   heavenly." "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
   bear the image of the heavenly:" and this shall in a few more years be
   more fully manifest to us, for "this corruptible must put on
   incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality." Such as is the
   Head, such is the body, and every member in particular;--a chosen Head,
   and chosen members; an accepted Head, and accepted members; a living
   Head, and living members. If the Head be of pure gold, all the parts of
   the body are of pure gold also. Thus is there a double union of nature
   as a basis for the closest communion.

   Pause here, and see if thou canst, without ecstatic amazement,
   contemplate the infinite condescension of the Son of God in exalting
   thy wretchedness into blessed union with His glory. Thou art so mean
   that, in remembrance of thy mortality, thou mayest say to corruption,
   "Thou art my father," and to the worm, "Thou art my sister;" and yet,
   in Christ, thou art so honoured that thou canst say to the Almighty,
   "Abba, Father," and to the Incarnate God, "Thou art my Brother and my
   Husband." Surely, if relationships to ancient and noble families make
   men think highly of themselves, we have whereof to glory over the heads
   of them all. Lay hold upon this privilege; let not a senseless
   indolence make thee negligent to trace this pedigree, and suffer no
   foolish attachment to present vanities to occupy thy thoughts to the
   exclusion of this glorious privilege, this heavenly honour of union
   with Christ.

   We must now retrace our steps to the ancient mountains, and contemplate
   this union in one of its earliest forms.

   5. Christ Jesus is also joined unto His people in a mystical union.
   Borrowing once more from the story of Ruth, we remark that Boaz,
   although one with Ruth by kinship, did not rest until he had entered
   into a nearer union still, namely, that of marriage; and in the same
   manner there is, superadded to the natural union of Christ with His
   people, a mystical union by which He assumes the position of Husband,
   while the Church is owned as His bride. In love He espoused her to
   Himself, as a chaste virgin, long before she fell under the yoke of
   bondage. Full of burning affection, He toiled like Jacob for Rachel,
   until the whole of her purchase-money had been paid, and now, having
   sought her by His Spirit, and brought her to know and love Him, He
   awaits the glorious hour when their mutual bliss shall be consummated
   at the marriage-supper of the Lamb. Not yet hath the glorious
   Bridegroom presented His betrothed, perfected and complete, before the
   Majesty of heaven; not yet hath she actually entered upon the enjoyment
   of her dignities as His wife and queen; she is as yet a wanderer in a
   world of woe, a dweller in the tents of Kedar; but she is even now the
   bride, the spouse of Jesus, dear to His heart, precious in His sight,
   and united with His person. In love and tenderness, He says to her,--

   "Forget thee I will not, I cannot, thy name

   Engraved on My heart doth for ever remain:

   The palms of My hands whilst I look on I see

   The wounds I received when suffering for thee."

   He exercises towards her all the affectionate offices of Husband. He
   makes rich provision for her wants, pays all her debts, allows her to
   assume His name, and to share in all His wealth. Nor will He ever act
   otherwise to her. The word divorce He will never mention, for "He
   hateth putting away." Death must sever the conjugal tie between the
   most loving mortals, but it cannot divide the links of this immortal
   marriage. In heaven they marry not, but are as the angels of God; yet
   is there this one marvellous exception to the rule, for in heaven
   Christ and His Church shall celebrate their joyous nuptials. And this
   affinity, as it is more lasting, so is it more near than earthly
   wedlock. Let the love of husband be never so pure and fervent, it is
   but a faint picture of the flame that burns in the heart of Jesus.
   Passing all human union is that mystical cleaving unto the Church, for
   which Christ did leave His Father, and become one flesh with her.

   If this be the union which subsists between our souls and the person of
   our Lord, how deep and broad is the channel of our communion! This is
   no narrow pipe through which a thread-like stream may wind its way, it
   is a channel of amazing depth and breadth, along whose breadth and
   length a ponderous volume of living water may roll its strength.
   Behold, He hath set before us an open door; let us not be slow to
   enter. This city of communion hath many pearly gates, every several
   gate is of one pearl, and each gate is thrown open to the uttermost
   that we may enter, assured of welcome. If there were but one small
   loophole through which to talk with Jesus, it would be a high privilege
   to thrust a word of fellowship through the narrow door; how much we are
   blessed in having so large an entrance! Had the Lord Jesus been far
   away from us, with many a stormy sea between, we should have longed to
   send a messenger to Him to carry Him our love, and bring us tidings
   from His Father's house; but see His kindness, He has built His house
   next door to ours, nay, more, He takes lodgings with us, and
   tabernacles in poor humble hearts, that so He may have perpetual
   intercourse with us. Oh, how foolish must we be, if we do not live in
   habitual communion with Him! When the road is long, and dangerous, and
   difficult, we need not wonder that friends seldom meet each other; but
   when they live together, shall Jonathan forget his David? A wife may,
   when her husband is upon a journey, abide many days without holding
   converse with him; but she could never endure to be separated from him
   if she knew him to be in one of the chambers of their own house. Seek
   thy Lord, for He is near; embrace Him, for He is thy Brother; hold Him
   fast, for He is thine Husband; press Him to thine heart, for He is of
   thine own flesh.

   6. As yet we have only considered the acts of Christ for us, whereby He
   effects and proves His union to us; we must now come to more personal
   and sensible forms of this great truth.

   Those who are set apart for the Lord are in due time severed from the
   impure mass of fallen humanity, and are by sovereign grace engrafted
   into the person of the Lord Jesus. This, which we call vital union, is
   rather a matter of experience than of doctrine; it must be learned in
   the heart, and not by the head. Like every other work of the Spirit,
   the actual implantation of the soul into Christ Jesus is a mysterious
   and secret operation, and is no more to be understood by carnal reason
   than is the new birth of which it is an attendant. Nevertheless, the
   spiritual man discerns it as a most essential thing in the salvation of
   the soul, and he clearly sees how a living union to Christ is the sure
   consequence of the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit, and is
   indeed, in some respects, identical with it.

   When the Lord in mercy passed by and saw us in our blood, He first of
   all said, "Live"; and this He did first, because, without life, there
   can be no spiritual knowledge, feeling, or motion. Life is one of the
   absolutely essential things in spiritual matters; and until it be
   bestowed, we are incapable of partaking in the things of the kingdom.
   Now, the life which grace confers upon the saints at the moment of
   their quickening is none other than the life of Christ, which, like the
   sap from the stem, runs into us, the branches, and establishes a living
   connection between our souls and Jesus. Faith is the grace which
   perceives this union, and proceeds from it as its firstfruit. It is, to
   use a metaphor from the Canticles, the neck which joins the body of the
   Church to its all-glorious Head.

   "O Faith! thou bond of union with the Lord,

   Is not this office thine? and thy fit name,

   In the economy of gospel types,

   And symbols apposite--the Church's neck;

   Identifying her in will and work

   With Him ascended?"

   Faith lays hold upon the Lord Jesus with a firm and determined grasp.
   She knows His excellence and worth, and no temptation can induce her to
   repose her trust elsewhere; and Christ Jesus is so delighted with this
   heavenly grace, that He never ceases to strengthen and sustain her by
   the loving embrace and all-sufficient support of His eternal arms.
   Here, then, is established a living, sensible, and delightful union,
   which casts forth streams of love, confidence, sympathy, complacency,
   and joy, whereof both the bride and Bridegroom love to drink. When the
   eye is clear, and the soul can evidently perceive this oneness between
   itself and Christ, the pulse may be felt as beating for both, and the
   one blood may be known as flowing through the veins of each. Then is
   the heart made exceedingly glad, it is as near heaven as it ever can be
   on earth, and is prepared for the enjoyment of the most sublime and
   spiritual kind of fellowship. This union may be quite as true when we
   are troubled with doubts concerning it, but it cannot afford
   consolation to the soul unless it be indisputably proven and assuredly
   felt; then is it indeed a honeycomb dropping with sweetness, a precious
   jewel sparkling with light. Look well to this matter, ye saints of the
   Most High!

                            "I WILL GIVE YOU REST."

  A COMMUNION ADDRESS AT MENTONE. "I will give you rest."--Matthew xi. 28.

"I WILL GIVE YOU REST."

   WE have a thousand times considered these words as an encouragement to
   the labouring and the laden; and we may, therefore, have failed to read
   them as a promise to ourselves. But, beloved friends, we have come to
   Jesus, and therefore He stands engaged to fufil this priceless pledge
   to us. We may now enjoy the promise; for we have obeyed the precept.
   The faithful and true Witness, whose word is truth, promised us rest if
   we would come to Him; and, therefore, since we have come to Him, and
   are always coming to Him, we may boldly say, "O Thou, who art our
   Peace, make good Thy word to us wherein Thou hast said, I will give you
   rest.'"

   By faith, I see our Lord standing in our midst, and I hear Him say,
   with voice of sweetest music, first to all of us together, and then to
   each one individually, "I will give you rest." May the Holy Spirit
   bring to each of us the fulness of the rest and peace of God! For a few
   minutes only shall I need your attention; and we will begin by asking
   the question,--

   I. What must these words mean?

   A dear friend prayed this morning that, while studying the Scriptures,
   we might be enabled to read between the lines, and beneath the letter
   of the Word. May we have holy insight thus to read our Lord's most
   gracious language!

   This promise must mean rest to all parts of our spiritual nature. Our
   bodies cannot rest if the head is aching, or the feet are full of pain;
   if one member is disturbed, the whole frame is unable to rest; and so
   the higher nature is one, and such intimate sympathies bind together
   all its faculties and powers, that every one of them must rest, or none
   can be at ease, Jesus gives real, and, consequently, universal rest to
   every part of our spiritual being.

   The heart is by nature restless as old ocean's waves; it seeks an
   object for its affection; and when it finds one beneath the stars, it
   is doomed to sorrow. Either the beloved changes, and there is
   disappointment; or death comes in, and there is bereavement. The more
   tender the heart, the greater its unrest. Those in whom the heart is
   simply one of the largest valves are undisturbed, because they are
   callous; but the sensitive, the generous, the unselfish, are often
   found seeking rest and finding none. To such, the Lord Jesus says,
   "Come unto Me, and I will give you rest." Look hither, ye loving ones,
   for here is a refuge for your wounded love! You may delight yourselves
   in the Well-beloved, and never fear that He will fail or forget you.
   Love will not be wasted, however much it may be lavished upon Jesus. He
   deserves it all, and he requites it all. In loving Him, the heart finds
   a delicious content. When the head lies in His bosom, it enjoys an ease
   which no pillow of down could bestow. How Madame Guyon rested amid
   severe persecutions, because her great love to Jesus filled her soul to
   the brim! O aching heart, O breaking heart, come hither, for Jesus
   saith, "I will give you rest."

   The conscience, when it is at all alive and awake, is much disturbed
   because the holy law of God has been broken by sin. Now, conscience
   once aroused is not easily quieted. Neither unbelief nor superstition
   can avail to lull it to sleep; it defies these opiates of falsehood,
   and frets the soul with perpetual annoyance. Like the troubled sea, it
   cannot rest; but constantly casts up upon the shore of memory the mire
   and dirt of past transgressions and iniquities. Is this your case? Then
   Jesus says, "I will give you rest." If, at any time, fears and
   apprehensions arise from an awakened conscience, they can only be
   safely and surely quieted by our flying to the Crucified. In the
   blessed truth of a substitution, accepted of God, and fully made by the
   Lord Jesus, our mind finds peace. Justice is honoured, and law is
   vindicated, in the sacrifice of Christ. Since God is satisfied, I may
   well be so. Since the Father has raised Jesus from the dead, and set
   Him at His own right hand, there can be no question as to His
   acceptance; and, consequently, all who are in Him are accepted also. We
   are under no apprehension now as to our being condemned; Jesus gives us
   rest, by enabling us to utter the challenge, "Who is he that
   condemneth?" and to give the reassuring answer, "Christ hath died."

   The intellect is another source of unrest; and in these times it
   operates with special energy towards labour and travail of mind.
   Doubts, stinging like mosquitoes, are suggested by almost every page of
   the literature of the day. Most men are drifting, like vessels which
   have no anchors, and these come into collision with us. How can we
   rest? This scheme of philosophy eats up the other; this new fashion of
   heresy devours the last. Is there any foundation? Is anything true? Or
   is it all romance, and are we doomed to be the victims of an
   ever-changing lie? O soul, seek not a settlement by learning of men;
   but come and learn of Jesus, and thou shalt find rest! Believe Jesus,
   and let all the Rabbis contradict. The Son of God was made flesh, He
   lived, He died, He rose again, He lives, He loves; this is true, and
   all that He teaches in His Word is assured verity; the rest may blow
   away, like chaff before the wind. A mind in pursuit of truth is a dove
   without a proper resting-place for the sole of its foot, till it finds
   its rest in Jesus, the true Noah.

   Next, these words mean rest about all things. He who is uneasy about
   anything has not found rest. A thousand thorns and briars grow on the
   soil of this earth, and no man can happily tread life's ways unless his
   feet are shod with that preparation of the gospel of peace which Jesus
   gives. In Christ, we are at rest as to our duties; for He instructs and
   helps us in them. In Him, we are at rest about our trials; for He
   sympathizes with us in them. With His love, we are restful as to the
   movements of Providence; for His Father loves us, and will not suffer
   anything to harm us. Concerning the past, we rest in His forgiving
   love; as to the present, it is bright with His loving fellowship; as to
   the future, it is brilliant with His expected Advent. This is true of
   the little as well as of the great. He who saves us from the battle-axe
   of Satanic temptation, also extracts the thorn of a domestic trial. We
   may rest in Jesus as to our sick child, as to our business trouble, or
   as to grief of any kind. He is our Comforter in all things, our
   Sympathizer in every form of temptation. Have you such all-covering
   rest? If not, why not? Jesus gives it; why do you not partake of it?
   Have you something which you could not bring to Him? Then, fly from it;
   for it is no fit thing for a believer to possess. A disciple should
   know neither grief nor joy which he could not reveal to his Lord.

   This rest, we may conclude, must be a very wonderful one, since Jesus
   gives it. His hands give not by pennyworths and ounces; he gives golden
   gifts, in quantity immeasurable. It is Jesus who gives the peace of God
   which passeth all understanding. It is written, "Great peace have they
   which love Thy law;" what peace must they have who love God's Son!
   There are periods when Jesus gives us a heavenly Elysium of rest; we
   cannot describe the divine repose of our hearts at such times. We read,
   in the Gospels, that when Jesus hushed the storm, "there was a great
   calm," not simply "a calm", but a great calm, unusual, absolute,
   perfect, memorable. It reminds us of the stillness which John describes
   in the Revelation: "I saw four angels standing on the four corners of
   the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should
   not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree;" not a ripple
   stirred the waters, not a leaf moved on the trees.

   Assuredly, our Lord has given a blessed rest to those who trust Him,
   and follow Him. They are often unable to inform others as to their deep
   peace, and the reasons upon which it is founded; but they know it, and
   it brings them an inward wealth compared with which the fortune of an
   ungodly millionaire is poverty itself. May we all know to the full, by
   happy, personal experience, the meaning of our Saviour's promise, "I
   will give you rest"!

   II. But now, in the second: place, let us ask,--Why should we have this
   rest?

   The first answer is in our text. We should enjoy this rest because
   Jesus gives it. As He gives it, we ought to take it. Because He gives
   it, we may take it. I have known some Christians who have thought that
   it would be presumption on their part to take this rest; so they have
   kept fluttering about, like frightened birds, weary with their long
   flights, but not daring to fold their tired wings, and rest. If there
   is any presumption in the case, let us not be so presumptuous as to
   think that we know better than our Lord. He gives us rest: for that
   reason, if for no other, let us take it, promptly and gratefully. "Rest
   in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him." Say with David, "My heart is
   fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise."

   "Now rest, my long-divided heart,

   Fix'd on this blissful centre, rest."

   Next, we should take the rest that Jesus gives, because it will refresh
   us. We are often weary; sometimes we are weary in God's work, though I
   trust we are never weary of it. There are many things to cause us
   weariness: sin, sorrow, the worldliness of professors, the prevalence
   of error in the Church, and so on. Often, we are like a tired child,
   who can hold up his little head no longer. What does he do? Why, he
   just goes to sleep in his mother's arms! Let us be as wise as the
   little one; and let us rest in our loving Saviour's embrace. The poet
   speaks of--

   "Tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep;"

   and so it is. Sometimes, the very best thing a Christian man can do is,
   literally, to go to sleep. When he wakes, he will be so refreshed, that
   he will seem to be in a new world. But spiritually, there is no
   refreshing like that which comes from the rest which Christ gives. As
   Isaiah said, "This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to
   rest: and this is the refreshing." Dr. Bonar's sweet hymn, which is so
   suitable for a sinner coming to Christ for the first time, is just as
   appropriate for a weary saint returning to his Saviour's arms; for he,
   too, can sing,--

   "I heard the voice of Jesus say,

   Come unto Me, and rest;

   Lay down, thou weary one, lay down

   Thy head upon My breast.'

   I came to Jesus as I was,

   Weary, and worn, and sad:

   I found in Him a resting-place,

   And He has made me glad."

   Another reason why we should have this rest is, that it will enable us
   to concentrate all our faculties. Many, who might be strong servants of
   the Lord, are very weak, because their energies are not concentrated
   upon one object. They do not say with Paul, "This one thing I do." We
   are such poor creatures that we cannot occupy our minds with more than
   one subject, at a time. Why, even the buzzing of a fly, or the
   trumpeting of a mosquito, would be quite sufficient to take our
   thoughts away from our present holy service! As long as we have any
   burden resting on our shoulders, we cannot enjoy perfect rest; and as
   long as there is any burden on our conscience or heart, we cannot have
   rest of soul. How are we to be freed from these burdens? Only by
   yielding ourselves wholly to the Great Burden-Bearer, who says, "Come
   unto Me, and, I will give you rest." Possessing this rest, all our
   faculties will be centred and focussed upon one object, and with
   undivided hearts we shall seek God's glory.

   Having obtained this rest, we shall be able to testify for our Lord. I
   remember, when I first began to teach in a Sunday-school, that I was
   speaking one day to my class upon the words, "He that believeth on Me
   hath everlasting life." I was rather taken by surprise when one of the
   boys said to me, "Teacher, have you got everlasting life?" I replied,
   "I hope so." The scholar was not satisfied with my answer, so he asked
   another question, "But, teacher, don't you know?" The boy was right;
   there can be no true testimony except that which springs from assured
   conviction of our own safety and joy in the Lord. We speak that we do
   know; we believe, and therefore speak. Rest of heart, through coming to
   Christ, enables us to invite others to Him with great confidence, for
   we can tell them what heavenly peace He has given to us. This will
   enable us to put the gospel very attractively, for the evidence of our
   own experience will help others to trust the Lord for themselves. With
   the beloved apostle John, we shall be able to say to our hearers, "That
   which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen
   with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled,
   of the Word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it,
   and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with
   the Father, and was manifested unto us;) that which we have seen and
   heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us:
   and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus
   Christ."

   Once more, this rest is necessary to our growth. The lily in the garden
   is not taken up and transplanted two or three times a day; that would
   be the way to prevent all growth. But it is kept in one place, and
   tenderly nurtured. It is by keeping it quite still that the gardener
   helps it to attain to perfection. A child of God would grow much more
   rapidly if he would but rest in one place instead of being always on
   the move. "In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in
   confidence shall be your strength." Martha was cumbered about much
   serving; but Mary sat at Jesus' feet. It is not difficult to tell which
   of them would be the more likely to grow in the grace and knowledge of
   our Lord Jesus Christ.

   This is a tempting theme, but I must not linger over it, as we must
   come to the communion. I will give only one more answer to the
   question, "Why should we have this rest?" It will prepare us for
   heaven. I was reading a book, the other day, in which I met with this
   expression,--"The streets of heaven begin on earth." That is true;
   heaven is not so far away as some people think. Heaven is the place of
   perfect holiness, the place of sinless service, the place of eternal
   glory; and there is nothing that will prepare us for heaven like this
   rest that Jesus gives. Heaven must be in us before we are in heaven;
   and he who has this rest has heaven begun below. Enoch was virtually in
   heaven while he walked with God on the earth, and he had only to
   continue that holy walk to find himself actually in heaven. This world
   is part of our Lord's great house, of which heaven is the upper story.
   Some of us may hear the Master's call, "Come up higher," sooner than we
   think; and then, with we rest in Christ, there we shall rest with
   Christ, The more we have of this blessed rest now, the better shall we
   be prepared for the rest that remaineth to the people of God, that
   eternal "keeping of a Sabbath" in the Paradise above.

   III. I have left myself only a minute for the answers to my third
   question,--How can we obtain this rest?

   First, by coming to Christ. He says, "Come unto Me, . . . and I will
   give you rest." I trust that all in this little company have come to
   Christ by faith; now let us come to Him in blessed fellowship and
   communion at His table. Let us keep on coming to Him, as the apostle
   says, "to whom coming," continually coming, and never going away. When
   we wake in the morning, let us come to Christ in the act of renewed
   communion with Him; all the day long, let us keep on coming to Him even
   while we are occupied with the affairs of this life; and at night, let
   our last waking moments be spent in coming to Jesus. Let us come to
   Christ by searching the Scriptures, for we shall find Him there on
   almost every page. Let us come to Christ in our thoughts, desires,
   aspirations wishes; so shall the promise of the text be fulfilled to
   us, "I will give you rest."

   Next, we obtain rest by yielding to Christ. "Take My yoke upon you, . .
   . and ye shall find rest unto your souls." Christ bids us wear His
   yoke; not make one for ourselves. He wants us to share the yoke with
   Him, to be His true yoke-fellow. It is wonderful that He should be
   willing to be yoked with us; the only greater wonder is that we should
   be so unwilling to be yoked with Him. In taking His yoke upon us what
   joy we shall enter upon our eternal rest! Here we find rest unto our
   souls; a further rest beyond that which He gives us when we come to
   Him. We first rest in Jesus by faith, and then we rest in Him by
   obedience. The first rest He gives through His death; the further rest
   we find through copying His life.

   Lastly, we secure this rest by learning of Christ. "Learn of Me, for I
   am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls." We
   are to be workers with Christ, taking His yoke upon us; and, at the
   same time, we are to be scholars in Christ's school, learning of Him.
   We are to learn of Christ, and to learn Christ; He is both Teacher and
   lesson. His gentleness of heart fits Him to teach, and makes Him the
   best illustration of His own teaching. If we can become as He is, we
   shall rest as He does. The lowly in heart will be restful of heart.
   Now, as we come to the table of communion, may we find to the full that
   rest of which we have been speaking, for the Great Rest-Giver's sake!
   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE MEMORABLE HYMN. "And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the
                      mount of Olives."--Matthew xxvi. 30.

THE MEMORABLE HYMN.

   THE occasion on which these words were spoken was the last meal of
   which Jesus partook in company with His disciples before He went from
   them to His shameful trial and His ignominious death. It was His
   farewell supper before a bitter parting, and yet they needs must sing.
   He was on the brink of that great depth of misery into which He was
   about to plunge, and yet He would have them sing "an hymn." It is
   wonderful that He sang, and in a second degree it is remarkable that
   they sang. We will consider both singular facts.

   I. Let us dwell a while on the fact that Jesus sang at such a time as
   this. What does He teach us by it? Does He not say to each of us, His
   followers "My religion is one of happiness and joy; I, your Master, by
   My example would instruct you to sing even when the last solemn hour is
   come, and all the glooms of death are gathering around you? Here, at
   the table, I am your Singing-master, and set you lessons in music, in
   which My dying voice shall lead you: notwithstanding all the griefs
   which overwhelm My heart, I will be to you the Chief Musician, and the
   Sweet Singer of Israel"? If ever there was a time when it would have
   been natural and consistent with the solemnities of the occasion for
   the Saviour to have bowed His head upon the table, bursting into a
   flood of tears; or, if ever there was a season when He might have
   fittingly retired from all company, and have bewailed His coming
   conflict in sighs and groans, it was just then. But no; that brave
   heart will sing "an hymn." Our glorious Jesus plays the man beyond all
   other men. Boldest of the sons of men, He quails not in the hour of
   battle, but tunes His voice to loftiest psalmody. The genius of that
   Christianity of which Jesus is the Head and Founder, its object,
   spirit, and design, are happiness and joy, and they who receive it are
   able to sing in the very jaws of death.

   This remark, however, is quite a secondary one to the next: our Lord's
   complete fulfilment of the law is even more worthy of our attention. It
   was customary, when the Passover was held, to sing, and this is the
   main reason why the Saviour did so. During the Passover, it was usual
   to sing the hundred and thirteenth, and five following Psalms, which
   were called the "Hallel." The first commences, you will observe, in our
   version, with "Praise ye the Lord!" or, "Hallelujah!" The hundred and
   fifteenth, and the three following, were usually sung as the closing
   song of the Passover. Now, our Saviour would not diminish the splendour
   of the great Jewish rite, although it was the last time that He would
   celebrate it. No; there shall be the holy beauty and delight of
   psalmody; none of it shall be stinted; the "Hallel" shall be full and
   complete. We may safely believe that the Saviour sang through, or
   probably chanted, the whole of these six Psalms; and my heart tells me
   that there was no one at the table who sang more devoutly or more
   cheerfully than did our blessed Lord. There are some parts of the
   hundred and eighteenth Psalm, especially, which strike us as having
   sounded singularly grand, as they flowed from His blessed lips. Note
   verses 22, 23, 24. Particularly observe those words, near the end of
   the Psalm, and think you hear the Lord Himself singing them, "God is
   the Lord, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords,
   even unto the horns of the altar. Thou art my God, and I will praise
   Thee: Thou art my God, I will exalt Thee. O give thanks unto the Lord;
   for He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever."

   Because, then, it was the settled custom of Israel to recite or sing
   these Psalms, our Lord Jesus Christ did the same; for He would leave
   nothing unfinished. Just as, when He went down into the waters of
   baptism, He said, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness," so
   He seemed to say, when sitting at the table, "Thus it becometh us to
   fulfil all righteousness; therefore let us sing unto the Lord, as
   God's, people in past ages have done." Beloved, let us view with holy
   wonder the strictness of the Saviour's obedience to His Father's will,
   and let us endeavour to follow in His steps, in all things, seeking to
   be obedient to the Lord's Word in the little matters as well as in the
   great ones.

   May we not venture to suggest another and deeper reason? Did not the
   singing of "an hymn" at the supper show the holy absorption of the
   Saviour's soul in His Father's will? If, beloved, you knew that at--say
   ten o'clock to-night--you would be led away to be mocked, and despised,
   and scourged, and that tomorrow's sun would see you falsely accused,
   hanging, a convicted criminal, to die upon a cross, do you think that
   you could sing tonight, after your last meal? I am sure you could not,
   unless with more than earth born courage and resignation your soul
   could say, "Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the
   altar." You would sing if your spirit were like the Saviour's spirit;
   if, like Him, you could exclaim, "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt;" but
   if there should remain in you any selfishness, any desire to be spared
   the bitterness of death, you would not be able to chant the "Hallel"
   with the Master. Blessed Jesus, how wholly wert Thou given up! how
   perfectly consecrated! so that, whereas other men sing when they are
   marching to their joys, Thou didst sing on the way to death; whereas
   other men lift up their cheerful voices when honour awaits them, Thou
   hadst a brave and holy sonnet on Thy lips when shame, and spitting, and
   death were to be Thy portion.

   This singing of the Saviour also teaches us the whole-heartedness of
   the Master in the work which He was about to do. The patriot-warrior
   sings as he hastens to battle; to the strains of martial music he
   advances to meet the foeman; and even thus the heart of our
   all-glorious Champion supplies Him with song even in the dreadful hour
   of His solitary agony. He views the battle, but He dreads it not;
   though in the contest His soul will be "exceeding sorrowful even unto
   death," yet before it, He is like Job's war-horse, "he saith among the
   trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off." He has a
   baptism to be baptized with, and He is straitened until it be
   accomplished. The Master does not go forth to the agony in the garden
   with a cowed and trembling spirit, all bowed and crushed in the dust;
   but He advances to the conflict like a man who has his full strength
   about him--taken out to be a victim (if I may use such a figure), not
   as a worn-out ox that has long borne the yoke, but as the firstling of
   the bullock, in the fulness of His strength. He goes forth to the
   slaughter, with His glorious undaunted spirit fast and firm within Him,
   glad to suffer for His people's sake and for His Father's glory.

   "For as at first Thine all-pervading look

   Saw from Thy Father's bosom to th' abyss,

   Measuring in calm presage

   The infinite descent;

   So to the end, though now of mortal pangs

   Made heir, and emptied of Thy glory a while,

   With unaverted eye

   Thou meetest all the storm."

   Let us, O fellow-heirs of salvation, learn to sing when our suffering
   time comes, when our season for stern labour approaches; ay, let us
   pour forth a canticle of deep, mysterious, melody of bliss, when our
   dying hour is near at hand! Courage, brother! The waters are chilly;
   but fear will not by any means diminish the terrors of the river.
   Courage, brother! Death is solemn work; but playing the coward will not
   make it less so. Bring out the silver trumpet; let thy lips remember
   the long-loved music, and let the notes be clear and shrill as thou
   dippest thy feet in the Jordan: "Yea, though I walk through the valley
   of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy
   rod and Thy staff they comfort me." Dear friends, let the remembrance
   of the melodies of that upper room go with you tomorrow into business;
   and if you expect a great trial, and are afraid you will not be able to
   sing after it, then sing before it comes. Get your holy praise-work
   done before affliction mars the tune. Fill the air with music while you
   can. While yet there is bread upon the table, sing, though famine may
   threaten; while yet the child runs laughing about the house, while yet
   the flush of health is in your own cheek, while yet your goods are
   spared, while yet your heart is whole and sound, lift up your song of
   praise to the Most High God; and let your Master, the singing Saviour,
   be in this your goodly and comfortable example.

   There is much more that might be said concerning our Lord's sweet
   swan-song, but there is no need to crowd one thought out with another;
   your leisure will be well spent in meditation upon so fruitful a theme.

   II. We will now consider the singing of the disciples. They united in
   the "Hallel"--like true Jews, they joined in the national song. Israel
   had good cause to sing at the Passover, for God had wrought for His
   people what He had done for no other nation on the face of the earth.
   Every Hebrew must have felt his soul elevated and rejoiced on the
   Paschal night. He was "a citizen of no mean city," and the pedigree
   which he could look back upon was one, compared with which kings and
   princes were but of yesterday.

   Remembering the fact commemorated by the Paschal supper, Israel might
   well rejoice. They sang of their nation in bondage, trodden beneath the
   tyrannical foot of Pharaoh; they began the Psalm right sorrowfully, as
   they thought of the bricks made without straw, and of the iron furnace;
   but the strain soon mounted from the deep bass, and began to climb the
   scale, as they sang of Moses the servant of God, and of the Lord
   appearing to him in the burning bush. They remembered the mystic rod,
   which became a serpent, and which swallowed up the rods of the
   magicians; their music told of the plagues and wonders which God had
   wrought upon Zoan; and of that dread night when the first-born of Egypt
   fell before the avenging sword of the angel of death, while they
   themselves, feeding on the lamb which had been slain for them, and
   whose blood was sprinkled upon the lintel and upon the side-posts of
   the door, had been graciously preserved. Then the song went up
   concerning the hour in which all Egypt was humbled at the feet of
   Jehovah, whilst as for His people, He led them forth like sheep, by the
   hand of Moses and Aaron, and they went by the way of the sea, even of
   the Red Sea. The strain rose higher still as they tuned the song of
   Moses, the servant of God, and of the Lamb. Jubilantly they sang of the
   Red Sea, and of the chariots of Pharaoh which went down into the midst
   thereof, and the depths covered them till there was not one of them
   left. It was a glorious chant indeed when they sang of Rahab cut in
   pieces, and of the dragon wounded at the sea, by the right hand of the
   Most High, for the deliverance of the chosen people.

   But, beloved, if I have said that Israel could so properly sing, what
   shall I say of those of us who are the Lord's spiritually redeemed? We
   have been emancipated from a slavery worse than that of Egypt: "with a
   high hand and with an outstretched arm," hath God delivered us. The
   blood of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God's Passover, has been sprinkled
   on our hearts and consciences. By faith we keep the Passover, for we
   have been spared; we have been brought out of Egypt; and though our
   sins did once oppose us, they have all been drowned in the Red Sea of
   the atoning blood of Jesus: "the depths have covered them, there is not
   one of them left." If the Jew could sing a "great Hallel", our "Hallel"
   ought to be more glowing still; and if every house in "Judea's happy
   land" was full of music when the people ate the Paschal feast, much
   more reason have we for filling every heart with sacred harmony
   tonight, while we feast upon Jesus Christ, who was slain, and has
   redeemed us to God by His blood.

   III. The time has now come for me to say how earnestly I desire you to
   "sing an hymn."

   I do not mean to ask you to use your voices, but let your hearts be
   brimming with the essence of praise. Whenever we repair to the Lord's
   table, which represents to us the Passover, we ought not to come to it
   as to a funeral. Let us select solemn hymns, but not dirges. Let us
   sing softly, but none the less joyfully. These are no burial feasts;
   those are not funeral cakes which lie upon this table, and yonder fair
   white linen cloth is no winding-sheet. "This is My body," said Jesus,
   but the body so represented was no corpse, we feed upon a living
   Christ. The blood set forth by yonder wine is the fresh life-blood of
   our immortal King. We view not our Lord's body as clay-cold flesh,
   pierced with wounds, but as glorified at the right hand of the Father.
   We hold a happy festival when we break bread on the first day of the
   week. We come not hither trembling like bondsmen, cringing on our knees
   as wretched serfs condemned to eat on their knees; we approach as
   freemen to our Lord's banquet, like His apostles, to recline at length
   or sit at ease; not merely to eat bread which may belong to the most
   sorrowful, but to drink wine which belongs to men whose souls are glad.
   Let us recognize the rightness, yea, the duty of cheerfulness at this
   commemorative supper; and, therefore, let us "sing an hymn."

   Being satisfied on this point, perhaps you ask, "What hymn shall we
   sing?" Many sorts of hymns were sung in the olden time: look down the
   list, and you will scarcely find one which may not suit us now.

   One of the earliest of earthly songs was the war-song. They sang of old
   a song to the conqueror, when he returned from the battle. "Saul has
   slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands." Women took their
   timbrels, and rejoiced in the dance when the hero returned from the
   war. Even thus of old did the people of God extol Him for His mighty
   acts, singing aloud with the high-sounding cymbals: "Sing unto the
   Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously . . . The Lord is a man of war:
   the Lord is His name." My brethren, let us lift up a war-song to-night!
   Why not? "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
   Bozrah? this that is glorious in His apparel, travelling in the
   greatness of His strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to
   save." Come, let us praise our Emmanuel, as we see the head of our foe
   in His right hand; as we behold Him leading captivity captive,
   ascending up on high, with trumpets' joyful sound, let us chant the
   paean; let us shout the war-song, "Io Triumphe!" Behold, He comes, all
   glorious from the war: as we gather at this festive table, which
   reminds us both of His conflict and of His victory, let us salute Him
   with a psalm of gladsome triumph, which shall be but the prelude of the
   song we expect to sing when we get up--

   "Where all the singers meet."

   Another early, form of song was the pastoral. When he shepherds sat
   down amongst the sheep, they tuned their pipes, and warbled forth soft
   and sweet airs in harmony with rustic quietude. All around was calm and
   still; the sun was brightly shining, and the birds were making melody
   among the leafy branches. Shall I seem fanciful if I say, let us unite
   in a pastoral to-night? Sitting round the table, why should we not
   sing, "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie
   down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters"? If
   there be a place beneath the stars where one might feel perfectly at
   rest and ease, surely it is at the table of the Lord. Here, then, let
   us sing to our great Shepherd a pastoral of delight. Let the bleating
   of sheep be in our ears as we remember the Good Shepherd who laid down
   His life for His flock.

   You need not to be reminded that the ancients were very fond of festive
   songs. When they assembled at their great festivals, led by their
   chosen minstrels, they sang right joyously, with boisterous mirth. Let
   those who will speak to the praise of wine, my soul shall extol the
   precious blood of Jesus; let who will laud corn and oil, the rich
   produce of the harvest, my heart shall sing of the Bread which came
   down from heaven, whereof, if a man eateth, he shall never hunger.
   Speak ye of royal banquets, and minstrelsy fit for a monarch's ear?
   Ours is a nobler festival, and our song is sweeter far. Here is room at
   this table tonight for all earth's poesy and music, for the place
   deserves songs more lustrous with delight, more sparkling with gems of
   holy mirth, than any of which the ancients could conceive.

   "Now for a tune of lofty praise

   To great Jehovah's equal Son!

   Awake, my voice, in heavenly lays

   Tell the loud wonders He hath done!"

   The love-song we must not forget, for that is peculiarly the song of
   this evening. "Now will I sing unto my Well-beloved a song." His love
   to us is an immortal theme; and as our love, fanned by the breath of
   heaven, bursts into a vehement flame, we may sing, yea, and we will
   sing among the lilies, a song of loves.

   In the Old Testament, we find many Psalms called by the title, "A Song
   of Degrees." This "Song of Degrees" is supposed by some to have been
   sung as the people ascended the temple steps, or made pilgrimages to
   the holy place. The strain often changes, sometimes it is dolorous, and
   anon it is gladsome; at one season, the notes are long drawn out and
   heavy, at another, they are cheerful and jubilant. We will sing a "Song
   of Degrees" to-night. We will mourn that we pierced the Lord, and we
   wilt rejoice in pardon bought with blood. Our strain must vary as we
   talk of sin, feeling its bitterness, and lamenting it, and then of
   pardon, rejoicing in its glorious fulness.

   David wrote a considerable number of Psalms which he entitled,
   "Maschil," which may be called in English, "instructive Psalms." Where,
   beloved, can we find richer instruction than at the table of our Lord?
   He who understands the mystery of incarnation and of substitution, is a
   master in Scriptural theology. There is more teaching in the Saviour's
   body and in the Saviour's blood than in all the world besides. O ye who
   wish to learn the way to comfort, and how to tread the royal road to
   heavenly wisdom, come ye to the cross, and see the Saviour suffer, and
   pour out His heart's blood for human sin!

   Some of David's Psalms are called, "Michtam", which means "golden
   Psalm." Surely we must sing one of these. Our psalms must be golden
   when we sing of the Head of the Church, who is as much fine gold. More
   precious than silver or gold is the inestimable price which He has paid
   for our ransom. Yes, ye sons of harmony, bring your most melodious
   anthems here, and let your Saviour have your golden psalms!

   Certain Psalms in the Old Testament are entitled, "Upon Shoshannim,"
   that is, "Upon the lilies." O ye virgin souls, whose hearts have been
   washed in blood, and have been made white and pure, bring forth your
   instruments of song:-

   "Hither, then, your music bring,

   Strike aloud each cheerful string!"

   Let your hearts, when they are in their best state, when they are
   purest, and most cleansed from earthly dross, give to Jesus their glory
   and their excellence.

   Then there are other Psalms which are dedicated "To the sons of Korah."
   If the guess be right, the reason why we get the title, "To the sons of
   Korah"--"a song of loves,"--must be this: that when Korah, Dathan, and
   Abiram were swallowed up, the sons of Dathan and Abiram were swallowed
   up, too; but the sons of Korah perished not. Why they were not
   destroyed, we cannot tell. Perhaps it was that sovereign grace spared
   those whom justice might have doomed; and "the sons of Korah" were ever
   after made the sweet singers of the sanctuary; and whenever there was a
   special "song of loves", it was always dedicated to them. Ah! we will
   have one of those songs of love to-night, around the table, for we,
   too, are saved by distinguishing grace. We will sing of the heavenly
   Lover, and the many waters which could not quench His love.

   "Love, so vast that nought can bound;

   Love, too deep for thought to sound

   Love, which made the Lord of all

   Drink the wormwood and the gall.

   "Love, which led Him to the cross,

   Bearing there unutter'd loss;

   Love, which brought Him to the gloom

   Of the cold and darksome tomb.

   "Love, which made Him hence arise

   Far above the starry skies,

   There with tender, loving care,

   All His people's griefs to share.

   "Love, which will not let Him rest

   Till His chosen all are blest;

   Till they all for whom He died

   Live rejoicing by His side."

   We have not half exhausted the list, but it is clear that, sitting at
   the Lord's table, we shall have no lack of suitable psalmody. Perhaps
   no one hymn will quite meet the sentiments of all; and while we would
   not write a hymn for you, we would pray the Holy Spirit to write now
   the spirit of praise upon your hearts, that, sitting here, you may
   "after supper" sing "an hymn."

   IV. For one or two minutes let us ask--"what shall the tune be?" It
   must be a strange one, for if we are to sing "an hymn" to-night, around
   the table, the tune must have all the parts of music. Yonder believer
   is heavy of heart through manifold sorrows, bereavements, and watchings
   by the sick. He loves his Lord, and would fain praise Him, but his soul
   refuses to use her wings. Brother, we will have a tune in which you can
   join, and you shall lead the bass. You shall sing of your fellowship
   with your Beloved in His sufferings; how He, too, lost a friend; how He
   spent whole nights in sleeplessness; how His soul was exceeding
   sorrowful. But the tune must not be all bass, or it would not suit some
   of us to-night, for we can reach the highest note. We have seen the
   Lord, and our spirit has rejoiced in God our Saviour. We want to lift
   the chorus high; yea, there are some true hearts here who are at times
   so full of joy that they will want special music written for them.
   "Whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I
   cannot tell:" said Paul, and so have said others since, when Christ has
   been with them. Ah! then they have been obliged to mount to the highest
   notes, to the very loftiest range of song.

   Remember, beloved, that the same Saviour who will accept the joyful
   shoutings of the strong, will also receive the plaintive notes of the
   weak and weeping. You little ones, you babes in grace, may cry,
   "Hosanna," and the King will not silence you; and you strong men, with
   all your power of faith, may shout, "Hallelujah!" and your notes shall
   be accepted, too.

   Come, then, let us have a tune in which we can all unite; but ah! we
   cannot make one which will suit the dead--the dead, I mean, "in
   trespasses and sins"--and there are some such here. Oh, may God open
   their mouths, and unloose their tongues; but as for those of us who are
   alive unto God, let us, as we come to the table, all contribute our own
   share of the music, and so make up a song of blended harmony, with many
   parts, one great united song of praise to Jesus our Lord!

   We should not choose a tune for the communion table which is not very
   soft. These are no boisterous themes with which we have to deal when we
   tarry here. A bleeding Saviour, robed in a vesture dyed with
   blood--this is a theme which you must treat with loving gentleness, for
   everything that is coarse is out of place. While the tune is soft, it
   must also be sweet. Silence, ye doubts; be dumb, ye fears; be hushed,
   ye cares! Why come ye here? My music must be sweet and soft when I sing
   of Him. But oh! it must also be strong; there must be a full swell in
   my praise. Draw out the stops, and let the organ swell the diapason! In
   fulness let its roll of thundering harmony go up to heaven; let every
   note be sounded at its loudest. "Praise ye Him upon the cymbals, upon
   the high-sounding cymbals; upon the harp with a solemn sound." Soft,
   sweet, and strong, let the music be.

   Alas! you complain that your soul is out of tune. Then ask the Master
   to tune the heart-strings. Those "Selahs" which we find so often in the
   Psalms are supposed by many scholars to mean, "Put the harpstrings in
   tune:" truly we require many "Selahs," for our hearts are constantly
   unstrung. Oh, that to-night the Master would enable each one of us to
   offer that tuneful prayer which we so often sing,--

   "Teach me some melodious sonnet,

   Sung by flaming tongues above:

   Praise the mount--oh, fix me on it,

   Mount of God's unchanging love!"

   V. We close by enquiring,--who shall sing this hymn?

   Sitting around the Father's board, we will raise a joyful song, but who
   shall do it? "I will," saith one; "and we will," say others. What is
   the reason why so many are willing to join? The reason is to be found
   in the verse we were singing just now,--

   "When He's the subject of the song,

   Who can refuse to sing?"

   What! a Christian silent when others are praising his Master? No; he
   must join in the song. Satan tries to make God's people dumb, but he
   cannot, for the Lord has not a tongue-tied child in all His family.
   They can all speak, and they can all cry, even if they cannot all sing,
   and I think there are times when they can all sing; yea, they must, for
   you know the promise, "Then shall the tongue of the dumb sing." Surely,
   when Jesus leads the tune, if there should be any silent ones in the
   Lord's family, they must begin to praise the name of the Lord. After
   Giant Despair's head had been cut off, Christiana and Mr. Greatheart,
   and all the rest of them, brought out the best of their provisions, and
   made a feast, and Mr. Bunyan says that, after they had feasted, they
   danced. In the dance there was one remarkable dancer, namely, Mr.
   Ready-to-Halt. Now, Mr. Ready-to-Halt usually went upon crutches, but
   for once he laid them aside. "And," says Bunyan, "I warrant you he
   footed it well!" This is quaintly showing us that, sometimes, the very
   sorrowful ones, the Ready-to-Halts, when they see Giant Despair's head
   cut off, when they see death, hell, and sin led in triumphant captivity
   at the wheels of Christ's victorious chariot, feel that even they must
   for once indulge in a song of gladness. So, when I put the question
   to-night, "Who will sing?" I trust that Ready-to-Halt will promise, "I
   will."

   You have not much comfort at home, perhaps; by very hard work you earn
   that little. Sunday is to you a day of true rest, for you are worked
   very cruelly all the week. Those cheeks of yours, poor girl, are
   getting very pale, and who knows but what Hood's pathetic lines may be
   true of you?--

   "Stitch, stitch, stitch,

   In poverty, hunger, and dirt,

   Sewing at once, with a double thread,

   A shroud as well as a shirt."

   But, my sister, you may surely rejoice to-night in spite of all this.
   There may be little on earth, but there is much in heaven. There may be
   but small comfort for you here apart from Christ; but oh! when, by
   faith, you mount into His glory, your soul is glad. You shall be as
   rich as the richest to-night if the Holy Spirit shall but bring you to
   the table, and enable you to feed upon your Lord and Master. Perhaps
   you have come here to-night when you ought not to have done so. The
   physician would have told you to keep to your bed, but you persisted in
   coming up to the house where the Lord has so often met with you. I
   trust that we shall hear your voice in the song. There appear to have
   been in David's day many things to silence the praise of God, but David
   was one who would sing. I like that expression of his, where the devil
   seems to come up, and put his hand on his mouth, and say, "Be quiet."
   "No," says David, "I will sing." Again the devil tries to quiet him,
   but David is not to be silenced, for three times he puts it, "I will
   sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord." May the Lord make you
   resolve this night that you will praise the Lord Jesus with all your
   heart!

   Alas! there are many of you here to-night whom I could not invite to
   this feast of song, and who could not truly come if you were invited.
   Your sins are not forgiven; your souls are not saved; you have not
   trusted Christ; you are still in nature's darkness, still in the gall
   of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. Must it always be so? Will
   you destroy yourselves? Have you made a league with death, and a
   covenant with hell? Mercy lingers! Longsuffering continues! Jesus
   waits! Remember that He hung upon the cross for sinners such as you
   are, and that if you believe in Him now, you shall be saved. One act of
   faith, and all the sin you have committed is blotted out. A single
   glance of faith's eye to the wounds of the Messiah, and your load of
   iniquity is rolled into the depths of the sea, and you are forgiven in
   a moment!

   "Oh!" says one, "would God I could believe!" Poor soul, may God help
   thee to believe now! God took upon Himself our flesh; Christ was born
   among men, and suffered on account of human guilt, being made to suffer
   "the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." Christ was
   punished in the room, place, and stead of every man and woman who will
   believe on Him. If you believe on Him, He was punished for you; and you
   will never be punished. Your debts are paid, your sins are forgiven.
   God cannot punish you, for He has punished Christ instead of you, and
   He will never punish twice for one offence. To believe is to trust. If
   you will now trust your soul entirely with Him, you are saved, for He
   loved you, and gave Himself for you. When you know this, and feel it to
   be true, then come to the Lord's table, and join with us, when, after
   supper we sing our hymn,--

   "It is finished!'--Oh, what pleasure

   Do these charming words afford!

   Heavenly blessings without measure

   Flow to us from Christ the Lord:

   It is finished!'

   Saints, the dying words record.

   "Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs,

   Join to sing the pleasing theme;

   All on earth, and all in heaven,

   Join to praise Immanuel's name!

   Hallelujah!

   Glory to the bleeding Lamb!"
     __________________________________________________________________

JESUS ASLEEP ON A PILLOW"And He was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a
 pillow: and they awake Him, and say unto Him, Master, carest Thou not that we
  perish? And He arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be
   still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."--Mark iv. 38, 39.


   OUR Lord took His disciples with Him into the ship to teach them a
   practical lesson. It is one thing to talk to people about our oneness
   with them, and about how they should exercise faith in time of danger,
   and about their real safety in apparent peril; but it is another, and a
   far better thing, to go into the ship with them, to let them feel all
   the terror of the storm, and then to arise, and rebuke the wind, and
   say unto the sea, "Peace, be still." Our Lord gave His disciples a kind
   of Kindergarten lesson, an acted sermon, in which the truth was set
   forth visibly before them. Such teaching produced a wonderful effect
   upon their lives. May we also be instructed by it!

   In our text there are two great calms; the first is, the calm in the
   Saviour's heart, and the second is, the calm which He created with a
   word upon the storm-tossed sea.

   I. Within the Lord where was a great calm, and that is why there was
   soon a great calm around Him; for what is in God comes out of God.
   Since there was a calm in Christ for Himself, there was afterwards a
   calm outside for others. What a wonderful inner calm it was! "He was in
   the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow."

   He had perfect confidence in God that all was well. The waves might
   roar, the winds might rage, but He was not at all disquieted by their
   fury. He knew that the waters were in the hollow of His Father's hand,
   and that every wind was but the breath of His Father's mouth; and so He
   was not troubled; nay, He had not even a careful thought, He was as
   much at ease as on a sunny day. His mind and heart were free from every
   kind of care, for amid the gathering tempest He deliberately laid
   Himself down, and slept like a weary child. He went to the hinder part
   of the ship, most out of the gash of the spray; He took a pillow, and
   put it under His head, and with fixed intent disposed Himself to
   slumber. It was His own act and deed to go to sleep in the storm; He
   had nothing for which to keep awake, so pure and perfect was His
   confidence in the great Father. What an example this is to us! We have
   not half the confidence in God that we ought to have, not even the best
   of us. The Lord deserves our unbounded belief, our unquestioning
   confidence, our undisturbed reliance. Oh, that we rendered it to Him as
   the Saviour did!

   There was also mixed with His faith in the Father a sweet confidence in
   His own Sonship. He did not doubt that He was the Son of the Highest. I
   may not question God's power to deliver, but I may sometimes question
   my right to expect deliverance; and if so, my comfort vanishes. Our
   Lord had no doubts of this kind. He had long before heard that word,
   "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased;" He had so lived
   and walked with God that the witness within Him was continuous, so He
   had no question about the Father's love to Him as His own Son. "Rocked
   in the cradle of the deep," His Father keeping watch over Him,--what
   could a child do better than go to sleep in such a happy position? And
   so He does. You and I, too, want a fuller assurance of our sonship if
   we would have greater peace with God. The devil knows that, and
   therefore he will come to us with his insinuating suggestion, "If thou
   be the son of God." If we have the Spirit of adoption in us, we shall
   put the accuser to rout at once, by opposing the Witness within to his
   question from without. Then shall we be filled with a great calm,
   because we have confidence in our Father, and assurance of our sonship.

   Then He had a sweet way--this blessed Lord of ours--of leaving all with
   God. He takes no watch, He makes no fret; but He goes to sleep.
   Whatever comes, He has left all in the hands of the great Caretaker;
   and what more is needful? If a watchman were set to guard my house, I
   should be foolish if I also sat up for fear of thieves. Why have a
   watchman if I cannot trust him to watch? "Cast thy burden upon the
   Lord;" but when thou hast done so, leave it with the Lord, and do not
   try to carry it thyself. That is to make a mock of God, to have the
   name of God, but not the reality, of God. Lay down every care, even as
   Jesus did when He went calmly to the hinder part of the ship, and
   quietly took a pillow, and went to sleep.

   But I think I hear someone say, "I could do that if mine were solely
   care about myself." Yes, perhaps you could; and yet you cannot cast
   upon God your burden of care about your children. But your Lord trusted
   the Father with those dear to Him. Do you not think that Christ's
   disciples were as precious to Him as our children are to us? If that
   ship had been wrecked, what would have become of Peter? What would have
   become of "that disciple whom Jesus loved"? Our Lord regarded with
   intense affection those whom He had chosen and called, and who had been
   with Him in His temptation, yet He was quite content to leave them all
   in the care of His Father, and go to sleep.

   You answer, "Yes, but there is a still wider circle of people watching
   to see what will happen to me, and to the cause of Christ with which I
   am connected. I am obliged to care, whether I will or no." Is your
   case, then, more trying than your Lord's? Do you forget that "there
   were also with Him many other little ships"? When the storm was tossing
   His barque, their little ships were even more in jeopardy; and He cared
   for them all. He was the Lord High Admiral of the Lake of Gennesaret
   that night. The other ships were a fleet under His convoy, and His
   great heart went out to them all. Yet He went to sleep, because He had
   left in His Father's care even the solicitudes of His charity and
   sympathy. We, my brethren, who are much weaker than He, shall find
   strength in doing the same.

   Having left everything with His Father, our Lord did the very wisest
   thing possible. He did just what the hour demanded. "Why," say you, "He
   went to sleep!" That was the best thing Jesus could do; and sometimes
   it is the best thing we can do. Christ was weary and worn; and when
   anyone is exhausted, it is his duty to go to sleep if he can. The
   Saviour must be up again in the morning, preaching and working
   miracles, and if He does not sleep, He will not be fit for His holy
   duty; it is incumbent upon Him to keep Himself in trim for His service.
   Knowing that the time to sleep has come, the Lord sleeps, and does well
   in sleeping. Often, when we have been fretting and worrying, we should
   have glorified God far more had we literally gone to sleep. To glorify
   God by sleep is not so difficult as some might think; at least, to our
   Lord it was natural. Here you are worried, sad, wearied; the doctor
   prescribes for you; his medicine does you no good; but oh! if you enter
   into full peace with God, and go to sleep, you will wake up infinitely
   more refreshed than by any drug. The sleep which the Lord giveth to His
   beloved is balmy indeed. Seek it as Jesus sought it. Go to bed,
   brother, and you will better imitate your Lord than by putting yourself
   into ill humour, and worrying other people.

   There is a spiritual sleep in which we ought to imitate Jesus. How
   often I have worried my poor brain about my great church, until I have
   come to my senses, and then I have said to myself, "How foolish you
   are! Can you not depend upon God? Is it not far more His cause than
   yours?" Then I have taken my load in prayer, and left it with the Lord.
   I have said, "In God's name, this matter shall never worry me again,"
   and I have left my urgent care with Him, and ended it for ever. I have
   so deliberately given up many a trying case into the Lord's care that,
   when any of my friends have said to me, "What about so and so?" I have
   simply answered, "I do not know, and I am no longer careful to know.
   The Lord will interpose in some way or other, but I will trouble no
   more about it." No mischief has ever come through any matter which I
   have left in the divine keeping. The staying of my hand has been
   wisdom. "Stand still, and see the salvation of God" is God's own
   precept. Here let us follow Jesus. Having a child's confidence in the
   great Father, He retires to the stern of the ship, selects a pillow,
   deliberately lies down upon it, and goes to sleep; and though the ship
   is filling with water, and rolls and pitches, He sleeps on. Nothing can
   break the peace of His tranquil soul. Every sailor on board reels to
   and fro, and staggers like a drunken man, and is at his wits' end; but
   Jesus is neither at his wits' end, nor does He stagger, for He rests in
   perfect innocence, and undisturbed confidence. His heart is happy in
   God, and therefore doth He remain in repose. Oh, for grace to copy Him!

   II. But here notice, dear friends, The difference between the Master
   and His disciples; for while He was in a great calm, they were in a
   great storm. Here see their failure. They were just as we are, and we
   are often just as they were.

   They gave way to fear. They were sorely afraid that the ship would
   sink, and that they would all perish. In thus yielding to fear, they
   forgot the solid reasons for courage which lay near at hand; for, in
   truth, they were safe enough. Christ is on board that vessel, and if
   the ship goes down, He will sink with them. The heathen mariner took
   courage during a storm from the fact that Caesar was on board the ship
   that was tossed by stormy winds; and should not the disciples feel
   secure with Jesus on board? Fear not, ye carry Jesus and His cause!
   Jesus had come to do a work, and His disciples might have known that He
   could not perish with that work unaccomplished. Could they not trust
   Him? They had seen Him multiply the loaves and fishes, and cast out
   devils, and heal all manner of sicknesses; could they not trust Him to
   still the storm? Unreasonable unbelief! Faith in God is true prudence,
   but to doubt God is irrational. It is the height of absurdity and folly
   to question omnipotent love.

   And the disciples were so unwise as to do the Master a very ill turn.
   He was sadly weary, and sorely needed sleep; but they hastened to Him,
   and aroused Him in a somewhat rough and irreverent manner. They were
   slow to do so, but their fear urged them; and therefore they awoke Him,
   uttering ungenerous and unloving words: "Master, carest Thou not that
   we perish?" Shame on the lips that asked so harsh a question! Did they
   not upon reflection greatly blame themselves? He had given them no
   cause for such hard speeches; and, moreover, it was unseemly in them to
   call Him "Master," and then to ask Him, "Carest Thou not that we
   perish?" Is He to be accused of such hard-heartednesses to let His
   faithful disciples perish when He has power to deliver them? Alas, we,
   too, have been guilty of like offences! I think I have known some of
   Christ's disciples who have appeared to doubt the wisdom or the love of
   their Lord. They did not quite say that He was mistaken, but they said
   that He moved in a mysterious way; they did not quite complain that He
   was unkind to them, but they whispered that they could not reconcile
   His dealings with His infinite love. Alas, Jesus has endured much from
   our unbelief! May this picture help us to see our spots, and may the
   love of our dear Lord remove them!

   III. I have spoken to you of the Master's calm and of the disciples'
   failure; now let us think of the great calm which Jesus created. "There
   was a great calm."

   His voice produced it. They say that if oil be poured upon the waters
   they will become smooth, and I suppose there is some truth in the
   statement; but there is all truth in this, that if God speaks, the
   storm subsides into a calm, so that the waves of the sea are still. It
   only needs our Lord Jesus to speak in the heart of any one of us, and
   immediately the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, will
   possess us. No matter how drear your despondency, nor how dread your
   despair, the Lord can at once create a great calm of confidence. What a
   door of hope this opens to any who are in trouble! If I could speak a
   poor man rich, and a sick one well, I am sure I would do so at once;
   but Jesus is infinitely better than I am, and therefore I know that He
   will speak peace to the tried and troubled heart.

   Note, too, that this calm came at once. "Jesus arose, and rebuked the
   wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and
   there was a great calm." As soon as Jesus spoke, all was quiet. I have
   met with a very large number of persons in trouble of mind, and I have
   seen a few who have slowly come out into light and liberty; but more
   frequently deliverance has come suddenly. The iron gate has opened of
   its own accord, and the prisoner has stepped into immediate freedom.
   "The snare is broken, and we are escaped." What a joy it is to know
   that rest is so near even when the tempest rages most furiously!

   Note, also, that the Saviour coupled this repose with faith, for He
   said to the disciples as soon as the calm came, "Why are ye so fearful?
   How is it that ye have no faith?" Faith and the calm go together. If
   thou believest, thou shalt rest; if thou wilt but cast thyself upon thy
   God, surrendering absolutely to His will, thou shalt have mercy, and
   joy, and light. Even if we have no faith, the Lord will sometimes give
   us the blessing that we need, for He delights to do more for us than we
   have any right to expect of Him; but usually the rule of His kingdom
   is, "According to your faith be it unto you."

   This great calm is very delightful, and concerning this I desire to
   bear my personal testimony. I speak from my own knowledge when I say
   that it passeth all understanding. I was sitting, the other night,
   meditating on God's mercy and love, when suddenly I found in my own
   heart a most delightful sense of perfect peace. I had come to
   Beulah-land, where the sun shines without a cloud. "There was a great
   calm." I felt as mariners might do who have been tossed about in broken
   water, and all on a sudden, they cannot tell why, the ocean becomes as
   unruffled as a mirror, and the sea-birds come and sit in happy circles
   upon the water. I felt perfectly content, yea, undividedly happy. Not a
   wave of trouble broke upon the shore of my heart, and even far out to
   sea in the deeps of my being all was still. I knew no ungratified wish,
   no unsatisfied desire. I could not discover a reason for uneasiness, or
   a motive for fear. There was nothing approaching to fanaticism in my
   feelings, nothing even of excitement: my soul was waiting upon God, and
   delighting herself alone in Him. Oh, the blessedness of this rest in
   the Lord! What an Elysium it is! I must be allowed to say a little upon
   this purple island in the sea of my life: it was none other than a
   fragment of heaven. We often talk about our great spiritual storms, why
   should we not speak of our great calms? If ever we get into trouble,
   what a noise we make of it! Why should we not sing of our deliverances?

   Let us survey our mercies. Every sin that we have ever committed is
   forgiven. "The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all
   sin." The power of sin within us is broken; it "shall not have dominion
   over you, for ye are not under the law but under grace." Satan is a
   vanquished enemy; the world is overcome by our Lord Jesus, and death is
   abolished by Him. All providence works for our good. Eternity has no
   threat for us, it bears within its mysteries nothing but immortality
   and glory. Nothing can harm us. The Lord is our shield, and our
   exceeding great reward. Wherefore, then, should we fear? The Lord of
   hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge. To the believer,
   peace is no presumption: he is warranted in enjoying "perfect peace"--a
   quiet which is deep, and founded on truth, which encompasses all
   things, and is not broken by any of the ten thousand disturbing causes
   which otherwise might prevent our rest. "Thou wilt keep him in perfect
   peace whose mind is stayed on Thee; because he trusteth in Thee." Oh,
   to get into that calm, and remain in it till we come to that world
   where there is no more sea!

   A calm like that which ruled within our Saviour should we be happy
   enough to attain to it, will give us in our measure the power to make
   outside matters calm. He that hath peace can make peace. We cannot work
   miracles, and yet the works which Jesus did shall we do also. Sleeping
   His sleep, we shall awake in His rested energy, and treat the winds and
   waves as things subject to the power of faith, and therefore to be
   commanded into quiet. We shall speak so as to console others: our calm
   shall work marvels in the little ships whereof others are captains. We,
   too, shall say, "Peace! Be still." Our confidence shall prove
   contagious, and the timid shall grow brave: our tender love shall
   spread itself, and the contentious shall cool down to patience. Only
   the matter must begin within ourselves. We cannot create a calm till we
   are in a calm. It is easier to rule the elements than to govern the
   unruliness of our wayward nature. When grace has made us masters of our
   fears, so that we can take a pillow and fall asleep amid the hurricane,
   the fury of the tempest is over. He giveth peace and safety when He
   giveth His beloved sleep.

   REAL CONTACT WITH JESUS. "And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched Me: for I
            perceive that virtue is gone out of Me."--Luke viii. 46.

REAL CONTACT WITH JESUS.

   OUR Lord was very frequently in the midst of a crowd. His preaching was
   so plain and so forcible that He always attracted a vast company of
   hearers; and, moreover, the rumour of the loaves and fishes no doubt
   had something to do with increasing His audiences, while the
   expectation of beholding a miracle would be sure to add to the numbers
   of the hangers-on. Our Lord Jesus Christ often found it difficult to
   move through the streets, because of the masses who pressed upon Him.
   This was encouraging to Him as a preacher, and yet how small a residuum
   of real good came of all the excitement which gathered around His
   personal ministry! He might have looked upon the great mass, and have
   said, "What is the chaff to the wheat?" for here it was piled up upon
   the threshing-floor, heap upon heap; and yet, after His decease, His
   disciples might have been counted by a few scores, for those who had
   spiritually received Him were but few. Many were called, but few were
   chosen. Yet, wherever one was blessed, our Saviour took note of it; it
   touched a chord in His soul. He never could be unaware when virtue had
   gone out of Him to heal a sick one, or when power had gone forth with
   His ministry to save a sinful one. Of all the crowd that gathered round
   the Saviour upon the day of which our text speaks, I find nothing said
   about one of them except this solitary "somebody" who had touched Him.
   The crowd came, and the crowd went; but little is recorded of it all.
   Just as the ocean, having advanced to full tide, leaves but little
   behind it when it retires again to its channel, so the vast multitude
   around the Saviour left only this one precious deposit--one "somebody"
   who had touched Him, and had received virtue from Him.

   Ah, my Master, it may be so again this evening! These Sabbath mornings,
   and these Sabbath evenings, the crowds come pouring in like a mighty
   ocean, filling this house, and then they all retire again; only here
   and there is a "somebody" left weeping for sin, a "somebody" left
   rejoicing in Christ, a "somebody" who can say, "I have touched the hem
   of His garment, and I have been made whole." The whole of my other
   hearers are not worth the "somebodies." The many of you are not worth
   the few, for the many are the pebbles, and the few are the diamonds;
   the many are the heaps of husks, and the few are the precious grains.
   May God find them out at this hour, and His shall be all the praise!

   Jesus said, "Somebody hath touched Me," from which we observe that, in
   the use of means and ordinances, we should never be satisfied unless we
   get into personal contact with Christ, so that we touch Him, as this
   woman touched His garment. Secondly, if we can get into such personal
   contact, we shall have a blessing: "I perceive that virtue is gone out
   of Me;" and, thirdly, if we do get a blessing, Christ will know it;
   however obscure our case may be, He will know it, and He will have us
   let others know it; He will speak, and ask such questions as will draw
   us out, and manifest us to the world.

   I. First, then, in the use of all means and ordinances, let it be our
   chief aim and object to come into personal contact with the Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Peter said, "The multitude throng Thee, and press Thee," and that is
   true of the multitude to this very day; but of those who come where
   Christ is in the assembly of His saints, a large proportion only come
   because it is their custom to do so. Perhaps they hardly know why they
   go to a place of worship. They go because they always did go, and they
   think it wrong not to go. They are just like the doors which swing upon
   their hinges; they take no interest in what is done, at least only in
   the exterior parts of the service; into the heart and soul of the
   business they do not enter, and cannot enter. They are glad if the
   sermon is rather short, there is so much the less tedium for them. They
   are glad if they can look around and gaze at the congregation, they
   find in that something to interest them; but getting near to the Lord
   Jesus is not the business they come upon. They have not looked at it in
   that light. They come and they go; they come and they go; and it will
   be so till, by-and-by, they will come for the last time, and they will
   find out in the next world that the means of grace were not instituted
   to be matters of custom, and that to have heard Jesus Christ preached,
   and to have rejected Him, is no trifle, but a solemn thing for which
   they will have to answer in the presence of the great Judge of all the
   earth.

   Others there are who come to the house of prayer, and try to enter into
   the service, and do so in a certain fashion; but it is only
   self-righteously or professionally. They may come to the Lord's table;
   perhaps they attend to baptism; they may even join the church. They are
   baptized, yet not by the Holy Spirit; they take the Lord's supper, but
   they take not the Lord Himself; they eat the bread, but they never eat
   His flesh; they drink the wine, but they never drink His blood; they
   have been buried in the pool, but they have never been buried with
   Christ in baptism, nor have they risen again with Him into newness of
   life. To them, to read, to sing, to kneel, to hear, and so on, are
   enough. They are content with the shell, but the blessed spiritual
   kernel, the true marrow and fatness, these they know nothing of. These
   are the many, go into what church or meeting-house you please. They are
   in the press around Jesus, but they do not touch Him. They come, but
   they come not into contact with Jesus. They are outward, external
   hearers only, but there is no inward touching of the blessed person of
   Christ, no mysterious contact with the ever-blessed Saviour, no stream
   of life and love flowing from Him to them. It is all mechanical
   religion. Of vital godliness, they know nothing.

   But, "somebody," said Christ, "somebody hath touched Me," and that is
   the soul of the matter. O my hearer, when you are in prayer alone,
   never be satisfied with having prayed; do not give it up till you have
   touched Christ in prayer; or, if you have not got to Him, at any rate
   sigh and cry until you do! Do not think you have prayed, but try again.
   When you come to public worship, I beseech you, rest not satisfied with
   listening to the sermon, and so on, as you all do with sufficient
   attention; to that I bear you witness;--but do not be content unless
   you get at Christ the Master, and touch Him. At all times when you come
   to the communion table, count it to have been no ordinance of grace to
   you unless you have gone right through the veil into Christ's own arms,
   or at least have touched His garment, feeling that the first object,
   the life and soul of the means of grace, is to touch Jesus Christ
   Himself; and except "somebody" hath touched Him, the whole has been a
   mere dead performance, without life or power.

   The woman in our text was not only amongst those who were in the crowd,
   but she touched Jesus; and therefore, beloved, let me hold her up to
   your example in some respects, though I would to God that in other
   respects you might excel her.

   Note, first, she felt that it was of no use being in the crowd, of no
   use to be in the same street with Christ, or near to the place where
   Christ was, but she must get at Him; she must touch Him. She touched
   Him, you will notice, under many difficulties. There was a great crowd.
   She was a woman. She was also a woman enfeebled by a long disease which
   had drained her constitution, and left her more fit to be upon a bed
   than to be struggling in the seething tumult. Yet, notwithstanding
   that, so intense was her desire, that she urged on her way, I doubt not
   with many a bruise, and many an uncouth push, and at last, poor
   trembler as she was, she got near to the Lord. Beloved, it is not
   always easy to get at Jesus. It is very easy to kneel down to pray, but
   not so easy to reach Christ in prayer. There is a child crying, it is
   your own, and its noise has often hindered you when you were striving
   to approach Jesus; or a knock will come at the door when you most wish
   to be retired. When you are sitting in the house of God, your neighbour
   in the seat before you may unconsciously distract your attention. It is
   not easy to draw near to Christ, especially coming as some of you do
   right away from the counting-house, and from the workshop, with a
   thousand thoughts and cares about you. You cannot always unload your
   burden outside, and come in here with your hearts prepared to receive
   the gospel. Ah! it is a terrible fight sometimes, a real foot-to-foot
   fight with evil, with temptation, and I know not what. But, beloved, do
   fight it out, do fight it out; do not let your seasons for prayer be
   wasted, nor your times for hearing be thrown away; but, like this
   woman, be resolved, with all your feebleness, that you will lay hold
   upon Christ. And oh! if you be resolved about it, if you cannot get to
   Him, He will come to you, and sometimes, when you are struggling
   against unbelieving thoughts, He will turn and say, "Make room for that
   poor feeble one, that she may come to Me, for My desire is to the work
   of My own hands; let her come to Me, and let her desire be granted to
   her."

   Observe, again, that this woman touched Jesus very secretly. Perhaps
   there is a dear sister here who is getting near to Christ at this very
   moment, and yet her face does not betray her. It is so little contact
   that she has gained with Christ that the joyous flush, and the sparkle
   of the eye, which we often see in the child of God, have not yet come
   to her. She is sitting in yonder obscure corner, or standing in this
   aisle, but though her touch is secret, it is true. Though she cannot
   tell another of it, yet it is accomplished. She has touched Jesus.
   Beloved, that is not always the nearest fellowship with Christ of which
   we talk the most. Deep waters are still. Nay, I am not sure but what we
   sometimes get nearer to Christ when we think we are at a distance than
   we do when we imagine we are near Him, for we are not always exactly
   the best judges of our own spiritual state, and we may be very close to
   the Master, and yet for all that we may be so anxious to get closer
   that we may feel dissatisfied with the measure of grace which we have
   already received. To be satisfied with self, is no sign of grace; but
   to long for more grace, is often a far better evidence of the healthy
   state of the soul. Friend, if thou canst not come to the table to-night
   publicly, come to the Master in secret. If thou darest not tell thy
   wife, or thy child, or thy father, that thou art trusting in Jesus, it
   need not be told as yet. Thou mayest do it secretly, as he did to whom
   Jesus said, "When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee." Nathanael
   retired to the shade that no one might see him; but Jesus saw him, and
   marked his prayer, and He will see thee in the crowd, and in the dark,
   and not withhold His blessing.

   This woman also came into contact with Christ under a very deep sense
   of unworthiness. I dare say she thought, "If I touch the Great Prophet,
   it will be a wonder if He does not strike me with some sudden
   judgment," for she was a woman ceremonially unclean. She had no right
   to be in the throng. Had the Levitical law been strictly carried out, I
   suppose she would have been confined to her house; but there she was
   wandering about, and she must needs go and touch the holy Saviour. Ah!
   poor heart, you feel to-night that you are not fit to touch the skirts
   of the Master's robe, for you are so unworthy. You never felt so
   undeserving before as you do to-night. In the recollection of last week
   and its infirmities, in the remembrance of the present state of your
   heart, and all its wanderings from God, you feel as if there never was
   so worthless a sinner in the house of God before. "Is grace for me?"
   say you. "Is Christ for me?" Oh! yes, unworthy one. Do not be put off
   without it. Jesus Christ does not save the worthy, but the unworthy.
   Your plea must not be righteousness, but guilt. And you, too, child of
   God, though you are ashamed of yourself, Jesus is not ashamed of you;
   and though you feel unfit to come, let your unfitness only impel you
   with the greater earnestness of desire. Let your sense of need make you
   the more fervent to approach the Lord, who can supply your need.

   Thus, you see, the woman came under difficulties, she came secretly,
   she came as an unworthy one, but still she obtained the blessing.

   I have known many staggered with that saying of Paul's, "He that eateth
   and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself."
   Now, understand that this passage does not refer to the unworthiness of
   those persons who come to the Lord's table; for it does not say, "He
   that eateth and drinketh being unworthy." It is not an adjective; it is
   an adverb: "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily," that is to say, he
   who shall come to the outward and visible sign of Christ's presence,
   and shall eat of the bread in order to obtain money being a member of
   the church, knowing himself to be a hypocrite, or who shall do it
   jestingly, trifling with the ordinance: such a person would be eating
   and drinking unworthily, and he will be condemned. The sense of the
   passage is, not "damnation", as our version reads it, but
   "condemnation." There can be no doubt that members of the church,
   coming to the Lord's table in an unworthy manner, do receive
   condemnation. They are condemned for so doing, and the Lord is grieved.
   If they have any conscience at all, they ought to feel their sin; and
   if not, they may expect the chastisements of God to visit them. But, O
   sinner, as to coming to Christ,--which is a very different thing from
   coming to the Lord's table,--as to coming to Christ, the more unworthy
   you feel yourself to be, the better. Come, thou filthy one, for Christ
   can wash thee. Come, thou loathsome one, for Christ can beautify thee.
   Come utterly ruined and undone, for in Jesus Christ there is the
   strength and salvation which thy case requires.

   Notice, once again, that this woman touched the Master very
   tremblingly, and it was only a hurried touch, but still it was the
   touch of faith. Oh, beloved, to lay hold on Christ! Be thankful if you
   do but get near Him for a few minutes. "Abide with me," should be your
   prayer; but oh, if He only give you a glimpse, be thankful! Remember
   that a touch healed the woman. She did not embrace Christ by the hour
   together. She had but a touch, and she was healed; and oh, may you have
   a sight of Jesus now, my beloved! Though it be but a glimpse, yet it
   will gladden and cheer your souls. Perhaps you are waiting on Christ,
   desiring His company, and while you are turning it over in your mind
   you are asking, "Will He ever shine upon me? Will He ever speak loving
   words to me? Will He ever let me sit at His feet? Will He ever permit
   me to lean my head upon His bosom?" Come and try Him. Though you should
   shake like an aspen leaf, yet come. They sometimes come best who come
   most tremblingly, for when the creature is lowest then is the Creator
   highest, and when in our own esteem we are less than nothing and
   vanity, then is Christ the more fair and lovely in our eyes. One of the
   best ways of climbing to heaven is on our hands and knees. At any rate,
   there is no fear of falling when we are in that position, for--

   "He that is down need fear no fall."

   Let your lowliness of heart, your sense of utter nothingness, instead
   of disqualifying you, be a sweet medium for leading you to receive more
   of Christ. The more empty I am, the more room is there for my Master.
   The more I lack, the more He will give me. The more I feel my sickness,
   the more shall I adore and bless Him when He makes me whole.

   You see, the woman did really touch Christ, and so I come back to that.
   Whatever infirmity there was in the touch, it was a real touch of
   faith. She did reach Christ Himself. She did not touch Peter; that
   would have been of no use to her, any more than it is for the parish
   priest to tell you that you are regenerate when your life soon proves
   that you are not. She did not touch John or James; that would have been
   of no more good to her than it is for you to be touched by a bishop's
   hands, and to be told that you are confirmed in the faith, when you are
   not even a believer, and therefore have no faith to be confirmed in.
   She touched the Master Himself; and, I pray you, do not be content
   unless you can do the same. Put out the hand of faith, and touch
   Christ. Rest on Him. Rely on His bloody sacrifice, His dying love, His
   rising power, His ascended plea; and as you rest in Him, your vital
   touch, however feeble, will certainly give you the blessing your soul
   needs.

   This brings us to the second part of our discourse, upon which I will
   say only a little.

   II. The woman in the crowd did touch Jesus, and, having done so, she
   received virtue from Him.

   The healing energy streamed at once through the finger of faith into
   the woman. In Christ, there is healing for all spiritual diseases.
   There is a speedy healing, a healing which will not take months nor
   years, but which is complete in one second. There is in Christ a
   sufficient healing, though your diseases should be multiplied beyond
   all bounds. There is in Christ an all-conquering power to drive out
   every ill. Though, like this woman, you baffle physicians, and your
   case is reckoned desperate beyond all parallel, yet a touch of Christ
   will heal you. What a precious, glorious gospel I have to preach to
   sinners! If they touch Jesus, no matter though the devil himself were
   in them, that touch of faith would drive the devil out of them. Though
   you were like the man into whom there had entered a legion of devils,
   the word of Jesus would cast them all into the deep, and you should sit
   at His feet, clothed, and in your right mind. There is no excess or
   extravagance of sin which the power of Jesus Christ cannot overcome. If
   thou canst believe, whatever thou mayest have been, thou shalt be
   saved. If thou canst believe, though thou hast been lying in the
   scarlet dye till the warp and woof of thy being are ingrained
   therewith, yet shall the precious blood of Jesus make thee white as
   snow. Though thou art become black as hell itself, and only fit to be
   cast into the pit, yet if thou trustest Jesus, that simple faith shall
   give to thy soul the healing which shall make thee fit to tread the
   streets of heaven, and to stand before Jehovah-Rophi's face, magnifying
   the Lord that healeth thee.

   And now, child of God, I want you to learn the same lesson. Very
   likely, when you came in here, you said,--"Alas! I feel very dull; my
   spirituality is at a very low ebb; the place is hot, and I do not feel
   prepared to hear; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak; I shall
   have no holy enjoyment to-day!" Why not? Why, the touch of Jesus could
   make you live if you were dead, and surely it will stir the life that
   is in you, though it may seem to you to be expiring! Now, struggle
   hard, my beloved, to get at Jesus! May the Eternal Spirit come and help
   you, and may you yet find that your dull, dead times can soon become
   your best times. Oh! what a blessing it is that God takes the beggar up
   from the dunghill! He does not raise us when He sees us already up, but
   when He finds us lying on the dunghill, then He delights to lift us up,
   and set us among princes. Or ever you are aware, your soul may become
   like the chariots of Ammi-nadib. Up from the depths of heaviness to the
   very heights of ecstatic worship you may mount as in a single moment if
   you can but touch Christ crucified. View Him yonder, with streaming
   wounds, with thorn-crowned head, as in all the majesty of His misery,
   He expires for you!

   "Alas!" say you, "I have a thousand doubts tonight." Ah! but your
   doubts will soon vanish when you draw nigh to Christ. He never doubts
   who feels the touch of Christ, at least, not while the touch lasts, for
   observe this woman! She felt in her body that she was made whole, and
   so shall you, if you will only come into contact with the Lord. Do not
   wait for evidences, but come to Christ for evidences. If you cannot
   even dream of a good thing in yourselves, come to Jesus Christ as you
   did at the first. Come as if you never had come at all. Come to Jesus
   as a sinner, and your doubts shall flee away.

   "Ay!" saith another, "but my sins come to my remembrance, my sins since
   conversion." Well, return to Jesus, when your guilt seems to return.
   The fountain is still open, and that fountain, you will remember, is
   not only open for sinners, but for saints; for what saith the
   Scripture--"There shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and
   for the inhabitants of Jerusalem,"--that is, for you, church members,
   for you, believers in Jesus? The fountain is still open. Come, beloved,
   come to Jesus anew, and whatever be your sins, or doubts, or heaviness,
   they shall all depart as soon as you can touch your Lord.

   III. And now the last point is--and I will not detain you long upon
   it--if somebody shall touch Jesus, the Lord will know it.

   I do not know your names; a great number of you are perfect strangers
   to me. It matters nothing; your name is "somebody," and Christ will
   know you. You are a total stranger, perhaps, to everybody in this
   place; but if you get a blessing, there will be two who will know
   it,--you will, and Christ will. Oh! if you should look to Jesus this
   day, it may not be registered in our church-book, and we may not hear
   of it; but still it will be registered in the courts of heaven, and
   they will set all the bells of the New Jerusalem a-ringing, and all the
   harps of angels will take a fresh lease of music as soon as they know
   that you are born again.

   "With joy the Father doth approve

   The fruit of His eternal love;

   The Son with joy looks down and sees

   The purchase of His agonies;

   The Spirit takes delight to view

   The holy soul He formed anew;

   And saints and angels join to sing

   The growing empire of their King."

   "Somebody!" I do not know the woman's name; I do not know who the man
   is, but--"Somebody!"--God's electing love rests on thee, Christ's
   redeeming blood was shed for thee, the Spirit has wrought a work in
   thee, or thou wouldst not have touched Jesus; and all this Jesus knows.

   It is a consoling thought that Christ not only knows the great children
   in the family, but He also knows the little ones. This stands fast:
   "The Lord knoweth them that are His," whether they are only brought to
   know Him now, or whether they have known Him for fifty years. "The Lord
   knoweth them that are His," and if I am a part of Christ's body, I may
   be but the foot, but the Lord knows the foot; and the head and the
   heart in heaven feel acutely when the foot on earth is bruised. If you
   have touched Jesus, I tell you that amidst the glories of angels, and
   the everlasting hallelujahs of all the blood-bought, He has found time
   to hear your sigh, to receive your faith, and to give you an answer of
   peace. All the way from heaven to earth there has rushed a mighty
   stream of healing virtue, which has come from Christ to you. Since you
   have touched Him, the healing virtue has touched you.

   Now, as Jesus knows of your salvation, He wishes other people to know
   of it, and that is why He has put it into my heart to say,--Somebody
   has touched the Lord. Where is that somebody? Somebody, where are you?
   Somebody, where are you? You have touched Christ, though with a feeble
   finger, and you are saved. Let us know it. It is due to us to let us
   know. You cannot guess what joy it gives us when we hear of sick ones
   being healed by our Master. Some of you, perhaps, have known the Lord
   for months, and you have not yet come forward to make an avowal of it;
   we beg you to do so. You may come forward tremblingly, as this woman
   did; you may perhaps say, "I do not know what I should tell you." Well,
   you must tell us what she told the Lord; she told Him all the truth. We
   do not want anything else. We do not desire any sham experience. We do
   not want you to manufacture feelings like somebody else's that you have
   read of in a book. Come and tell us what you have felt. We shall not
   ask you to tell us what you have not felt, or what you do not know.
   But, if you have touched Christ, and you have been healed, I ask it,
   and I think I may ask it as your duty, as well as a favour to us, to
   come and tell us what the Lord hath done for your soul.

   And you, believers, when you come to the Lord's table, if you draw near
   to Christ, and have a sweet season, tell it to your brethren. Just as
   when Benjamin's brethren went down to Egypt to buy corn, they left
   Benjamin at home, but they took a sack for Benjamin, so you ought
   always to take a word home for the sick wife at home, or the child who
   cannot come out. Take home food for those of the family who cannot come
   for it. God grant that you may have always something sweet to tell of
   what you have experimentally known of precious truth, for while the
   sermon may have been sweet in itself, it comes with a double power when
   you can add, "and there was a savour about it which I enjoyed, and
   which made my heart leap for joy"!

   Whoever you may be, my dear friend, though you may be nothing but a
   poor "somebody," yet if you have touched Christ, tell others about it,
   in order that they may come and touch Him, too; and the Lord bless you,
   for Christ's sake! Amen.

 CHRIST AND HIS TABLE-COMPANIONS "And when the hour was come, He sat down, and
                 the twelve apostles with Him."--Luke xxii. 14.

CHRIST AND HIS TABLE-COMPANIONS.

   THE outward ordinances of the Christian religion are but two, and those
   two are exceedingly simple, yet neither of them has escaped human
   alteration; and, alas! much mischief has been wrought, and much of
   precious teaching has been sacrificed, by these miserable perversions.
   For instance, the ordinance of baptism as it was administered by the
   apostles betokened the burial of the believer with Christ, and his
   rising with his Lord into newness of life. Men must needs exchange
   immersion for sprinkling, and the intelligent believer for an
   unconscious child, and so the ordinance is slain. The other sacred
   institution, the Lord's supper, like believers' baptism, is simplicity
   itself. It consists of bread broken, and wine poured out, these viands
   being eaten and drunk at a festival--a delightful picture of the
   sufferings of Christ for us, and of the fellowship which the saints
   have with one another and with Him. But this ordinance, also, has been
   tampered with by men. By some, the wine has been taken away altogether,
   or reserved only for a priestly caste; and the simple bread has been
   changed into a consecrated host. As for the table, the very emblem of
   fellowship in all nations--for what expresses fellowship better than
   surrounding a table, and eating and drinking together?--this, forsooth,
   must be put away, and an altar must be erected, and the bread and wine
   which were to help us to remember the Lord Jesus are changed into an
   "unbloody sacrifice," and so the whole thing becomes an unscriptural
   celebration instead of a holy institution for fellowship. Let us be
   warned by these mistakes of others never either to add to or take from
   the Word of God so much as a single jot or tittle. Keep upon the
   foundation of the Scriptures, and you stand safely, and have an answer
   for those who question you; yea, and an answer which you may render at
   the bar of God; but once allow your own whim, or fancy, or taste, or
   your notion of what is proper and right, to rule you, instead of the
   Word of God, and you have entered upon a dangerous course, and unless
   the grace of God prevent, boundless mischief may ensue. The Bible is
   our standard authority; none may turn from it. The wise man says, in
   Ecclesiastes, "I counsel thee to keep the King's commandment;" we would
   repeat his advice, and add to it the sage precept of the mother of our
   Lord, at Cana, when she said, "Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it."

   We shall now ask you in contemplation to gaze upon the first
   celebration of the Lord's supper. You perceive at once that there was
   no altar in that large upper room. There was a table, a table with
   bread and wine upon it, but no altar; and Jesus did not kneel,--there
   is no sign of that,--but He sat down, I doubt not, after the Oriental
   mode of sitting, that is to say, by a partial reclining, He sat down
   with His apostles. Now, He who ordained this supper knew how it ought
   to be observed, and as the first celebration of it was the model for
   all others, we may be assured that the right way of coming to this
   communion is to assemble around a table, and to sit or recline while we
   eat and drink together of bread and wine in remembrance of our Lord.

   While we see the Saviour sitting down with His twelve apostles, let us
   enquire, first, what did this make them? Then, secondly, what did this
   imply? And, thirdly, what further may we legitimately infer from it?

   I. First, then, we see the Great Master, the Lord, the King in Zion,
   sitting down at the table to eat and drink with His twelve
   apostles,--what did this make them?

   Note what they were at first. By His first calling of them they became
   His followers, for He said unto them, "Follow Me." That is to say, they
   were convinced, by sundry marks and signs, that He was the Messias, and
   they, therefore, became His followers. Followers may be at a great
   distance from their leader, and enjoy little or no intercourse with
   him, for the leader may be too great to be approached by the common
   members of his band. In the case of the disciples, their following was
   unusually close, for their Master was very condescending, but still
   their intercourse was not always of the most intimate kind at first,
   and therefore it was not at the first that He called them to such a
   festival as this supper. They began with following, and this is where
   we must begin. If we cannot enter as yet into closer association with
   our Lord, we may, at least, know His voice by His Spirit, and follow
   Him as the sheep follow the shepherd. The most important way of
   following Him is to trust Him, and then diligently to imitate His
   example. This is a good beginning, and it will end well, for those who
   walk with Him to-day shall rest with Him hereafter; those who tread in
   His footsteps shall sit on His throne.

   Being His followers, they came next to be His disciples. A man may have
   been a follower for a while, and yet may not have reached discipleship.
   A follower may follow blindly, and hear a great deal which he does not
   understand; but when he becomes a disciple, his Master instructs him,
   and leads him into truth. To explain, to expound, to solve
   difficulties, to clear away doubts, and to make truth intelligible is
   the office of a teacher amongst his disciples. Now, it was a very
   blessed thing for the followers to become disciples, but still
   disciples are not necessarily so intimate with their Master as to sit
   and eat with him. Socrates and Plato knew many in the Academy whom they
   did not invite to their homes. My brethren, if Jesus had but called us
   to be His disciples, and no more we should have had cause for great
   thankfulness; if we had been allowed to sit at His feet, and had never
   shared in such an entertainment as that before us, we ought to have
   been profoundly grateful; but now that He has favoured us with a yet
   higher place, let us never be unfaithful to our discipleship. Let us
   daily learn of Jesus, let us search the Bible to see what it was that
   He taught us, and then by the aid of His Holy Spirit let us
   scrupulously obey. Yet is there a something beyond.

   Being the Lord's disciples, the chosen ones next rose to become His
   servants, which is a step in advance, since the disciple may be but a
   child, but the servant has some strength, has received some measure of
   training, and renders somewhat in return. Their Master gave them power
   to preach the gospel, and to execute commissions of grace, and happy
   were they to be called to wait upon such a Master, and aid in setting
   up His kingdom. My dear brethren and sisters, are you all Christ's
   servants consciously? If so, though the service may at times seem heavy
   because your faith is weak, yet be very thankful that you are servants
   at all, for it is better to serve God than to reign over all the
   kingdoms of this world. It is better to be the lowest servant of Christ
   than to be the greatest of men, and remain slaves to your own lusts, or
   be mere men-pleasers. His yoke is easy, and His burden is light. The
   servant of such a Master should rejoice in his calling; yet is there
   something beyond.

   Towards the close of His life, our Master revealed the yet nearer
   relation of His disciples, and uttered words like these: "Henceforth I
   call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth,
   but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of My
   Father I have made known unto you." This is a great step in advance.
   The friend, however humble, enjoys much familiarity with his friend.
   The friend is told what the servant need not know. The friend enjoys a
   communion to which the mere servant, disciple, or follower has not
   attained. May we know this higher association, this dearer bond of
   relationship! May we not be content without the enjoyment of our
   Master's friendship! "He that hath friends must show himself friendly;"
   and if we would have Christ's friendship, we must befriend His cause,
   His truth, and His people. He is a Friend that loveth at all times; if
   you would enjoy His friendship, take care to abide in Him.

   Now note that, on the night before His Passion, our Lord led His
   friends a step beyond ordinary friendship. The mere follower does not
   sit at table with his leader; the disciple does not claim to be a
   fellow-commoner with his master; the servant is seldom entertained at
   the same table with his lord; the befriended one is not always invited
   to be a guest; but here the Lord Jesus made His chosen ones to be His
   table-companions; He lifted them up to sit with Him at the same table,
   to eat of the same bread, and drink of the same cup with Himself. From
   that position He has never degraded them; they were representative men,
   and where the Lord placed them, He has placed all His saints
   permanently. All the Lord's believing people are sitting, by sacred
   privilege and calling, at the same table with Jesus, for truly, our
   fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. He has
   come into our hearts, and He sups with us, and we with Him; we are His
   table-companions, and shall eat bread with Him in the kingdom of God.

   Table-companions, then, that is the answer to the question, "What did
   this festival make the apostles?" This festival shows all the members
   of the Church of Christ to be, through divine grace, table-companions
   with one another, and with Christ Jesus their Lord.

   II. So now we shall pass on, in the second place, to ask, what did this
   table-companionship imply?

   It implied, first of all, mutual fidelity. This solemn eating and
   drinking together was a pledge of faithfulness to one another. It must
   have been so understood, or otherwise there would have been no force in
   the complaint: "He that eateth bread with Me hath lifted up his heel
   against Me." Did not this mean that, because Judas had eaten bread with
   his Lord, he was bound not to betray Him, and so to lift up his heel
   against Him? This was the seal of an implied covenant; having eaten
   together, they were under bond to be faithful to one another. Now, as
   many of you as are really the servants and friends of Christ may know
   that the Lord Jesus, in eating with you at His table, pledges Himself
   to be faithful to you. The Master never plays the Judas,--the Judas is
   among the disciples. There is nothing traitorous in the Lord; He is not
   only able to keep that which we have committed to Him, but He is
   faithful, and will do it. He will be faithful, not only as to the great
   and main matter, but also to every promise He has made. Know ye then,
   assuredly, that your Master would not have asked you to His table to
   eat bread with Him if He intended to desert you. He has received you as
   His honoured guests, and fed you upon His choicest meat, and thereby He
   does as good as say to you, "I will never leave you, come what may, and
   in all times of trial, and depression, and temptation, I will be at
   your right hand, and you shall not be moved, and to the very last you
   shall prove My faithfulness and truth."

   But, beloved, you do not understand this supper unless you are also
   reminded of the faithfulness that is due from you to your Lord, for the
   feast is common, and the pledge mutual. In eating with Him, you plight
   your troth to the Crucified, Beloved, how have you kept your pledge
   during the past year? You have eaten bread with Him, and I trust that
   in your hearts you have never gone so far aside as to lift up your heel
   against Him, but have you always honoured Him as you should? Have you
   acted as guests should have done? Can you remember His love to you, and
   put your love to Him side by side with it, without being ashamed? From
   this time forth, may the Holy Ghost work in our souls a jealous
   fidelity to the Well-beloved which shall not permit our hearts to
   wander from Him, or suffer our zeal for His glory to decline!

   Again, remember that there is in this solemn eating and drinking
   together a pledge of fidelity between the disciples themselves, as well
   as between the disciples and their Lord. Judas would have been a
   traitor if he had betrayed Peter, or John, or James: so, when ye come
   to the one table, my brethren, ye must henceforth be true to one
   another. All bickerings and jealousies must cease, and a generous and
   affectionate spirit must rule in every bosom. If you hear any speak
   against those you have communed with, reckon that, as you have eaten
   bread with them, you are bound to defend their reputations. If any
   railing accusation be raised against any brother in Christ, reckon that
   his character is as dear to you as your own. Let a sacred Freemasonry
   be maintained among us, if I may liken a far higher and more spiritual
   union to anything which belongs to common life. Ye are members one of
   another, see that ye love each other with a pure heart fervently.
   Drinking of the same cup, eating of the same bread, you set forth
   before the world a token which I trust is not meant to be a lie. As it
   truly shows Christ's faithfulness to you, so let it as really typify
   your faithfulness to Christ, and to one another.

   In the next place, eating and drinking together was a token of mutual
   confidence. They, in sitting there together, voluntarily avowed their
   confidence in each other. Those disciples trusted their Master, they
   knew He would not mislead or deceive them. They trusted each other
   also, for when they were told that one of them would betray their Lord,
   they did not suspect each other, but each one said, "Lord, is it I?"
   They had much confidence in one another, and the Lord Jesus, as we have
   seen, had placed great confidence in them by treating them as His
   friends. He had even trusted them with the great secret of His coming
   sufferings, and death. They were a trustful company who sat at that
   supper-table. Now, beloved, when you gather around this table, come in
   the spirit of implicit trustfulness in the Lord Jesus. If you are
   suffering, do not doubt His love, but believe that He works all things
   for your good. If you are vexed with cares, prove your confidence by
   leaving them entirely in your Redeemer's hands. It will not be a
   festival of communion to you if you come here with suspicions about
   your Master. No, show your confidence as you eat of the bread with Him.
   Let there also be a brotherly confidence in each other. Grievous would
   it be to see a spirit of suspicion and distrust among you. Suspicion is
   the death of fellowship. The moment one Christian imagines that another
   thinks hardly of him, though there may not be the slightest truth in
   that thought, yet straightway the root of bitterness is planted. Let us
   believe in one another's sincerity, for we may rest assured that each
   of our brethren deserves to be trusted more than we do. Turn your
   suspicions within, and if you must suspect, suspect your own heart; but
   when you meet with those who have communed with you at this table, say
   within yourself, "If such can deceive me, and alas I they may, then
   will I be content to be imposed upon rather than entertain perpetual
   mistrust of my fellow-Christians."

   A third meaning of the assembling around the table is this, hearty
   fraternity. Our Lord, in sitting down at the table with His disciples,
   showed Himself to be one with them, a Brother indeed. We do not read
   that there was any order of priority by which their seats were
   arranged. Of course, if the Grand Chamberlain at Rome had arranged the
   table, he would have placed Peter at the right hand of Christ, and the
   other apostles in graduated positions according to the dignity of their
   future bishoprics, but all that we know about their order is this, that
   John sat next to the Saviour, and leaned upon His bosom, and that Peter
   sat a good way off,--we feel sure he did, because it is said that he
   "beckoned" unto John; if he had sat next to him, he would have
   whispered to him, but he beckoned to him, and so he must have been some
   way down the table, if, indeed, there was any "down" or "up" in the
   arrangement of the guests. We believe the fact was, that they sat there
   on a sacred equality, the Lord Jesus, the EIder Brother, among them,
   and all else arranged according to those words, "One is your Master,
   even Christ, and all ye are brethren." Let us feel, then, in coming to
   the table again at this time, that we are linked in ties sacred
   relationship with Jesus Christ, who is exalted in heaven, and that
   through Him our relationship with our fellow-Christians is very near
   and intimate.

   Oh, that Christian brotherhood were more real! The very word "brother"
   has come to be ridiculed as a piece of hypocrisy, and well it may, for
   it is mostly used as a cant phrase, and in many cases means very
   little. But it ought to mean something. You have no right to come to
   that table unless you really feel that those who are washed in Jesus'
   blood have a claim upon the love of your heart, and the activity of
   your benevolence. What! are ye to live together for ever in heaven, and
   will ye show no affection for one another here below? It is your
   Master's new command that ye love one another; will ye disregard it? He
   has given this as the badge of Christians: "By this shall all men know
   that ye are My disciples,"--not if ye wear a gold cross, but--"if ye
   have love one to another." That is the Christian's badge of his being,
   in very truth, a disciple of Jesus Christ. Here, at this table, we find
   fraternity. Whosoever eateth of this sacred supper declares himself to
   be one of a brotherhood in Christ, a brotherhood striving for the same
   cause, having sincere sympathy, being members of each other, and all of
   them members of the body of Christ. God make this to be a fact
   throughout Christendom even now, and how will the world marvel as it
   cries, "See how these Christians love one another!"

   But this table means more yet: it signifies common enjoyment. Jesus
   eats, and they eat, the same bread. He drinks, and they drink, of the
   same cup. There is no distinction in the viands. What meaneth this?
   Doth it not say to us that the joy of Christ is the joy might remain in
   you, and that your joy might be full"? The very joy that delights
   Christ is that which He prepares for His people. You, if you are a true
   believer, have sympathy in Christ's joy, you delight to see His kingdom
   come, the truth advanced, sinners saved, grace glorified, holiness
   promoted, God exalted; this also is His delight. But my dear brethren
   and fellow-professors, are you sure that your chief joy is the same as
   Christ's? Are you certain that the mainstay of your life is the same as
   that which was His meat and His drink, namely, to do the will of the
   heavenly Father? If not, I am afraid you have no business at this
   table; but if it be so, and you come to the table, then I pray that you
   may share the joy of Christ. May you joy in Him as He joys in you, and
   so may your fellowship be sweet!

   Lastly, on this point, the feast at the one table indicated familiar
   affection. It is the child's place to sit at the table with its
   parents, for there affection rules. It is the place of honour to sit at
   the table: "Martha served, but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the
   table." But the honour is such as love and not fear suggests. Men at
   the table often reveal their minds more fully than elsewhere. If you
   want to understand a man, you do not go to see him at the Stock
   Exchange, or follow him into the market; for there he keeps himself to
   himself; but you go to his table, and there he unbosoms himself. Now,
   the Lord Jesus Christ sat at the table with His disciples. Twas a meal;
   twas a meal of a homely kind; intimate intercourse ruled the hour. Oh,
   brethren and sisters, I am afraid we have come to this table sometimes,
   and Christ, and then it has been an empty formality and nothing more. I
   thank God that, coming to this table every Sabbath-day, as some of us
   do, and have done for many years, we have yet for the most part enjoyed
   the nearest communion with Christ here that we have ever known, and
   have a thousand times blessed His name for this ordinance. Still, there
   is such a thing as only eating the bread and drinking the wine, and
   losing all the sacred meaning thereof. Do pray the Lord to reveal
   Himself to you. Ask that it may not be a dead form to you, but that now
   in very deed you may give to Christ your heart, while He shall show to
   you His hands and His side, and make known to you His agonies and
   death, wherewith He redeemed you from the wrath to come. All this, and
   vastly more, is the teaching of the table at which Jesus sat with the
   twelve. I have often wondered why the Church of Rome does not buy up
   all those pictures by one of its most renowned painters, Leonardo da
   Vinci, in which our Lord is represented as sitting at the table with
   His disciples, for these are a contradiction of the Popish doctrine on
   this subject. As long as that picture remains on the wall, and as long
   as copies of it are spread everywhere, the Church of Rome stands
   convicted of going against the teaching of the earlier Church by
   setting up an altar when she confesses herself that aforetime it was
   not considered to be an altar of sacrifice but a table of fellowship,
   at which the Lord did not kneel, nor stand as an officiating priest,
   but at which He and His disciples sat. We, at least, have no rebukes to
   fear from antiquity, for we follow, and mean to follow, the primitive
   method. Our Lord has given us commandment to do this until He
   comes,--not to alter it, but just to "do this," and nothing else, in
   the same manner until He shall come.

   III. We will draw to a close by asking--What further may be inferred
   from this sitting of Christ with his disciples at the table?

   I answer: first, there may be inferred from it the equality of all the
   saints. There were here twelve apostles. Their apostleship, however, is
   not concerned in the matter. When the Lord's supper was celebrated
   after all the apostles had gone to heaven, was there to be any
   alteration because the apostles had gone? Not at all. Believers are to
   do this in remembrance of their Lord until He shall come. There was no
   command for a change when the first apostles were all gone from the
   Church: No, it was to be the same still,--bread and wine and the
   surrounding of the table, until the Lord came. I gather, then, the
   equality of all saints. There is a difference in office, there was a
   difference in miraculous gift, and there are great differences in
   growth of grace; but still, in the household of God, all saints,
   whether apostles, pastors, teachers, deacons, elders, or private
   members, being all equal, eat at one table. There is but one bread,
   there is but one juice of the vine here.

   It is only in the Church of God that those words, so wild politically,
   can ever be any more than a dream, "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity."
   There you have them, where Jesus is; not in a republic, but in the
   kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, where all rule and
   dominion are vested in Him, and all of us willingly acknowledge Him as
   our glorious Head, and all we are brethren. Never fall into the idea
   that older believers were of a superior nature to ourselves. Do not
   talk of Saint Paul, and Saint Matthew, and Saint Mark, unless you are
   prepared to speak of Saint William and Saint Jane sitting over yonder,
   for if they be in Christ they are as truly saints as those first saints
   were, and I ween there may be some who have attained even to higher
   saintship than many whom tradition has canonized. The heights of
   saintship are by grace open to us all, and the Lord invites us to
   ascend. Do not think that what the Lord wrought in the early saints
   cannot be wrought in you. It is because you think so that you do not
   pray for it, and because you do not pray for it you do not attain it.
   The grace of God sustained the apostles; that grace is not less to-day
   than it was then. The Lord's arm is not shortened; His power is not
   straitened. If we can but believe, and be as earnest as those first
   saints were, we shall subdue kingdoms yet, and the day shall come when
   the gods of Hinduism, and the falsehoods of Mohammed, and the lies of
   Rome, shall as certainly be overthrown as were the ancient philosophies
   and the classic idolatries of Greece and Rome by the teaching of the
   first ministers of Christ. There is the same table for you, and the
   same food is there in emblem, and grace can make you like those holy
   men, for you are bought with the same blood, and quickened by the same
   Spirit. Believe only, for all things are possible to him that
   believeth.

   Another inference, only to be hinted at, is this, that the wants of the
   Church in all ages will be the same, and the supplies for the Church's
   wants will never vary. There will be the table still, and the table
   with the same viands upon it,--bread still, nothing more than bread for
   food; wine still, nothing less than wine for drink. The Church will
   always want the same food, the same Christ, the same gospel. Out on ye,
   traitors, who tell us that we are to shape our gospel to suit this
   enlightened nineteenth century! Out on ye, false-hearts, who would have
   us tone down the everlasting truth that shall outlive the sun, and
   moon, and stars, to suit your boasted culture, which is but varnished
   ignorance! No, that truth which of old was mighty through God to the
   pulling down of strongholds is mighty still, and we will maintain it to
   the death; the Church wants the doctrines of grace to-day as much as
   when Paul, or Augustine, or Calvin preached them; the Church wants
   justification by faith, the substitutionary atonement, and
   regeneration, and divine sovereignty to be preached from her pulpits as
   much as in days of yore, and by God's grace she shall have them, too.

   Lastly, there is in this truth, that Christ has brought all His
   disciples into the position of table-companions, a prophecy that this
   shall be the portion of all His people for ever. In heaven there cannot
   be less of privilege than on earth. It cannot be that in the celestial
   state believers will be degraded from what they have been below. What
   were they, then, below? Table-companions. What shall they be in heaven
   above? Table-companions still, and blessed is he that shall eat bread
   in the kingdom of God. "Many shall come from the east and from the
   west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the
   kingdom of God," and the Lord Jesus shall be at the head of the table.
   Now, what will His table of joy be? Set your imagination to work, and
   think what will be His festival of soul when His reward shall be all
   before Him, and His triumph all achieved. Have ye imagined it? Can ye
   conceive it? Whatever it is, you shall share in it. I repeat those
   words, whatever it is, the least believer shall share in it. You, poor
   working-woman, oh, what a change for you, to sit among princes, near to
   your Lord Jesus, all your toil and want forever ended! And you, sad
   child of suffering, scarcely able to come up to the assembly of God's
   people, and going back, perhaps, to that bed of languishing again, you
   shall have no pains there, but you shall be forever with the Lord, and
   the joy of Christ shall be your joy forever and ever! Oh, can you not
   realize those words of Dr. Watts,--

   "Yes, and before we rise

   To that immortal state,

   The thoughts of such amazing bliss

   Should constant joys create"?

   In the anticipation of the joy that shall be yours, forget your present
   troubles, rise superior to the difficulties of the hour, and if you
   cannot rejoice in the present, yet rejoice in the future, which shall
   so soon be your own.

   We finish with this word of deep regret,--regret that many here cannot
   understand what we have been talking about, and have no part in it.
   There are some of you who must not come to the table of communion
   because you do not love Christ. You have not trusted Him; you have no
   part in Him. There is no salvation in sacraments. Believe me, they are
   but delusions to those who do not come to Christ with their heart. You
   must not come to the outward sign if you have not the thing signified.
   Here is the way of Salvation: believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   thou shalt be saved. To believe in Him is to trust Him; to use an old
   word, it is recumbency; it is leaning on Him, resting on Him. Here I
   lean, I rest my whole weight on this support before me; do so with
   Christ in a spiritual sense: lean on Him. You have a load of sin, lean
   on Him, sin and all. You are all unworthy, and weak, and perhaps
   miserable; then cast on Him the weakness, the unworthiness, the misery
   and all. Take Him to be all in all to you, and when you have thus
   trusted Him, you will have become His follower; go on by humility to be
   His disciple, by obedience to be His servant, by love to be His friend,
   and by communion to be His table-companion.

   The Lord so lead you, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

    A WORD FROM THE BELOVED'S OWN MOUTH. "And ye are clean."--John xiii. 10.

A WORD FROM THE BELOVED'S OWN MOUTH.

   AS Gideon's fleece was full of dew so that he could wring out the
   moisture, so will a text sometimes be when the Holy Spirit deigns to
   visit His servants through its words. This utterance of our Saviour to
   His disciples has been as a wafer made with honey to our taste, and we
   doubt not it may prove equally as sweet to others.

   Observe carefully, dear friends, what the eulogium is which is here
   passed upon the Lord's beloved disciples: "Ye are clean." This is the
   primeval blessing, so soon lost by our first parents. This is the
   virtue, the loss of which shut man out of Paradise, and continues to
   shut men out of heaven. The want of cleanness in heart and hands
   condemns sinners to banishment from God, and defiles all their
   offerings. To be clean before God is the desire of every penitent, and
   the highest aspiration of the most advanced believer. It is what all
   the ceremonies and ablutions of the law can never bestow and what
   Pharisees with all their pretensions cannot attain. To be clean is to
   be as the angels are, as glorified saints are, yea, as the Father
   Himself is.

   Acceptance with the Lord, safety, happiness, and every blessing, always
   go with cleanness of heart, and he that hath it cannot miss of heaven.
   It seems too high a condition to be ascribed to mortals, yet, by the
   lips of Him who could not err, the disciples were said, without a
   qualifying word, or adverb of degree, to be "clean"; that is to say,
   they were perfectly justified in the sight of eternal equity, and were
   regarded as free from every impurity. Dear friends, is this blessing
   yours? Have you ever believed unto righteousness? Have you taken the
   Lord Jesus to be your complete cleansing, your sanctification, your
   redemption? Has the Holy Spirit ever sealed in your peaceful spirit the
   gracious testimony, "ye are clean"? The assurance is not confined to
   the apostles, for ye also are "complete in Him," "perfect in Christ
   Jesus," if ye have indeed by faith received the righteousness of God.
   The psalmist said, "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow;" if you
   have been washed, you are even to that highest and purest degree clean
   before the Lord, and clean now. Oh, that all believers would live up to
   their condition and privilege; but alas! too many are pining as if they
   were still miserable sinners, and forgetting that they are in Christ
   Jesus forgiven sinners, and therefore ought to be happy in the Lord.
   Remember, beloved believer, that, as one with Christ, you are not with
   sinners in the gall of bitterness, but with the saints in the land
   which floweth with milk and honey.

   Your cleanness is not a thing of degrees, it is not a variable or
   vanishing quantity, it is present, abiding, perfect, you are clean
   through the Word, through the application of the blood of sprinkling to
   the conscience, and through the imputation of the righteousness of the
   Lord Jesus Christ. Then lift up your head, and sing for joy of heart,
   seeing that your transgression is pardoned, your sin is covered, and in
   you Jehovah seeth not iniquity. Dear friends, let not another moment
   pass till by faith in Jesus you have grasped this privilege. Be not
   content to believe that the priceless boon may be had, but lay hold
   upon it for yourself. You will find the song of substitution a choice
   song if you are able to sing it.

   "In my Surety I am free,

   His dear hands were pierced for me;

   With his spotless vesture on

   Holy as the Holy One."

   Much of the force of the sentence before us lies in the Person
   praising. To be certified as clean by the blind priests of Rome, would
   be small comfort to a true Christian. To receive the approving verdict
   of our fellow-men is consoling, but it is after all of small
   consequence. The human standard of purity is itself grossly incorrect,
   and therefore to be judged by it is but a poor trial, and to be
   acquitted a slender comfort; but the Lord Jesus judges no man after the
   flesh, He came forth from God, and is Himself God, infinitely just and
   good, hence His tests are accurate, and His verdict is absolute. I wot
   whom He pronounces clean is clean indeed. Our Lord was omniscient, He
   would have at once detected the least evil in His disciples; if there
   had remained upon the man unpardoned sin, He must have seen it; if any
   relic of condemnation had lingered upon them, He must have detected it
   at once, no speck could have escaped His all-discerning eye; yet did He
   say without hesitation of all but Judas, "Ye are clean."

   Perhaps they did not catch the full glory of this utterance; possibly
   they missed much of that deep joyous meaning, which is now revealed to
   us by the Spirit; otherwise, what bliss to have heard with their own
   ears from those sacred lips, so plain, so positive, so sure a testimony
   to their character before God! Yet our hearts need not be filled with
   regret because we cannot hear that ever-blessed voice with these our
   earthly ears, for the testimony of Jesus in the Word is quite as sure
   as the witness of His lips when He spoke among the sons of men, and
   that testimony is, "Whosoever believeth is justified from all things."
   Yes, it is as certain as if you, dear friends, heard the Redeemer
   Himself speak, that you are free from all condemning sin if you are
   looking with your whole heart to Jesus only as your all in all. What a
   joy is yours and mine! He who is to judge the world in righteousness
   has Himself affirmed us to be clean. By how much the condemnation of
   guilt is black and terrible, by so much the forgiveness of sin is
   bright and comforting. Let us rejoice in the Lord, whose indisputable
   judgment has given forth a sentence so joyous, so full of glory.

   "Jesus declares me clean,

   Then clean indeed I am,

   However guilty I have been,

   I'm cleans'd through the Lamb.

   "His lips can never lie,

   His eye is never blind,

   If he acquit, I can defy

   All hell a fault to find."

   It may cheer us to call to mind the persons praised. They were not
   cherubim and seraphim, but men, and notably they were men compassed
   with infirmity. There was Peter, who a few minutes after was forward
   and presumptuous; and, indeed, it is not needful to name them one by
   one, for they all forsook their Master, and fled in His hour of peril.
   Not one among them was more than a mere child in grace; they had little
   about them that was apostolic except their commission, they were very
   evidently men of like passions with us; yet their Lord declared them to
   be clean, and clean they were. Here is good cheer for those souls who
   are hungering after righteousness, and pining because they feel so much
   of the burden of indwelling sin; for cleanliness before the Lord is not
   destroyed by our infirmities, nor prevented by our inward temptations.
   We stand in the righteousness of Another. No measure of personal
   weakness, spiritual anxiety, soul conflict, or mental agony can mar our
   acceptance in the Beloved. We may be weak infants, or wandering sheep
   in ourselves, and for both reasons we may be very far from what we wish
   to be; but, as God sees us, we are viewed as washed in the blood of
   Jesus, and we, even we, are clean every whit.

   What a forcible expression, "clean every whit;" every inch, from every
   point of view, in all respects, and to the uttermost degree! Dear
   friend, if a believer, this fact is true to you, even to you. Hesitate
   not to drink, for it is water out of your own cistern, given to you in
   the covenant of grace. Think not that it is presumption to believe the
   Word, marvellous though it be. You are dealing with a wonderful
   Saviour, who only doeth wonderful things, therefore stand not back on
   account of the greatness of the blessing, but rather believe the more
   readily because the Word is so like to everything the Lord doeth or
   speaketh. Yet when thou hast believed for thyself, and cast every doubt
   to the wind, thou wilt not wonder less, but more, and it will be thy
   never-ceasing cry, "Whence is this to me?" How is it that I, who
   wallowed with swine, should be made pure as the angels? Delivered from
   the foulest guilt, is it indeed possible that I am made the possessor
   of a perfect righteousness? Sing, O heavens, for the Lord hath done it,
   and He shall have everlasting praise!

   "Yes, thou, my soul, e'en thou art clean,

   The Lord has wash'd thee white as snow,

   In spotless beauty thou art seen,

   And Jesus hath pronounced thee so.

   "Despite thy conflicts, doubts, and fears,

   Yet art thou still in Christ all fair,

   Haste then to wipe away thy tears,

   And make His glory all thy care."

   The time when the praise was given is not without instruction. The word
   of loving judgment is in the present tense, "Ye are clean." It is not,
   "ye were clean," that might be a rebuke for purity shamelessly sullied,
   a condemnation for wilful neglect, a prophecy of wrath to come; neither
   is it, "ye might have been clean," that would have been a stern rebuke
   for privileges rejected, and opportunities wasted; nor is it even, "ye
   shall be clean," though that would have been a delightful prophecy of
   good things to come at some distant period; but ye are clean, at this
   moment, in this room, and around this table. Though but just then Peter
   had spoken so rudely, yet he was even then clean.

   What comfort is here amid our present sense of imperfection! Our
   cleanness is a matter of this present hour, we are, just here in our
   present condition and our position, "clean every whit." Why then
   postpone joy? The cause of it is in possession, let the mirth be even
   now overflowing. Much of our heritage is certainly future, but if there
   were no other boon tangible to faith in this immediate present, this
   one blessing alone should awaken all our powers to the highest praise.
   Are we even now clothed with the fair white linen which is the
   righteousness of saints? Yes, tis even so, for--

   "We are wash'd in Jesu's blood,

   We're pardon'd through His name;

   And the good Spirit of our God

   Has sanctified our frame."

   Then let us sing a new song unto Jehovah-Tsidkenu, the Lord our
   Righteousness.

   May the Holy Ghost now bear witness with every believer, "and ye are
   clean."

   "Then may your souls rejoice and sing,

   Then may your voices sweetly ring,

   For if your souls through Christ are clear,

   What cause have you to faint or fear?"

 THE BELIEVER NOT AN ORPHAN. "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to
                              you."--John xiv. 18.

THE BELIEVER NOT AN ORPHAN.

   YOU will notice that the margin reads, "I will not leave you orphans: I
   will come to you." In the absence of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   disciples were like children deprived of their parents. During the
   three years in which He had been with them, He had solved all their
   difficulties, borne all their burdens, and supplied all their needs.
   Whenever a case was too hard or too heavy for them, they took it to
   Him. When their enemies well nigh overcame them, Jesus came to the
   rescue, and turned the tide of battle. They were all happy and safe
   enough whilst the Master was with them; He walked in their midst like a
   father amid a large family of children, making all the household glad.
   But now He was about to be taken from them by an ignominious death, and
   they might well feel that they would be like little children deprived
   of their natural and beloved protector. Our Saviour knew the fear that
   was in their hearts, and before they could express it, He removed it by
   saying, "You shall not be left alone in this wild and desert world;
   though I be absent in the flesh, yet I will be present with you in a
   more efficacious manner; I will come to you spiritually, and you shall
   derive from My spiritual presence even more good than you could have
   had from My bodily presence, had I still continued in your midst."

   Observe, first, here is an evil averted: "I will not leave you
   orphans;" and, in the second place, here is a consolation provided: "I
   will come to you."

   I. First, here is, an evil averted.

   Without their Lord, believers would, apart from the Holy Spirit, be
   like other orphans, unhappy and desolate. Give them what you might,
   their loss could not have been recompensed. No number of lamps can make
   up for the sun's absence; blaze as they may, it is still night. No
   circle of friends can supply to a bereaved woman the loss of her
   husband; without him, she is still a widow. Even thus, without Jesus,
   it is inevitable that the saints should be as orphans; but Jesus has
   promised in the text that we shall not be so; the one only thing that
   can remove the trial He declares shall be ours, "I will come to you."

   Now remember, that an orphan is one whose parent is dead. This in
   itself is a great sorrow, if there were no other. The dear father, so
   well beloved, was suddenly smitten down with sickness; they watched him
   with anxiety; they nursed him with sedulous care; but he expired. The
   loving eye is closed in darkness for them. That active hand will no
   longer toil for the family. That heart and brain will no longer feel
   and think for them. Beneath the green grass the father sleeps, and
   every time the child surveys that hollowed hillock his heart swells
   with grief. Beloved, we are not orphans in that sense, for our Lord
   Jesus is not dead. It is true He died, for one of the soldiers with a
   spear pierced His side, and forthwith came thereout blood and water, a
   sure evidence that the pericardium had been pierced, and that the
   fountain of life had been broken up. He died, tis certain, but He is
   not dead now. Go not to the grave to seek Him. Angel voices say, "He is
   not here, for He is risen." He could not be holden by the bands of
   death. We do not worship a dead Christ, nor do we even think of Him now
   as a corpse. That picture on the wall, which the Romanists paint and
   worship, represents Christ as dead; but oh! it is so good to think of
   Christ as living, remaining in an existence real and true, none the
   less living because He died, but all the more truly full of life
   because He has passed through the portals of the grave, and is now
   reigning for ever. See then, dear friends, the bitter root of the
   orphan's sorrow is gone from us, for our Jesus is not dead now. No
   mausoleum enshrines His ashes, no pyramid entombs His body, no monument
   records the place of His permanent sepulchre.

   "He lives, the great Redeemer lives,

   What joy the blest assurance gives!"

   We are not orphans, for "the Lord is risen indeed."

   The orphan has a sharp sorrow springing out of the death of his parent,
   namely, that he is left alone. He cannot now make appeals to the wisdom
   of the parent who could direct him. He cannot run, as once he did, when
   he was weary, to climb the paternal knee. He cannot lean his aching
   head upon the parental bosom. "Father," he may say, but no voice gives
   an answer. "Mother," he may cry, but that fond title, which would
   awaken the mother if she slept, cannot arouse her from the bed of
   death. The child is alone, alone as to those two hearts which were its
   best companions. The parent and lover are gone. The little ones know
   what it is to be deserted and forsaken. But we are not so; we are not
   orphans. It is true Jesus is not here in body, but His spiritual
   presence is quite as blessed as His bodily presence would have been.
   Nay, it is better, for supposing Jesus Christ to be here in person, you
   could not all come and touch the hem of His garment,--not all at once,
   at any rate. There might be thousands waiting all the world over to
   speak with Him; but how could they all reach Him, if He were merely
   here in body? You might all be wanting to tell Him something, but in
   the body He could only receive some one or two of you at a time.

   But in spirit there is no need for you to stir from the pew, no need to
   say a word; Jesus hears your thoughts talk, and attends to all your
   needs at the same moment. No need to press to get at Him because the
   throng is great, for He is as near to me as He is to you, and as near
   to you as to saints in America, or the islands of the Southern Sea. He
   is everywhere present, and all His beloved may talk with Him. You can
   tell Him at this moment the sorrows which you dare not open up to
   anyone else. You will feel that, in declaring them to Him, you have not
   breathed them to the air, but that a real Person has heard you, One as
   real as though you could grip His hand, and could see the loving flash
   of His eye and mark the sympathetic change of His countenance.

   Is it not so with you, ye children of a living Saviour? You know it is;
   you have a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother. You have a near
   and dear One, who, in the dead of the night is in the chamber, and in
   the heat and burden of the day is in the field of labour. You are not
   orphans, the "Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the Everlasting
   Father, the Prince of Peace," is with you; your Lord is here; and, as
   one whom his mother comforteth, so Jesus comforts you.

   The orphan, too, has lost the kind hand which took care always that
   food and raiment should be provided, that the table should be well
   stored, and that the house should be kept in comfort. Poor feeble one,
   who will provide for his wants? His father is dead, his mother is gone:
   who will take care of the little wanderer now? But it is not so with
   us. Jesus has not left us orphans; His care for His people is no less
   now than it was when He sat at the table with Mary, and Martha, and
   Lazarus, whom "Jesus loved." Instead of the provisions being less, they
   are even greater, for since the Holy Spirit has been given to us, we
   have richer fare and are more indulged with spiritual comforts than
   believers were before the bodily presence of the Master had departed.
   Do your souls hunger to-night? Jesus gives you the bread of heaven. Do
   you thirst to-night? The waters from the rock cease not to flow.

   "Come, make your wants, your burdens known."

   You have but to make known your needs to have them all supplied, Christ
   waits to be gracious in the midst of this assembly. He is here with His
   golden hand, opening that hand to supply the wants of every living
   soul. "Oh!" saith one, "I am poor and needy." Go on with the quotation.
   "Yet the Lord thinketh upon me." "Ah" saith another, "I have besought
   the Lord thrice to take away a thorn in the flesh from me." Remember
   what he said to Paul, "My grace is sufficient for thee." You are not
   left without the strength you want. The Lord is your Shepherd still. He
   will provide for you till He leads you through death's dark valley, and
   brings you to the shining pastures upon the hill-tops of glory. You are
   not destitute, you need not beg an asylum from an ungodly world by
   bowing to its demands, or trusting its vain promises, for Jesus will
   never leave you nor forsake you.

   The orphan, too, is left without the instruction which is most suitable
   for a child. We may say what we will, but there is none so fit to form
   a child's character as the parent. It is a very sad loss for a child to
   have lost either father or mother in its early days; for the most
   skilful preceptor, though he may do much, by the blessing of God very
   much, is but a stop-gap, and but half makes up for the original
   ordinance of Providence, that the parent's love should fashion the
   child's mind. But, dear friends, we are not orphans; we who believe in
   Jesus are not left without an education. Jesus is not here Himself, it
   is true. I dare say some of you wish you could come on Lord's-days, and
   listen to Him! Would it not be sweet to look up to this pulpit, and see
   the Crucified One, and to hear Him preach? Ah! so you think, but the
   apostle says, "Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now
   henceforth know we Him no more."

   It is most for your profit that you should receive the Spirit of truth,
   not through the golden vessel of Christ in His actual presence here,
   but through the poor earthen vessels of humble servants of God like
   ourselves. At any rate, whether we speak, or an angel from heaven, the
   speaker matters not; it is the Spirit of God alone that is the power of
   the Word, and makes that Word to become vital and quickening to you.
   Now, you have the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is so given, that
   there is not a truth which you may not understand. You may be led into
   the deepest mysteries by His teaching. You may be made to know and to
   comprehend those knotty points in the Word of God which have hitherto
   puzzled you. You have but humbly to look up to Jesus, and His Spirit
   will still teach you. I tell you, though you are poor and ignorant, and
   perhaps can scarcely read a word in the Bible; for all that, you may be
   better instructed in the things of God than doctors of divinity, if you
   go to the Holy Spirit, and are taught of Him. Those who go only to
   books and to the letter, and are taught of men, may be fools in the
   sight of God; but those who go to Jesus, and sit at His feet, and ask
   to be taught of His Spirit, shall be wise unto salvation. Blessed be
   God, there are not a few amongst us of this sort. We are not left
   orphans; we have an Instructor with us still.

   There is one point in which the orphan is often sorrowfully reminded of
   his orphanhood, namely, in lacking a defender. It is so natural in
   little children, when some big boy molests them, to say, "I'll tell my
   father!" How often did we use to say so, and how often have we heard
   from the little ones since, "I'll tell mother!" Sometimes, the not
   being able to do this is a much severer loss than we can guess. Unkind
   and cruel men have snatched away from orphans the little which a
   father's love had left behind; and in the court of law there has been
   no defender to protect the orphan's goods. Had the father been there,
   the child would have had its rights, scarcely would any have dared to
   infringe them; but, in the absence of the father, the orphan is eaten
   up like bread, and the wicked of the earth devour his estate. In this
   sense, the saints are not orphans. The devil would rob us of our
   heritage if he could, but there is an Advocate with the Father who
   pleads for us. Satan would snatch from us every promise, and tear from
   us all the comforts of the covenant; but we are not orphans, and when
   he brings a suit-at-law against us, and thinks that we are the only
   defendants in the case, he is mistaken, for we have an Advocate on
   high. Christ comes in and pleads, as the sinners' Friend, for us; and
   when He pleads at the bar of justice, there is no fear but that His
   plea will be of effect, and our inheritance shall be safe. He has not
   left us orphans.

   Now I want, without saying many words, to get you who love the Master
   to feel what a very precious thought this is, that you are not alone in
   this world; that, if you have no earthly friends, if you have none to
   whom you can take your cares, if you are quite lonely so far as outward
   friends are concerned, yet Jesus is with you, is really with you,
   practically with you, able to help you, and ready to do so, and that
   you have a good and kind Protector close at hand at this present
   moment, for Christ has said it: "I will not leave you orphans."

   II. Secondly, there is, a consolation provided: The remedy by which the
   evil is averted is this, our Lord Jesus said, "I will come to you."

   What does this mean? Does it not mean, from the connection, this--"I
   will come to you by My Spirit"? Beloved, we must not confuse the
   Persons of the Godhead. The Holy Spirit is not the Son of God; Jesus,
   the Son of God, is not the Holy Spirit.

   They are two distinct Persons of the one Godhead. But yet there is such
   a wonderful unity, and the blessed Spirit acts so marvellously as the
   Vicar of Christ, that it is quite correct to say that, when the Spirit
   comes, Jesus comes, too, and "I will come to you," means "I, by My
   Spirit, who shall take My place, and represent Me, I will come to be
   with you." See then, Christian, you have the Holy Spirit in you and
   with you to be the Representative of Christ. Christ is with you now,
   not in person, but by His Representative,--an efficient, almighty,
   divine, everlasting Representative, who stands for Christ, and is as
   Christ to you in His presence in your souls. Because you thus have
   Christ by His Spirit, you cannot be orphans, for the Spirit of God is
   always with you. It is a delightful truth that the Spirit of God always
   dwells in believers;--not sometimes, but always. He is not always
   active in believers, and He may be grieved until His sensible presence
   is altogether withdrawn, but His secret presence is always there. At no
   single moment is the Spirit of God wholly gone from a believer. The
   believer would die spiritually if this could happen, but that cannot
   be, for Jesus has said, "Because I live, ye shall live also." Even when
   the believer sins, the Holy Spirit does not utterly depart from him,
   but is still in him to make him smart for the sin into which he has
   fallen. The believer's prayers prove that the Holy Spirit is still
   within him. "Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me," was the prayer of a
   saint who had fallen very foully, but in whom the Spirit of God still
   kept His residence, notwithstanding all the foulness of his guilt and
   sin.

   But, beloved, in addition to this, Jesus Christ by His Spirit makes
   visits to His people of a peculiar kind. The Holy Ghost becomes
   wonderfully active and potent at certain times of refreshing. We are
   then especially and joyfully sensible of His divine power. His
   influence streams through every chamber of our nature, and floods our
   dark soul with His glorious rays, as the sun shining in its strength.
   Oh, how delightful this is! Sometimes we have felt this at the Lord's
   table. My soul pants to sit with you at that table, because I do
   remember many a happy time when the emblems of bread and wine have
   assisted my faith, and kindled the passions of my soul into a heavenly
   flame. I am equally sure that, at the prayer-meeting, under the
   preaching of the Word, in private meditation, and in searching the
   Scriptures, we can say that Jesus Christ has come to us. What! have you
   no hill Mizar to remember?--

   "No Tabor-visits to recount,

   When with Him in the Holy Mount"?

   Oh, yes! some of these blessed seasons have left their impress upon our
   memories, so that, amongst our dying thoughts, will mingle the
   remembrance of those blessed seasons when Jesus Christ manifested
   Himself unto us as He doth not unto the world. Oh, to be wrapped in
   that crimson vest, closely pressed to His open side!' Oh, to put our
   finger into the print of nails, and thrust our hand into His side! We
   know what this means by past experience.

   "Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,

   Thy former mercies here renew."

   Permit us once again to feel the truth of the promise, "I will not
   leave you orphans; I will come to you." And now, gathering up the few
   thoughts I have uttered, let me remind you, dear friends, that every
   word of the text is instructive: "I will not leave you orphans: I will
   come to you." Observe the "I" there twice over. "I will not leave you
   orphans; father and mother may, but I will not; friends once beloved
   may turn stony-hearted, but I will not; Judas may play the traitor, and
   Ahithophel may betray his David, but I will not leave you comfortless.
   You have had many disappointments, great heart-breaking sorrows, but I
   have never caused you any; I--the faithful and the true Witness, the
   immutable, the unchangeable Jesus, the same yesterday, to-day, and for
   ever, I will not leave you comfortless; I will come unto you." Catch at
   that word, "I," and let your souls say, "Lord, I am not worthy that
   Thou shouldest come under my roof; if Thou hadst said, I will send an
   angel to thee,' it would have been a great mercy, but what sayest Thou,
   I will come unto thee'? If Thou hadst bidden some of my brethren come
   and speak a word of comfort to me, I had been thankful, but Thou hast
   put it thus in the first person, I will come unto you.' O my Lord, what
   shall I say, what shall I do, but feel a hungering and a thirsting
   after Thee, which nothing shall satisfy till Thou shalt fulfil Thine
   own Word, I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you'"?

   And then notice the persons to whom it is addressed, "I will not leave
   you comfortless, you, Peter, who will deny Me; you, Thomas, who will
   doubt Me; I will not leave you comfortless." O you who are so little in
   Israel that you sometimes think it is a pity that your name is in the
   church-book at all, because you feel yourselves to be so worthless, so
   unworthy, He will not leave you comfortless, not even you! "O Lord,"
   thou sayest, "if Thou wouldst look after the rest of Thy sheep, I would
   bless Thee for Thy tenderness to them, but I--I deserve to be left; if
   I were forsaken of Thee, I could not blame Thee, for I have played the
   harlot against Thy love, but yet Thou sayest, I will not leave you.'"
   Heir of heaven, do not lose your part in this promise. I pray you say,
   "Lord, come unto me, and though Thou refresh all my brethren, yet,
   Lord, refresh me with some of the droppings of Thy love; O Lord, fill
   the cup for me; my thirsty spirit pants for it.

   "I thirst, I faint, I die to prove

   The greatness of redeeming love,

   The love of Christ to me.'

   Now, Lord, fulfil Thy word to Thine unworthy handmaid, as I stand like
   Hannah in Thy presence. Come unto me, Thy servant, unworthy to lift so
   much as his eyes towards heaven, and only daring to say, God be
   merciful to me a sinner.' Fulfil Thy promise even to me, I will not
   leave you comfortless; I will come to you.'"

   Take whichever of the words you will, and they each one sparkle and
   flash after this sort. Observe, too, the richness and sufficiency of
   the text: "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you." He
   does not promise, "I will send you sanctifying grace, or sustaining
   mercy, or precious mercy," but He says, what is the only thing that
   will prevent your being orphans, "I will come to you." Ah! Lord, Thy
   grace is sweet, but Thou art better. The vine is good, but the clusters
   are better. It is well enough to have a gift from Thy hand, but oh! to
   touch the hand itself. It is well enough to hear the words of Thy lips,
   but oh! to kiss those lips as the spouse did in the Song, this is
   better still. You know, if there be an orphan child, you cannot prevent
   its continuing an orphan. You may feel great kindness towards it,
   supply its wants, and do all you possibly can towards it, but it is an
   orphan still. It must get its father and its mother back, or else it
   will still be an orphan. So, our blessed Lord, knowing this, does not
   say, "I will do this and that for you," but, "I will come to you."

   Do you not see, dear friends, here is not only all you can want, but
   all you think you can want, wrapped up in a sentence, "I will come to
   you"? "It pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell;" so
   that, when Christ comes, in Him "all fulness" comes. "In Him dwelleth
   all the fulness of the Godhead bodily," so that, when Jesus comes, the
   very Godhead comes to the believer.

   "All my capacious powers can wish

   In Thee doth richly meet;"

   and if Thou shalt come to me, it is better than all the gifts of Thy
   covenant. If I get Thee, I get all, and more than all, at once.
   Observe, then, the language and the sufficiency of the promise.

   But I want you to notice, further, the continued freshness and force of
   the promise. Somebody here owes another person fifty pounds, and he
   gives him a note of hand, "I promise to pay you fifty pounds." Very
   well! the man calls with that note of hand tomorrow, and gets fifty
   pounds. And what is the good of the note of hand now? Why, it is of no
   further value, it is discharged. How would you like to have a note of
   hand which would always stand good? That would be a right royal
   present. "I promise to pay evermore, and this bond, though paid a
   thousand times, shall still hold good." Who would not like to have a
   cheque of that sort? Yet this is the promise which Christ gives you, "I
   will not leave you orphans: I will come to you." The first time a
   sinner looks to Christ, Christ comes to him. And what then? Why, the
   next minute it is still, "I will come to you." But here is one who has
   known Christ for fifty years, and he has had this promise fulfilled a
   thousand times a year: is it not done with? Oh, no! there it stands,
   just as fresh as when Jesus first spoke it, "I will come to you." Then
   we will treat our Lord in His own fashion, and take Him at His word. We
   will go to Him as often as ever we can, for we shall never weary Him;
   and when He has kept His promise most, then is it that we will go to
   Him, and ask Him to keep it more still; and after ten thousand proofs
   of the truth of it, we will only have a greater hungering and thirsting
   to get it fulfilled again. This is fit provision for life, and for
   death, "I will come to you." In the last moment, when your pulse beats
   faintly, and you are just about to pass the curtain, and enter into the
   invisible world, you may have this upon your lips, and say to your
   Lord, "My Master, still fulfil the word on which Thou hast caused me to
   hope, I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.'"

   Let me remind you that the text is at this moment valid, and for this I
   delight in it. "I will not leave you comfortless." That means now, "I
   will not leave you comfortless now." Are you comfortless at this hour?
   It is your own fault. Jesus Christ does not leave you so, nor make you
   so. There are rich and precious things in this word, "I will not leave
   you comfortless: I will come to you, I will come to you now." It may be
   a very dull time with you, and you are pining to come nearer to Christ.
   Very well, then plead the promise before the Lord. Plead the promise as
   you sit where you are: "Lord, Thou hast said Thou wilt come unto me;
   come unto me to-night." There are many reasons, believer, why you
   should plead thus. You want Him; you need Him; you require Him;
   therefore plead the promise, and expect its fulfilment. And oh! when He
   cometh, what a joy it is; He is as a bridegroom coming out of his
   chamber with his garments fragrant with aloes and cassia! How well the
   oil of joy will perfume your heart! How soon will your sackcloth be put
   away, and the garments of gladness adorn you! With what joy of heart
   will your heavy soul begin to sing when Jesus Christ shall whisper that
   you are His, and that He is yours! Come, my Beloved, make no tarrying;
   be Thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of separation,
   and prove to me Thy promise true, "I will not leave you orphans: I will
   come to you."

   And now, dear friends, in conclusion, let me remind you that there are
   many who have no share in the text. What can I say to such? From my
   soul I pity you who do not know what the love of Christ means. Oh! if
   you could but tell the joy of God's people, you would not rest an hour
   without it.

   "His worth, if all the nations knew,

   Sure the whole world would love Him too."

   Remember, if you would find Christ, He is to be found in the way of
   faith. Trust Him, and He is yours. Depend upon the merit of His
   sacrifice; cast yourselves entirely upon that, and you are saved, and
   Christ is yours.

   God grant that we may all break bread in the kingdom above, and feast
   with Jesus, and share His glory! We are expecting His second coming. He
   is coming personally and gloriously. This is the brightest hope of His
   people. This will be the fulness of their redemption, the time of their
   resurrection. Anticipate it, beloved, and may God make your souls to
   sing for joy!

   "Mid the splendours of the glory

   Which we hope ere long to share;

   Christ our Head, and we His members,

   Shall appear, divinely fair.

   Oh, how glorious!

   When we meet Him in the air!

   "Bright the prospect soon that greets us

   Of that long'd-for nuptial day,

   When our heavenly Bridegroom meets us

   On His kingly, conquering way;

   In the glory,

   Bride and Bridegroom reign for aye!"
     __________________________________________________________________

                     COMMUNION WITH CHRIST AND HIS PEOPLE.

  AN ADDRESS AT A COMMUNION SERVICE AT MENTONE. "The cup of blessing which we
  bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we
  break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are
  one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."--1 Cor.
  x. 16, 17.

COMMUNION WITH CHRIST AND HIS PEOPLE.

   I WILL read you the text as it is given in the Revised Version: "The
   cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of
   Christ?" That is to say,--Is it not one form of expressing the
   communion of the blood of Christ? "The bread," or as it is in the
   margin, "the loaf which we break, is it not a communion of the body of
   Christ? seeing that we, who are many, are one loaf, one body: for we
   all partake of the one loaf." The word "loaf" helps to bring out more
   clearly the idea of unity intended to be set forth by the apostle.

   It is a lamentable fact that some have fancied that this simple
   ordinance of the Lord's supper has a certain magical, or at least
   physical power about it, so that, by the mere act of eating and
   drinking this bread and wine, men can be made partakers of the body and
   blood of Christ. It is marvellous that so plain a symbol should have
   been so complicated by genuflexions, adornments, and technical phrases.
   Can anyone see the slightest resemblance between the Master's sitting
   down with the twelve, and the mass of the Roman community? The original
   rite is lost in the super-imposed ritual. Superstition has produced a
   sacrament where Jesus intended a fellowship. Too many, who would not go
   the length of Rome, yet speak of this simple feast as if it were a
   mystery dark and obscure. They employ all manner of hard words to turn
   the children's bread into a stone. It is not the Lord's supper, but the
   Eucharist; we see before us no plate, but a "paten"; the cup is a
   "chalice" and the table is an "altar." These are incrustations of
   superstition, whereby the blessed ordinance of Christ is likely to be
   again overgrown and perverted.

   What does this supper mean? It means communion: communion with Christ,
   and communion with one another.

   What is communion? The word breaks up easily into union, and its prefix
   com, which means with, union with. We must, therefore, first enjoy
   union with Christ, and with His Church, or else we cannot enjoy
   communion. Union lies at the basis of communion. We must be one with
   Christ in heart, and soul, and life; baptized into His death; quickened
   by His life, and so brought to be members of His body, one with the
   whole Church of which He is the Head. We cannot have communion with
   Christ till we are in union with Him; and we cannot have communion with
   the Church till we are in vital union with it.

   I. The teaching of the Lord's supper is just this--that while we have
   many ways of communion with Christ, yet the receiving of Christ into
   our souls as our Saviour is the best way of communion with Him.

   I said, dear friends, that we have many ways of communion with Christ;
   let me show you that it is so.

   Communion is ours by personal intercourse with the Lord Jesus. We speak
   with Him in prayer, and He speaks with us through the Word. Some of us
   speak oftener with Christ than we do with wife or child, and our
   communion with Jesus is deeper and more thorough than our fellowship
   with our nearest friend. In meditation and its attendant thanksgiving
   we speak with our risen Lord, and by His Holy Spirit He answers us by
   creating fresh thought and emotion in our minds. I like sometimes in
   prayer, when I do not feel that I can say anything, just to sit still,
   and look up; then faith spiritually descries the Well-beloved, and
   hears His voice in the solemn silence of the mind. Thus we have
   intercourse with Jesus of a closer sort than any words could possibly
   express. Our soul melts beneath the warmth of Jesus' love, and darts
   upward her own love in return. Think not that I am dreaming, or am
   carried off by the memory of some unusual rhapsody: no, I assert that
   the devout soul can converse with the Lord Jesus all the day, and can
   have as true fellowship with Him as if He still dwelt bodily among men.
   This thing comes to me, not by the hearing of the ear, but by my own
   personal experience: I know of a surety that Jesus manifests Himself
   unto His people as He doth not unto the world.

   Ah, what sweet communion often exists between the saint and the
   Well-beloved, when there is no bread and wine upon the table, for the
   Spirit Himself draws the heart of the renewed one, and it runs after
   Jesus, while the Lord Himself appears unto the longing spirit! Truly
   our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. Do
   you enjoy this charming converse?

   Next, we have communion with Christ in His thoughts, views, and
   purposes; for His thoughts are our thoughts according to our capacity
   and sanctity. Believers take the same view of matters as Jesus does;
   that which pleases Him pleases them, and that which grieves Him grieves
   them also. Consider, for instance, the greatest theme of our thought,
   and see whether our thoughts are not like those of Christ. He delights
   in the Father, He loves to glorify the Father: do not we? Is not the
   Father the centre of our soul's delight? Do we not rejoice at the very
   sound of His name? Does not our spirit cry, "Abba, Father"? Thus it is
   clear we feel as Jesus feels towards the Father, and so we have the
   truest communion with Him. This is but one instance; your
   contemplations will bring before you a wide variety of topics wherein
   we think with Jesus. Now, identity of judgment, opinion, and purpose
   forms the highway of communion; yea, it is communion.

   We have also communion with Christ in our emotions. Have you never felt
   a holy horror when you have heard a word of blasphemy in the street?
   Thus Jesus felt when He saw sin, and bore it in His own person: only He
   felt it infinitely more than you do. Have you never felt as you looked
   upon sinners that you must weep over them? Those are holy tears, and
   contain the same ingredients as those which Jesus shed when He lamented
   over Jerusalem. Yes, in our zeal for God, our hatred of sin, our
   detestation of falsehood, our pity for men, we have true communion with
   Jesus.

   Further, we have had fellowship with Christ in many of our actions.
   Have you ever tried to teach the ignorant? This Jesus did. Have you
   found it difficult? So Jesus found it. Have you striven to reclaim the
   backslider? Then you were in communion with the Good Shepherd who
   hastens into the wilderness to find the one lost sheep, finds it, lays
   it upon His shoulders, and brings it home rejoicing. Have you ever
   watched over a soul night and day with tears? Then you have had
   communion with Him who has borne all our names upon His broken heart,
   and carries the memorial of them upon His pierced hands. Yes, in acts
   of self-denial, liberality, benevolence, and piety, we enter into
   communion with Him who went about doing good. Whenever we try to
   disentangle the snarls of strife, and to make peace between men who are
   at enmity, then are we doing what the great Peace-maker did, and we
   have communion with the Lord and Giver of peace. Wherever, indeed, we
   co-operate with the Lord Jesus in His designs of love to men, we are in
   true and active communion with Him.

   So it is with our sorrows. Certain of us have had large fellowship with
   the Lord Jesus in affliction. "Jesus wept": He lost a friend, and so
   have we. Jesus grieved over the hardness of men's hearts: we know that
   grief. Jesus was exceedingly sorry that the hopeful young man turned
   away, and went back to the world: we know that sorrow. Those who have
   sympathetic hearts, and live for others, readily enter into the
   experience of "the Man of sorrows." The wounds of calumny, the
   reproaches of the proud, the venom of the bigoted, the treachery of the
   false, and the weakness of the true, we have known in our measure; and
   therein have had communion with our Lord Jesus.

   Nor this alone: we have been with our Divine Master in His joys. I
   suppose there never lived a happier man than the Lord Jesus. He was
   rightly called "the Man of sorrows"; but He might, with unimpeachable
   truth, have been called, "the Man of joys." He must have rejoiced as He
   called His disciples, and they came unto Him; as He bestowed healing
   and relief; as He gave pardon to penitents, and breathed peace on
   believers. His was the joy of finding the sheep, and taking the piece
   of money out of the dust. His work was His joy: such joy that, for its
   sake, He endured the cross, despising the shame. The exercise of
   benevolence is joy to loving hearts: the more pain it costs, the more
   joy it is. Kind actions make us happy, and in such joy we find
   communion with the great heart of Jesus.

   Thus have I given you a list of windows of agate and gates of carbuncle
   through which you may come at the Lord; but the ordinance of the Lord's
   supper sets forth a way which surpasses them all. It is the most
   accessible and the most effectual method of fellowship. Here it is that
   we have fellowship with the Lord Jesus by receiving Him as our Saviour.
   We, being guilty, accept of His atonement as our sacrificial cleansing,
   and in token thereof we eat this bread and drink this cup. "Oh!" says
   one, "I do not feel that I can get near to Christ. He is so high and
   holy, and I am only a poor sinner." Just so. For that very reason you
   can have fellowship with Christ in that which lies nearest to His
   heart: He is a Saviour, and to be a Saviour there must be a sinner to
   be saved. Be you that one, and Christ and you shall at once be in union
   and communion: He shall save, and you shall be saved; He shall
   sanctify, and you shall be sanctified; and twain shall thus be one.
   This table sets before you His great sacrifice. Jesus has offered it;
   will you accept it? He does not ask you to bring anything,--no drop of
   blood, no pang of flesh; all is here, and your part is to come and
   partake of it, even as of old the offerer partook of the peace-offering
   which he had brought, and so feasted with God and with the priest. If
   you work for Christ, that will certainly be some kind of fellowship
   with Him; but I tell you that the communion of receiving him into your
   inmost soul is the nearest and closest fellowship possible to mortal
   man. The fellowship of service is exceedingly honourable, when we and
   Christ work together for the same objects; the fellowship of suffering
   is exceedingly instructive, when our heart has graven upon it the same
   characters as were graven upon the heart of Christ: but the fellowship
   of the soul which receives Christ, and is received by Christ, is
   closer, more vital, more essential than any other.

   Such fellowship is eternal. No power upon earth can henceforth take
   from me the piece of bread which I have just now eaten, it has gone
   where it will be made up into blood, and nerve, and muscle, and bone.
   It is within me, and of me. That drop of wine has coursed through my
   veins, and is part and parcel of my being. So he that takes Jesus by
   faith to be his Saviour has chosen the good part which shall not be
   taken away from him. He has received the Christ into his inward parts,
   and all the men on earth, and all the devils in hell, cannot extract
   Christ from him. Jesus saith, "He that eateth Me, even he shall live by
   Me." By our sincere reception of Jesus into our hearts, an indissoluble
   union is established between us and the Lord, and this manifests itself
   in mutual communion. To as many as received Him, to them has He given
   this communion, even to them that believe on His name.

   II. I have now to look at another side of communion,--namely, the
   fellowship of true believers with each other. We have many ways of
   communing the one with the other, but there is no way of mutual
   communing like the common reception of the same Christ in the same way.
   I have said that there are many ways in which Christians commune with
   one another, and these doors of fellowship I would mention at some
   length.

   Let me go over much the same ground as before. We commune by holy
   converse. I wish we had more of this. Time was when they that feared
   the Lord spake often one to another; I am afraid that now they more
   often speak one against another. It is a grievous thing that full often
   love lies bleeding by a brother's hand. Where we are not quite so bad
   as that, yet we are often backward and silent, and so miss profitable
   converse. Our insular reserve has often made one Christian sit by
   another in utter isolation, when each would have been charmed with the
   other's company. Children of one family need not wait to be introduced
   to each other: having eaten of this one bread, we have given and
   received the token of brotherhood; let us therefore act consistently
   with our relationship, and fall into holy conversation next time we
   meet. I am afraid that Christian brotherhood in many cases begins and
   ends inside the place of worship. Let it not be so among us. Let it be
   our delight to find our society in the circle of which Jesus is the
   centre, and let us make those our friends who are the friends of Jesus.
   By frequent united prayer and praise, and by ministering the one to the
   other the things which we have learned by the Spirit, we shall have
   fellowship with each other in our Lord Jesus Christ.

   I am sure that all Christians have fellowship together in their
   thoughts. In the essentials of the gospel we think alike: in our
   thoughts of God, of Christ, of sin, of holiness, we keep step; in our
   intense desire to promote the kingdom of our Lord, we are as one. All
   spiritual life is one. The thoughts raised by the Spirit of God in the
   souls of men are never contrary to each other. I say not that the
   thoughts of all professors agree, but I do assert that the minds of the
   truly regenerate in all sects, and in all ages, are in harmony with
   each other,--a harmony which often excites delighted surprise in those
   who perceive it. The marks that divide one set of nominal Christians
   from another set are very deep and wide to those who have nothing of
   religion but the name; yet living believers scarcely notice them.
   Boundaries which separate the cattle of the field are no division to
   the birds of the air. Our minds, thoughts, desires, and hopes are one
   in Christ Jesus, and herein we have communion.

   Beloved friends, our emotions are another royal road of fellowship. You
   sit down and tell your experience, and I smile to think that you are
   telling mine. Sometimes a young believer enlarges upon the sad story of
   his trials and temptations, imagining that nobody ever had to endure so
   great a fight, when all the while he is only describing the common
   adventures of those who go on pilgrimage, and we are all communing with
   him. When we talk together about our Lord, are we not agreed? When we
   speak of our Father, and all His dealings with us, are we not one? And
   when we weep, and when we sigh, and when we sing, and when we rejoice,
   are we not all akin? Heavenly fingers touching like strings within our
   hearts bring forth the self-same notes, for we are the products of the
   same Maker, and tuned to the same praise. Real harmony exists among all
   the true people of God: Christians are one in Christ.

   We have communion with one another, too, in our actions. We unite in
   trying to save men: I hope we do. We join in instructing, warning,
   inviting, and persuading sinners to come to Jesus. Our life-ministry is
   the same: we are workers together with God. We live out the one
   desire,--"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
   heaven."

   Certainly we have much communion one with the other in our sufferings.
   There is not a poor sick or despondent saint upon the earth with whom
   we do not sympathize at this moment, for we are fellow-members, and
   partakers of the sufferings of Christ. I hope we can say,

   "Is there a lamb in all Thy flock,

   I would disdain to feed?

   Is there a foe, before whose face,

   I fear Thy cause to plead?"

   No, we suffer with each other, and bear each other's burden, and so
   fulfil the law of Christ. If we do not, we have reason for questioning
   our own faith; but if we do so, we have communion with each other.

   I hope we have fellowship in our joys. Is one happy? We would not envy
   him, but rejoice with him. Perhaps this is not so universal as it
   should be among professors. Are we at once glad because another
   prospers? If another star outshines ours, do we delight in its
   radiance? When we meet a brother with ten talents, do we congratulate
   ourselves on having such a man given to help us, or do we depreciate
   him as much as we can? Such is the depravity of our nature, that we do
   not readily rejoice in the progress of others if they leave us behind;
   but we must school ourselves to this. A man will speedily sit down and
   sympathize with a friend's griefs; but if he sees him honoured and
   esteemed, he is apt to regard him as a rival, and does not so readily
   rejoice with him. This ought not to be; without effort we ought to be
   happy in our brother's happiness. If we are ill, be this our comfort,
   that many are in robust health; if we are faint, let us be glad that
   others are strong in the Lord. Thus shall we enjoy a happy fellowship
   like that of the perfected above.

   When I have put all these modes of Christian communion together, no one
   of them is so sure, so strong, so deep, as communion in receiving the
   same Christ as our Saviour, and trusting in the same blood for
   cleansing unto eternal life. Here on the table you have the tokens of
   the broadest and fullest communion. This is a kind of communion which
   you and I cannot choose or reject: if we are in Christ, it is and must
   be ours. Certain brethren restrict their communion in the outward
   ordinance, and they think they have good reasons for doing so; but I am
   unable to see the force of their reasoning, because I joyfully observe
   that these brethren commune with other believers in prayer, and praise,
   and hearing of the Word, and other ways: the fact being that the matter
   of real communion is very largely beyond human control, and is to the
   spiritual body what the circulation of the blood is to the natural
   body, a necessary process not dependent upon volition. In perusing a
   deeply spiritual book of devotion, you have been charmed and
   benefitted, and yet upon looking at the title-page it may be you have
   found that the author belonged to the Church of Rome. What then? Why,
   then it has happened that the inner life has broken all barriers, and
   your spirits have communed. For my own part, in reading certain
   precious works, I have loathed their Romanism, and yet I have had close
   fellowship with their writers in weeping over sin, in adoring at the
   foot of the cross, and in rejoicing in the glorious enthronement of our
   Lord. Blood is thicker than water, and no fellowship is more inevitable
   and sincere than fellowship in the precious blood, and in the risen
   life of our Lord Jesus Christ. Here, in the common reception of the one
   loaf, we bear witness that we are one; and in the actual participation
   of all the chosen in the one redemption, that unity is in very deed
   displayed and matured in the most substantial manner. Washed in the one
   blood, fed on the same loaf, cheered by the same cup, all differences
   pass away, and "we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
   members one of another."

   Now, then, dear friends, if this kind of fellowship be the best, let us
   take care to enjoy it. Let us at this hour avail ourselves of it.

   Let us take care to see Christ in the mirror of this ordinance. Have
   any of you eaten the bread, and yet have you not seen Christ? Then you
   have gained no benefit. Have you drunk the wine, but have you not
   remembered the Lord? Alas! I fear you have eaten and drunk condemnation
   to yourselves, not discerning the Lord's body. But if you did see
   through the emblems, as aged persons see through their spectacles, then
   you have been thankful for such aids to vision. But what is the use of
   glasses if there is nothing to look at? and what is the use of the
   communion if Christ be not in our thoughts and hearts?

   If you did discern the Lord, then be sure, again, to accept Him. Say to
   yourself, "All that Christ is to any, He shall be to me. Does He save
   sinners? He shall save me. Does He change men's hearts? He shall change
   mine. Is He all in all to those that trust Him? He shall be all in all
   to me." I have heard persons say that they do not know how to take
   Christ. What says the apostle? "The Word is nigh thee, even in thy
   mouth, and in thy heart." If you have something in your mouth that you
   desire to eat, what is the best thing to do? Will you not swallow it?
   That is exactly what faith does. Christ's word of grace is very near
   you, it is on your tongue; let it go down into your inmost soul. Say to
   your Saviour, "I know I am not fit to receive Thee, O Jesus, but since
   Thou dost graciously come to me as bread comes to the hungry, I
   thankfully receive Thee, rejoicing to feed upon Thee! Since Thou dost
   come to me as the fruit of the vine to a thirsty man, Lord, I take
   Thee, willingly, and I thank Thee that this reception is all that Thou
   dost require of me. Has not Thy Spirit so put it--As many as received
   Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that
   believe on His name'?"

   Beloved friends, when you have thus received Jesus, fail not to rejoice
   in Him as having received Him. How many there are who have received
   Christ, who talk and act as if they never had received Him! It is a
   poor dinner of which a man says, after he has eaten it, that he feels
   as if he had not dined; and it is a poor Christ of whom anyone can say,
   "I have received Him, but I am none the happier, none the more at
   peace." If you have received Jesus into your heart, you are saved, you
   are justified. Do you whisper, "I hope so"? Is that all? Do you not
   know? The hopings and hoppings of so many are a poor way of going; put
   both feet down, and say, "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
   that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against
   that day." You are either saved or lost; there is no state between the
   two. You are either pardoned or condemned; and you have good reason for
   the highest happiness, or else you have grave causes for the direst
   anxiety. If you have received the atonement, be as glad as you can be;
   and if you are still an unbeliever, rest not till Christ is yours.

   Oh, the joy of continually entering into fellowship with Christ, in
   such a way that you never lose His company! Be this yours, beloved,
   every day, and all the day! May His shadow fall upon you as you rest in
   the sun, or stray in the gardens! May His voice cheer you as you lie
   down upon the sea-shore, and listen to the murmuring of the waves; may
   His presence glorify the mountain solitude as you climb the hills! May
   Jesus be to you an all-surrounding presence, lighting up the night,
   perfuming the day, gladdening all places, and sanctifying all pursuits!
   Our Beloved is not a Friend for Lord's-days only, but for week-days,
   too; He is the inseparable Companion of His loving disciples. Those who
   have had fellowship with His body and His blood at this table may have
   the Lord as an habitual Guest at their own tables; those who have met
   their Master in this upper room may expect Him to make their own
   chamber bright with His royal presence. Let fellowship with Jesus and
   with the elect brotherhood be henceforth the atmosphere of our life,
   the joy of our existence. This will give us a heaven below, and prepare
   us for a heaven above.

                                THE SIN-BEARER.

  A COMMUNION MEDITATION AT MENTONE. "Who His own self bare our sins in His own
  body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
  by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are
  now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."--1 Peter ii. 24, 25.

THE SIN-BEARER.

   THIS wonderful passage is a part of Peter's address to servants; and in
   his day nearly all servants were slaves. Peter begins at the eighteenth
   verse: "Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to
   the good and gentle, but also to the froward. For this is thankworthy,
   if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
   For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall
   take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take
   it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye
   called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
   that ye should follow His steps: who did no sin, neither was guile
   found in His mouth: who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when
   He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to Him that
   judgeth righteously: who His own self bare our sins in His own body on
   the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
   by whose stripes ye were healed." If we are in a lowly condition of
   life, we shall find our best comfort in thinking of the lowly Saviour
   bearing our sins in all patience and submission. If we are called to
   suffer, as servants often were in the Roman times, we shall be solaced
   by a vision of our Lord buffeted, scourged, and crucified, yet silent
   in the majesty of His endurance. If these sufferings are entirely
   undeserved, and we are grossly slandered, we shall be comforted by
   remembering Him who did no sin, and in whose lips was found no guile.
   Our Lord Jesus is Head of the Guild of Sufferers: He did well, and
   suffered for it, but took it patiently. Our support under the cross,
   which we are appointed to bear, is only to be found in Him "who His own
   self bare our sins in His own body on the tree."

   We ourselves now know by experience that there is no place for comfort
   like the cross. It is a tree stripped of all foliage, and apparently
   dead; yet we sit under its shadow with great delight, and its fruit is
   sweet unto our taste. Truly, in this case, "like cures like." By the
   suffering of our Lord Jesus, our suffering is made light. The servant
   is comforted since Jesus took upon Himself the form of a servant; the
   sufferer is cheered "because Christ also suffered for us;" and the
   slandered one is strengthened because Jesus also was reviled.

   "Is it not strange, the darkest hour

   That ever dawned on sinful earth

   Should touch the heart with softer power

   For comfort than an angel's mirth?

   That to the cross the mourner's eye should turn

   Sooner than where the stars of Christmas burn?"

   Let us, as we hope to pass through the tribulations of this world,
   stand fast by the cross; for if that be gone, the lone-star is quenched
   whose light cheers the down-trodden, shines on the injured, and brings
   light to the oppressed. If we lose the cross,--if we miss the
   substitutionary sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ, we have lost all.

   The verse on which we would now devoutly meditate speaks of three
   things: the bearing of our sins, the changing of our condition, and the
   healing of our spiritual diseases. Each of these deserves our most
   careful notice.

   I. The first is, the bearing of our sins by our Lord; "Who His own self
   bare our sins in His own body on the tree." These words in plainest
   terms assert that our Lord Jesus did really bear the sins of His
   people. How literal is the language! Words mean nothing if substitution
   is not stated here. I do not know the meaning of the fifty-third of
   Isaiah if this is not its meaning. Hear the prophet's words: "The Lord
   hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all;" "for the transgression of my
   people was He stricken;" "He shall bear their iniquities:" "He was
   numbered with the transgressors, and He bare the sin of many."

   I cannot imagine that the Holy Spirit would have used language so
   expressive if He had not intended to teach us that our Saviour did
   really bear our sins, and suffer in our stead. What else can be
   intended by texts like these--"Christ was once offered to bear the sins
   of many" (Heb. ix. 28); "He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no
   sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him" (2 Cor. v.
   21); "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
   curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
   tree" (Gal. iii. 13); "Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
   Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling
   savour" (Eph. v. 2); "Once in the end of the world hath He appeared to
   put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself" (Heb. ix. 26)? I say
   modestly, but firmly, that these Scriptures either teach the bearing of
   our sins by our Lord Jesus, or they teach nothing. In these days, among
   many errors and denials of truth, there has sprung up a teaching of
   "modern thought" which explains away the doctrine of substitution and
   vicarious sacrifice. One wise man has gone so far as to say that the
   transference of sin or righteousness is impossible, and another
   creature of the same school has stigmatized the idea as immoral.

   "He bore on the tree the sentence for me."

   Had the sorrow been figurative, the sin-bearing might have been
   mythical; but the one fact is paralleled by the other. There is no
   figure in our text; it is a bare, literal fact: "Who His own self bare
   our sins in His own body on the tree." Oh, that men would give up
   cavilling! To question and debate at the cross, is an act near akin to
   the crime of the soldiers when they parted His garments among them, and
   cast lots for His vesture.

   Note how personal are the terms here employed! How expressly the Holy
   Ghost speaketh! "Who His own self bare our sins in His own body." It
   was not by delegation, but "His own self"; and it was not in
   imagination, but "in His own body." Observe, also, the personality from
   our side of the question, He "bare our sins," that is to say, my sins
   and your sins. There is a sort of cadence of music here,--"His own
   self," "our sins." As surely as it was Christ's own self that suffered
   on the cross, so truly was it our own sins that Jesus bore in His own
   body on the tree. Our Lord has appeared in court for us, accepting our
   place at the bar: "He was numbered with the transgressors." Nay, more,
   He has appeared at the place of execution for us, and has borne the
   death-penalty upon the gibbet of doom in our stead. In propria persona,
   our Redeemer has been arraigned, though innocent; has come under the
   curse, though for ever blessed; and has suffered to the death, though
   He had done nothing worthy of blame. "He was wounded for our
   transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
   our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed."

   This sin-bearing on our Lord's part was continual. The passage before
   us has been forced beyond its teaching, by being made to assert that
   our Lord Jesus bore our sins nowhere but on the cross: this the words
   do not say. "The tree" was the place where beyond all other places we
   see our Lord bearing the chastisement due to our sins; but before this,
   He had felt the weight of the enormous load. It is wrong to base a
   great doctrine upon the incidental form of one passage of Scripture,
   especially when that passage of Scripture bears another meaning.

   The marginal reading, which is perfectly correct, is "Who His own self
   bare our sins in His own body to the tree." Our Lord carried the burden
   of our sins up to the tree, and there and then He made an end of it. He
   had carried that load long before, for John the Baptist said of Him,
   "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away" (the verb is in the present
   tense, "which taketh away") "the sin of the world" (John i. 29). Our
   Lord was then bearing the sin of the world as the Lamb of God. From the
   day when He began His divine ministry, I might say even before that, He
   bore our sins. He was the Lamb "slain from the foundation of the
   world;" so, when He went up to Calvary, bearing His cross, He was
   bearing our sins up to the tree. Yet, specially and peculiarly in His
   death-agony He stood in our stead, and upon His soul and body burst the
   tempest of justice which had gathered through our transgressions.

   This sin-bearing is final. He bore our sins in His own body on the
   tree, but He bears them now no more. The sinner and the sinner's Surety
   are both free, for the law is vindicated, the honour of government is
   cleared, the substitutionary sacrifice is complete. He dieth no more,
   death hath no more dominion over Him; for He has ended His work, and
   has cried, "It is finished." As for the sins which He bore in His own
   body on the tree, they cannot be found, for they have ceased to be,
   according to that ancient promise, "In those days, and in that time,
   saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there
   shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found"
   (Jeremiah i. 20). The work of the Messiah was "to finish the
   transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation
   for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness" (Daniel ix.
   24). Now, if sin is made an end of, there is an end of it; and if
   transgression is "finished," there is no more to be said about it.

   Let us look back with holy faith, and see Jesus bearing the stupendous
   load of our sins up to the tree, and on the tree; and see how effectual
   was His sacrifice for discharging the whole mass of our moral liability
   both in reference to guiltiness in the sight of God, and the punishment
   which follows thereon. It is a law of nature that nothing can be in two
   places at the same time; and if sin was borne away by our Lord, it
   cannot rest upon us. If by faith we have accepted the Substitute whom
   God Himself has accepted, then it cannot be that the penalty should be
   twice demanded, first of the Surety, and then of those for whom He
   stood. The Lord Jesus bore the sins of His people away, even as the
   scape-goat, in the type, carried the sin of Israel to a land
   uninhabited. Our sins are gone forever. "As far as the east is from the
   west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us." He hath cast
   all our iniquities into the depths of the sea; he hath hurled them
   behind his back, where they shall no more be seen.

   Beloved friends, we very calmly and coolly talk about this thing, but
   it is the greatest marvel in the universe; it is the miracle of earth,
   the mystery of heaven, the terror of hell. Could we fully realize the
   guilt of sin, the punishment due to it, and the literal substitution of
   Christ, it would work in us an intense enthusiasm of gratitude, love,
   and praise. I do not wonder that our Methodist friends shout,
   "Hallelujah!" This is enough to make us all shout and sing, as long as
   we live, "Glory, glory to the Son of God!" What a wonder that the
   Prince of glory, in whom is no sin, who was indeed incapable of evil,
   should condescend to come into such contact with our sin as is implied
   in His being "made sin for us"! Our Lord Jesus did not handle sin with
   the golden tongs, but He bore it on His own shoulders. He did not lift
   it with golden staves, as the priests carried the ark; but He Himself
   bore the hideous load of our sin in His own body on the tree. This is
   the mystery of grace which angels desire to look into. I would forever
   preach it in the plainest and most unmistakable language.

   II. In the second place, briefly notice the change in our condition,
   which the text describes as coming out of the Lord's bearing of our
   sins: "That we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness."
   The change is a dying and a reviving, a burial and a resurrection: we
   are brought from life to death, and from death to life.

   We are henceforth legally dead to the punishment of sin. If I were
   condemned to die for an offence, and some other died in my stead, then
   I died in him who died for me. The law could not a second time lay its
   charge against me, and bring me again before the judge, and condemn me,
   and lead me out to die. Where would be the justice of such a procedure?
   I am dead already: how can I die again? I have borne the wrath of God
   in the person of my glorious and ever-blessed Substitute; how then can
   I bear it again? Where was the use of a Substitute if I am to bear it
   also? Should Satan come before God to lay an accusation against me, the
   answer is, "This man is dead. He has borne the penalty, and is dead to
   sins,' for the sentence against him has been executed upon Another."
   What a wonderful deliverance for us! Bless the Lord, O my soul!

   But Peter also means to remind us that, by and through the influence of
   Christ's death upon our hearts, the Holy Ghost has made us now to be
   actually "dead to sins": that is to say, we no longer love them, and
   they have ceased to hold dominion over us. Sin is no longer at home in
   our hearts; if it enters there, it is as an intruder. We are no more
   its willing servants. Sin calls to us by temptation, but we give it no
   answer, for we are dead to its voice. Sin promises us a high reward,
   but we do not consent, for we are dead to its allurements. We sin, but
   our will is not to sin. It would be heaven to us to be perfectly holy.
   Our heart and life go after perfection, but sin is abhorred of our
   soul. "Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it,
   but sin that dwelleth in me." Our truest and most real self loathes
   sin; and though we fall into it, it is a fall,--we are out of our
   element, and escape from the evil with all speed. The new-born life
   within us has no dealings with sin; it is dead to sin.

   The Greek word here used cannot be fully rendered into English; it
   signifies "being unborn to sins." We were born in sin, but by the death
   of Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit upon us, that birth is
   undone, "we are unborn to sins." That which was wrought in us by sin,
   even at our birth, is through the death of Jesus counteracted by the
   new life which His Spirit imparts. "We are unborn to sins." I like the
   phrase, unusual as it sounds. Does it seem possible that birth should
   be reversed: the born unborn? Yet so it is. The true ego, the realest
   "I," is now unborn to sins, for we are "born, not of blood, nor of the
   will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." We are unborn
   to sins, and born unto God.

   But our Lord's sin-bearing has also brought us into life. Dead to evil
   according to law, we also live in newness of life in the kingdom of
   grace. Our Lord's object is "that we should live unto righteousness."
   Not only are our lives to be righteous, which I trust they are, but we
   are quickened and made sensitive and vigorous unto righteousness:
   through our Lord's death we are made quick of eye, and quick of
   thought, and quick of lip, and quick of heart unto righteousness.
   Certainly, if the doctrine of His atoning sacrifice does not vivify us,
   nothing will. When we sin, it is the sorrowful result of our former
   death; but when we work righteousness, we throw our whole soul into it,
   "We live unto righteousness." Because our Divine Lord has died, we feel
   that we must lay ourselves out for His praise. The tree which brought
   death to our Saviour is a tree of life to us. Sit under this true arbor
   vitae, and you will shake off the weakness and disease which came in by
   that tree of knowledge of good and evil. Livingstone in Africa used
   certain medicines which are known as Livingstone's Rousers; but what
   rousers are those glorious truths which are extracted from the bitter
   wood of the cross! O my brethren, let us show in our lives what wonders
   our Lord Jesus has done for us by His agony and bloody sweat, by His
   cross and passion!

   III. The apostle then speaks of the healing of our diseases by Christ's
   death: "By whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going
   astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your
   souls."

   We were healed, and we remain so. It is not a thing to be done in the
   future; it has been wrought. Peter describes our disease in the words
   which compose verse twenty-five. What was it, then?

   First, it was brutishness. "Ye were as sheep." Sin has made us so that
   we are only fit to be compared to beasts, and to those of the least
   intelligence. Sometimes the Scripture compares the unregenerate man to
   an ass. Man is said to be "born like a wild ass's colt." Amos likens
   Israel to the "kine of Bashan," and he saith to them, "Ye shall go out
   at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her." David compared
   himself to behemoth: "So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast
   before Thee." We are nothing better than beasts until Christ comes to
   us. But we are not beasts after that: a living, heavenly, spiritual
   nature is created within us when we come into contact with our
   Redeemer. We still carry about with us the old brutish nature, but by
   the grace of God it is put in subjection, and kept there; and our
   fellowship now is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. We
   "were as sheep," but we are now men redeemed unto God.

   We are cured also of the proneness to wander which is so remarkable in
   sheep. "Ye were as sheep going astray," always going astray, loving to
   go astray, delighting in it, never so happy as when they are wandering
   away from the fold. We wander still, but not as sheep wander: we now
   seek the right way, and desire to follow the Lamb whithersoever He
   goeth. If we wander, it is through ignorance or temptation. We can
   truly say, "My soul followeth hard after Thee." Our Lord's cross has
   nailed us fast as to hands and feet: we cannot now run greedily after
   iniquity; rather do we say, "Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the
   Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee!"

   "My wanderings, Lord, are at an end,

   I'm now return'd to Thee:

   Be Thou my Father and my Friend,

   Be all in all to me."

   Another disease of ours was inability to return: "Ye were as sheep
   going astray; but are now returned." Dogs and even swine are more
   likely to return home than wandering sheep. But now, beloved, though we
   wandered, we have returned, and do still return to our Shepherd. Like
   Noah's dove, we have found no rest for the sole of our foot anywhere
   out of the ark, and therefore we return unto Him, and He graciously
   pulls us in unto Him. If we wander at any time, we bless God that there
   is a sacred something within us which will not let us rest, and there
   is a far more powerful something above us which draws us back. We are
   like the needle in the compass: touch that needle with your finger, and
   compel it to point to the east, or to the south, and it may do so for
   the moment; but take away the pressure, and in an instant it returns to
   the pole. So we must go back to Jesus; we must return to the Bishop of
   our souls. Our soul cries, "Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there
   is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee." Thus, by the virtue of
   our Lord's death, an immortal love is created in us, which leads us to
   seek His face, and renew our fellowship with Him.

   Our Lord's death has also cured us of our readiness to follow other
   leaders. If one sheep goes through a gap in the hedge, the whole flock
   will follow. We have been accustomed to follow ringleaders in sin or in
   error: we have been too ready to follow custom, and to do that which is
   judged proper, respectable, and usual: but now we are resolved to
   follow none but Jesus, according to His word, "My sheep hear My voice,
   and I know them, and they follow Me. A stranger will they not follow,
   but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers." For
   my own part, I am resolved to follow no human leader. Faith in Jesus
   creates a sacred independence of mind. We have learned so entire a
   dependence upon our crucified Lord that we have none to spare for men.

   Finally, beloved friends, when we were wandering we were like sheep
   exposed to wolves, but we are delivered from this by being near the
   Shepherd. We were in danger of death, in danger from the devil, in
   danger from a thousand temptations, which, like ravenous beasts,
   prowled around us. Having ended our wandering, we are now in a place of
   safety. When the lion roars, we are driven the closer to the Shepherd,
   and rejoice that His crook protects us. He says, "My sheep hear My
   voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: and I give unto them
   eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
   them out of My hand."

   What a wonderful work of grace has been wrought in us! We owe all this,
   not to the teaching of Christ, though that has helped us greatly; not
   to the example of Christ, though that is charming us into a diligent
   copying of it; but we owe it all to His stripes: "By whose stripes ye
   were healed." Brethren, we preach Christ crucified, because we have
   been saved by Christ crucified. His death is the death of our sins. We
   can never give up the doctrine of Christ's substitutionary sacrifice,
   for it is the power by which we hope to be made holy. Not only are we
   washed from guilt in His blood, but by that blood we overcome sin.
   Never, so long as breath or pulse remains, can we conceal the blessed
   truth that He "His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree,
   that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness." The Lord
   give us to know much more of this than I can speak, for Jesus Christ's
   sake! Amen.

                      SWOONING AND REVIVING CHRIST'S FEET.

  AN ADDRESS DELIVERED AT THE CLOSE OF ONE OF THE PASTORS' COLLEGE CONFERENCES.
  "And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand
  upon me saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am He that
  liveth, and was dead; and, behold. I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the
  keys of hell and of death."--Revelation i. 17, 18.

SWOONING AND REVIVING AT CHRIST'S FEET.

   WE have nothing now to think of but our Lord. We come to Him that He
   may cause us to forget all others. We are not here as ministers,
   cumbered with much serving, but we now sit at His feet with Mary, or
   lean on His bosom with John. The Lord Himself gives us our watchword as
   we muster our band for the last assembly. "Remember Me" is His loving
   command. We beseech Him to fill the full circle of our memory as the
   sun fills the heavens and the earth with light. We are to think only of
   Jesus, and of Him only will I speak. Oh, for a touch of the live coal
   from Him who is our Altar as well as our Sacrifice!

   My text is found in the words of John, in the first chapter of the
   Revelation, at the seventeenth and eighteenth verses:--

   "And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right
   hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I
   am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore,
   Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death."

   John was of all men the most familiar with Jesus, and his Lord had
   never needed to say to him, "Lovest thou Me?" Methinks, if any man
   could have stood erect in the presence of the glorified Saviour, it
   would have been that disciple whom Jesus loved. Love permits us to take
   great liberties: the child will climb the knee of his royal father, and
   no man accuses him of presuming. John had such love, and yet even he
   could not look into the face of the Lord of glory without being
   overcome with awe. While yet in the body, even John must swoon if he be
   indulged with a premature vision of the Well-beloved in His majesty. If
   permitted to see the Lord before our bodies have undergone that
   wondrous change by which we are made like Jesus that we may see Him as
   He is, we shall find the sight to be more than we can bear. A clear
   view of our Lord's heavenly splendour while we are here on earth would
   not be fitting, for it would not be profitable for us always to be
   lying in a swoon at our Redeemer's feet, while there is so much work
   for us to do.

   Permit me, dear brethren, to take my text from its connection, and to
   apply it to ourselves, by bringing it down from the throne up yonder to
   the table here. It may be, I trust it will be, that as we see Jesus
   even here, we shall with John fall at His feet as dead. We shall not
   swoon, but we shall be dead in another sense, most sweetly dead, while
   our life is revealed in Him. After we have thought upon that, we shall
   come to what my text implies: then, may we revive with John, for if he
   had not revived he could never have told us of his fainting fit. Thus
   we shall have death with Christ, and resurrection in Him. Oh, for a
   deep experience of both, by the power of the Holy Spirit!

   I. If we are permitted to see Christ in the simple and instructive
   memorials which are now upon the table, we shall, in a blessed sense,
   fall at His feet as dead.

   For, first, here we see provision for the removal of our sin, and we
   are thus reminded of it. Here is the bread broken because we have
   broken God's law, and must have been broken for ever had there not been
   a bruised Saviour. In this wine we see the token of the blood with
   which we must be cleansed, or else be foul things to be cast away into
   the burnings of Tophet, because abominable in the sight of God.
   Inasmuch as we have before us the memorial of the atonement for sin, it
   reminds us of our death in sin in which we should still have remained
   but for that: grace which spoke us into life and salvation. Are you
   growing great? Be little again as you see that you are nothing but
   slaves that have been ransomed. "God's freed-men" is still your true
   rank. Are you beginning to think that, because you are sanctified; you
   have the less need of daily cleansing? Hear that word, "If we walk in
   the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,"
   yet even then "the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from
   all sin." We sin even when in the highest and divinest fellowship, and
   need still the cleansing blood. How this humbles us before the Lord! We
   are to be winners of sinners, and yet we ourselves are sinners still,
   needing as truly the Bread of life as those to whom we serve it out.

   Ah! and some of us have been very special sinners; and therefore, if we
   love much, it is because we have had much forgiven. We have erred since
   we knew the Saviour, and that is a kind of sinnership which is
   exceedingly grievous; we have sinned since we have entered into the
   highest state of spiritual joy, and have been with Him on the holy
   mount, and have beheld His glory! This breeds a holy shamefacedness. We
   may well fall at Jesus' feet, though He only reveals Himself in bread
   and wine, for these convey a sense of our sinnership while they remind
   us of how our Lord met our sin, and put it away.

   Herein we fall as low as the dead. Where is the "I"? Where is the
   self-glorying? Have you any left in the presence of the crucified
   Saviour? As you in spirit eat His flesh and drink His blood, can you
   glory in your own flesh, or feel the pride of blood and birth? Fie upon
   us if there mingles a tinge of pride with our ministry, or a taint of
   self-laudation with our success! When we see Jesus, our Saviour, the
   Saviour of sinners, surely self will sink, and humility will fall at
   His feet. When we think of Gethsemane and Calvary, and all our great
   Redeemer's pain and agony, surely, by the Holy Ghost, self-glorying,
   self-seeking, and self-will must fall as though slain with a deadly
   wound. "When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead."

   Here, also, we learn a second lesson. Jesus has placed upon this table
   food. The bread sets forth all that is necessary, and the cup all that
   is luxurious: provision for all our wants and for all our right
   desires, all that we need for sustenance and joy. Then, what a
   poverty-stricken soul am I that I cannot find myself in bread! As to
   comforts, I may not think of them; they must be given me or I shall
   never taste them. Brothers, we are Gentlemen Commoners upon the bounty
   of our great Kinsman: we come to His table for our maintenance, we have
   no establishments of our own. He who feeds the sparrows feeds our
   souls; in spiritual things, we no more gather into barns than do the
   blessed birds; our heavenly Father feeds us from that "all fulness"
   which it hath pleased Him to lay up for us in Jesus. We could not live
   an hour spiritually without Him who is not only bread, but life; not
   only the wine which cheereth, but consolation itself. Our life hangs
   upon Jesus; He is our Head as well as our food. We shall never outgrow
   our need of natural bread, and spiritually we shall never rise out of
   our need of a present Christ, but the rather we shall feel a stronger
   craving and a more urgent passion for Him. Look at yonder vain person.
   He feels that he is a great man, and you own that he is your superior
   in gifts; but what a cheat he is, what a foolish creature to dream of
   being somebody! Now will he be found wanting; for, like ourselves, he
   is not sufficient even to think anything of himself. A beggar who has
   to live on alms, to eat the bread of dependence, to take the cup of
   charity,--what has he to boast of? He is the great One who feeds us,
   who gives us all that we enjoy, who is our all in all; and as for us,
   we are suppliants,--I had almost said mendicants,--a community of
   Begging Fr����res, to all personal spiritual wealth as dead as the slain
   on Marathon. The negro slave at least could claim his own breath, but
   we cannot claim even that. The Spirit of God must give us spiritual
   breath, or our life will expire. When we think of this, surely the
   sight of Christ in this bread and Wine, though it be a dim vision
   compared with that which ravished the heart of John, will make us fall
   at the Redeemer's feet as dead.

   The "I" cannot live, for our Lord has provided no food for the vain
   Ego, and its lordliness. He has provided all for necessity, but nothing
   for boasting. Oh, blessed sense of self-annihilation! We have
   experienced it several times this week when certain of those papers
   were read to us by our brethren; and, moreover, we shrivelled right up
   in the blaze of the joy with which our Master favoured us. I hope this
   happy assembly and its heavenly exercises have melted the Ego within
   us, and made it, for the while, flow away in tears. Dying to self is a
   blessed feeling. May we all realize it! When we are weak to the utmost
   in conscious death of self, then are we strong to the fulness of might.
   Swooning away unto self-death, and losing all consciousness of personal
   power, we are introduced into the infinite, and live in God.

   II. Now let us consider how we get alive again, and so know the Lord as
   the resurrection and the life. John did revive, and he tells us how it
   came about. He says of the Ever-blessed One,--"He laid His right hand
   upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am He
   that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen;
   and have the keys of hell and of death."

   All the life-floods of our being will flow with renewed force if, first
   of all, we are brought into contact with Jesus: "He laid His right hand
   upon me." Marvellous patience that He does not set His foot upon us,
   and tread us down as the mire of the streets! I have lain at His feet
   as dead, and had He spurned me as tainted with corruption, I could not
   have impugned His justice. But there is nothing here about His foot!
   That foot has been pierced for us, and it cannot be that the foot which
   has been nailed to the cross for His people should ever trample them in
   His wrath. Hear these words, "He laid His right hand upon me." The
   right hand of His strength and of His glory He laid upon His fainting
   servant. It was the hand of a man. It is the right hand of Him who, in
   all our afflictions, was afflicted, who is a Brother born for
   adversity. Hence, everything about His hand has a reviving influence.
   The speech of sympathy, my brothers, is often too unpractical, and
   hence it is too feeble to revive the fainting; the touch of sympathy is
   far more effectual. You remember that happy story of the wild negro
   child who could never be won till the little lady sat down by her, and
   laid her hand upon her. Eva won poor Topsy by that tender touch. The
   tongue failed, but the hand achieved the victory. So was it with our
   adorable Lord. He showed us that He was bone of our bone and flesh of
   our flesh; He brought Himself into contact with us, and made us
   perceive the reality of His love to us, and then He became more than a
   conqueror over us.

   Thus, we felt that He was no fiction, but a real Christ, for there was
   His hand, and we felt the gentle pressure. The laying on of the right
   hand of the Lord had brought healing to the sick, sight to the blind,
   and even life to the dead, and it is no strange thing that it should
   restore a fainting disciple. May you all feel it at this very moment in
   its full reviving power! May there stream down from the Lord's right
   hand, not merely His sympathy, because He is a man like ourselves, but
   as much of the power of His deity as can be gotten into man, so that we
   may be filled with the fulness of God! That is possible at this
   instant. The Lord's supper represents the giving of the whole body of
   Christ to us, to enter into us for food; surely, if we enter into its
   true meaning, we may expect to be revived and vitalized; for we have
   here more than a mere touch of the hand, it is the whole Christ that
   enters into us spiritually, and so comes into contact with our
   innermost being. I believe in "the real presence": do not you? The
   carnal presence is another thing: that we do not even desire. Lord
   Jesus, come into a many-handed contact with us now by dwelling in us,
   and we in Thee!

   Still, there was something else wanted, for our Lord Jesus, after the
   touch, gave the word: "Fear not; I am the first and the last." What
   does He say? Does He say, "Thou art"? Open your Testaments, and see.
   Does He exclaim, "Fear not; thou art the beloved disciple, John the
   apostle and divine"? I find nothing of the kind. He did not direct His
   servant to look at himself, but to remember the great I Am, his
   Saviour, and Lord. The living comfort of every swooning child of God,
   of everyone who is conscious of a death-wound to the natural "I," lies
   in that majestic "I," who alone can say "I am." You live because there
   is an "I am" who has life in Himself, and has that life for you.

   "I am the first." "I have gone before you, and prepared your way; I
   loved you before you loved Me; I ordained your whole course in life
   before you were in existence. In every work of grace for you and within
   you, I am the first. Like the dew which comes from the Lord, I waited
   not for man, neither tarried for the sons of men. And I also am the
   last, perfecting that which concerneth you, and keeping you unto the
   end. I am the Alpha and the Omega to you, and all the letters in
   between; I began with you, and I shall end with you, if an end can be
   thought of. I march in the van, and I bring up the rear. Your final
   preservation is as much from Me as your hopeful commencement." Brother,
   does a fear arise concerning that dark hour which threatens soon to
   arrive? What hour is that? Jesus knows, and He will be with you through
   the night, and till the day breaketh. If Jesus is the beginning and the
   end to us, what is there else? What have we to fear unless it be those
   unhallowed inventions of our mistrust, those superfluities of
   naughtiness which fashion themselves into unbeliefs, and doubts, and
   unkind imaginings? Christ shuts out everything that could hurt us, for
   He covers all the time, and all the space; He is above the heights, and
   beneath the depths; and everywhere He is Love.

   Read on,--"I am He that liveth." "Because I live, ye shall live also;
   no real death shall befal you, for death hath no more dominion over
   Me,--your Head, your Life." While there is a living Christ in heaven,
   no believer shall ever see death: he shall sleep in Jesus, and that is
   all, for even then he shall be "for ever with the Lord."

   Read on,--"and was dead." "Therefore, though die, you shall go no lower
   than I went; and you shall be brought up again even as I have returned
   from the tomb." Think of Jesus as having traversed the realm of
   death-shade, and you will not fear to follow in His track. Where should
   the dying members rest but on the same couch with their once dying
   Head?

   "And behold, I am alive for evermore." Yes, behold it, and never cease
   to behold it: we serve an ever-living Lord. Brothers, go home from this
   conference in the power of this grand utterance! The dear child may
   sicken, or the precious wife may be taken home; but Christ says, "I am
   alive for evermore." The believing heart can never be a widow, for its
   Husband is the living God. Our Lord Jesus will not leave us orphans, He
   will come unto us. Here is our joy, then: not in ourselves, but in the
   fact that He ever lives to carry out the Father's good pleasure in us
   and for us. Onward, soldiers of the cross, for our immortal Captain
   leads the way.

   Read once more,--"and have the keys of hell and of death." As I thought
   over these words, I marvelled for the poverty and meanness of the cause
   of evil; for the prince of it, the devil, has not the keys of his own
   house; he cannot be trusted with them; they are swinging at the girdle
   of Christ. Surely I shall never go to hell, for my Lord Jesus turned
   the key against my entrance long ago. The doors of hell were locked for
   me When He died on my behalf. I saw Him lock the door, and, what is
   more, I saw Him hang the key at His girdle, and there it is to this
   day. Christ has the keys of hell; then, whenever He chooses, He can
   cage the devouring lion, and restrain his power for evil. Oh, that the
   day were come! It is coming, for the dragon hath great wrath, knowing
   that his time is short. Let us not go forth alone to battle with this
   dread adversary; let us tell his Conqueror of him, and entreat Him to
   shorten his chain. I admire the forcible words of a dying woman to one
   who asked her what she did when she was tempted by the devil on account
   of her sin. She replied, "The devil does not tempt me now; he came to
   me a little while ago, and he does not like me well enough to come
   again!" "Why not?" "Well, he went away because I said to him, Chosen,
   chosen!" "What did you mean by that?" "Do you not remember how it is
   said in the Scripture, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord
   that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee'?" The aged woman's text was
   well taken, and well does the enemy know the rebuke which it contains.
   When Joshua, the high priest, clothed in filthy garments, stood before
   the angel, Satan stood at his right hand to resist him, but he was
   silenced by being told of the election of God: "The Lord which hath
   chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee." Ah, brethren, when Christ's right hand
   is upon us, the evil one departs! He knows too well the weight of that
   right hand.

   Conclude the verse,--"and of death." Our Lord has the keys of death,
   and this will be a joyful fact to us when our last hours arrive. If we
   say to Him, "Master, whither am I going?" He answers, "I have the key
   of death and the spirit world. Will we not reply, "We feel quite
   confident to go wherever Thou wilt lead us, O Lord"? We shall then
   pursue His track in His company. Our bodies shall descend into what men
   call a charnel-house, though it is really the unrobing-room of saints,
   the vestibule of heaven, the wardrobe of our dress where it shall be
   cleansed and perfected. We have a fit spiritual array for the interval,
   but we expect that our bodies shall rise again in the likeness of "the
   Lord from heaven." What gainers we shall be when we shall take up the
   robes we laid aside, and find them so gloriously changed, and made fit
   for us to wear even in the presence of our Lord! So, if the worst fear
   that crosses you should be realized, and you should literally die at
   your Lord's feet, there is no cause for dread, for no enemy can do you
   harm, since the divine right hand is pledged to deliver you to the end.
   Let us give the Well-beloved the most devout and fervent praise as we
   now partake of this regal festival. The King sitteth at His table, let
   our spikenard give forth its sweetest smell.

  (No. 939 in "Our Own Hymn Book.")


   AMIDST us our Belov'd stands,


   And bids us view His pierc'd hands;


   Points to His wounded feet and side,


   Blest emblems of the Crucified.


   What food luxurious loads the board,


   When at His table sits the Lord!


   The wine how rich, the bread how sweet,


   When Jesus deigns the guests to meet!


   If now with eyes defiled and dim,


   We see the signs but see not Him,


   Oh, may His love the scales displace,


   And bid us see Him face to face!


   Our former transports we recount,


   When with Him in the holy mount,


   These cause our souls to thirst anew,


   His marr'd but lovely face to view.


   Thou glorious Bridegroom of our hearts,


   Thy present smile a heaven imparts:


   Oh, lift the veil, if veil there be,


   Let every saint Thy beauties see!
