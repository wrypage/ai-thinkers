TO YOU

   HE WHO SPOKE and wrote this message will be greatly disappointed if it
   does not lead many to the Lord Jesus. It is sent forth in childlike
   dependence upon the power of God the Holy Ghost, to use it in the
   conversion of millions, if so He pleases. No doubt many poor men and
   women will take up this little volume, and the Lord will visit them
   with grace. To answer this end, the very plainest language has been
   chosen, and many homely expressions have been used. But if those of
   wealth and rank should glance at this book, the Holy Ghost can impress
   them also; since that which can be understood by the unlettered is none
   the less attractive to the instructed. Oh that some might read it who
   will become great winners of souls!

   Who knows how many will find their way to peace by what they read here?
   A more important question to you, dear reader, is this- -Will you be
   one of them?

   A certain man placed a fountain by the wayside, and he hung up a cup
   near to it by a little chain. He was told some time after that a great
   art-critic had found much fault with its design. "But," said he, "do
   many thirsty persons drink at it?" Then they told him that thousands of
   poor people, men, women, and children, slaked their thirst at this
   fountain; and he smiled and said, that he was little troubled by the
   critic's observation, only he hoped that on some sultry summer's day
   the critic himself might fill the cup, and he refreshed, and praise the
   name of the Lord.

   Here is my fountain, and here is my cup: find fault if you please; but
   do drink of the water of life. I only care for this. I had rather bless
   the soul of the poorest crossing-sweeper, or rag-gatherer, than please
   a prince of the blood, and fail to convert him to God.

   Reader, do you mean business in reading these pages? If so, we are
   agreed at the outset; but nothing short of your finding Christ and
   Heaven is the business aimed at here. Oh that we may seek this
   together! I do so by dedicating this little book with prayer. Will not
   you join me by looking up to God, and asking Him to bless you while you
   read? Providence has put these pages in your way, you have a little
   spare time in which to read them, and you feel willing to give your
   attention to them. These are good signs. Who knows but the set time of
   blessing is come for you? At any rate, "The Holy Ghost saith, Today, if
   ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."

WHAT ARE WE AT?

   I HEARD A STORY; I think it came from the North Country: A minister
   called upon a poor woman, intending to give her help; for he knew that
   she was very poor. With his money in his hand, he knocked at the door;
   but she did not answer. He concluded she was not at home, and went his
   way. A little after he met her at the church, and told her that he had
   remembered her need: "I called at your house, and knocked several
   times, and I suppose you were not at home, for I had no answer." "At
   what hour did you call, sir?" "It was about noon." "Oh, dear," she
   said, "I heard you, sir, and I am so sorry I did not answer; but I
   thought it was the man calling for the rent." Many a poor woman knows
   what this meant. Now, it is my desire to be heard, and therefore I want
   to say that I am not calling for the rent; indeed, it is not the object
   of this book to ask anything of you, but to tell you that salvation is
   all of grace, which means, free, gratis, for nothing.

   Oftentimes, when we are anxious to win attention, our hearer thinks,
   "Ah! now I am going to be told my duty. It is the man calling for that
   which is due to God, and I am sure I have nothing wherewith to pay. I
   will not be at home." No, this book does not come to make a demand upon
   you, but to bring you something. We are not going to talk about law,
   and duty, and punishment, but about love, and goodness, and
   forgiveness, and mercy, and eternal life. Do not, therefore, act as if
   you were not at home: do not turn a deaf ear, or a careless heart. I am
   asking nothing of you in the name of God or man. It is not my intent to
   make any requirement at your hands; but I come in God's name, to bring
   you a free gift, which it shall be to your present and eternal joy to
   receive. Open the door, and let my pleadings enter. "Come now, and let
   us reason together." The Lord himself invites you to a conference
   concerning your immediate and endless happiness, and He would not have
   done this if He did not mean well toward you. Do not refuse the Lord
   Jesus who knocks at your door; for He knocks with a hand which was
   nailed to the tree for such as you are. Since His only and sole object
   is your good, incline your ear and come to Him. Hearken diligently, and
   let the good word sink into your soul. It may be that the hour is come
   in which you shall enter upon that new life which is the beginning of
   heaven. Faith cometh by hearing, and reading is a sort of hearing:
   faith may come to you while you are reading this book. Why not? O
   blessed Spirit of all grace, make it so!

GOD JUSTIFIETH THE UNGODLY

   THIS MESSAGE is for you. You will find the text in the Epistle to the
   Romans, in the fourth chapter and the fifth verse:

   To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
   ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

   I call your attention to those words, "Him that justifieth the
   ungodly." They seem to me to be very wonderful words.

   Are you not surprised that there should be such an expression as that
   in the Bible, "That justifieth the ungodly?" I have heard that men that
   hate the doctrines of the cross bring it as a charge against God, that
   He saves wicked men and receives to Himself the vilest of the vile. See
   how this Scripture accepts the charge, and plainly states it! By the
   mouth of His servant Paul, by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, He
   takes to Himself the title of "Him that justifieth the ungodly." He
   makes those just who are unjust, forgives those who deserve to be
   punished, and favors those who deserve no favor. You thought, did you
   not, that salvation was for the good? that God's grace was for the pure
   and holy, who are free from sin? It has fallen into your mind that, if
   you were excellent, then God would reward you; and you have thought
   that because you are not worthy, therefore there could be no way of
   your enjoying His favor. You must be somewhat surprised to read a text
   like this: "Him that justifieth the ungodly." I do not wonder that you
   are surprised; for with all my familiarity with the great grace of God,
   I never cease to wonder at it. It does sound surprising, does it not,
   that it should be possible for a holy God to justify an unholy man? We,
   according to the natural legality of our hearts, are always talking
   about our own goodness and our own worthiness, and we stubbornly hold
   to it that there must be somewhat in us in order to win the notice of
   God. Now, God, who sees through all deceptions, knows that there is no
   goodness whatever in us. He says that "there is none righteous, no not
   one." He knows that "all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags," and,
   therefore the Lord Jesus did not come into the world to look after
   goodness and righteousness with him, and to bestow them upon persons
   who have none of them. He comes, not because we are just, but to make
   us so: he justifieth the ungodly.

   When a counsellor comes into court, if he is an honest man, he desires
   to plead the case of an innocent person and justify him before the
   court from the things which are falsely laid to his charge. It should
   be the lawyer's object to justify the innocent person, and he should
   not attempt to screen the guilty party. It lies not in man's right nor
   in man's power truly to justify the guilty. This is a miracle reserved
   for the Lord alone. God, the infinitely just Sovereign, knows that
   there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not, and
   therefore, in the infinite sovereignty of His divine nature and in the
   splendor of His ineffable love, He undertakes the task, not so much of
   justifying the just as of justifying the ungodly. God has devised ways
   and means of making the ungodly man to stand justly accepted before
   Him: He has set up a system by which with perfect justice He can treat
   the guilty as if he had been all his life free from offence, yea, can
   treat him as if he were wholly free from sin. He justifieth the
   ungodly.

   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. It is a very
   surprising thing--a thing to be marveled at most of all by those who
   enjoy it. I know that it is to me even to this day the greatest wonder
   that I ever heard of, that God should ever justify me. I feel myself to
   be a lump of unworthiness, a mass of corruption, and a heap of sin,
   apart from His almighty love. I know by a full assurance that I am
   justified by faith which is in Christ Jesus, and treated as if I had
   been perfectly just, and made an heir of God and a joint heir with
   Christ; and yet by nature I must take my place among the most sinful.
   I, who am altogether undeserving, am treated as if I had been
   deserving. I am loved with as much love as if I had always been godly,
   whereas aforetime I was ungodly. Who can help being astonished at this?
   Gratitude for such favor stands dressed in robes of wonder.

   Now, while this is very surprising, I want you to notice how available
   it makes the gospel to you and to me. If God justifieth the ungodly,
   then, dear friend, He can justify you. Is not that the very kind of
   person that you are? If you are unconverted at this moment, it is a
   very proper description of you; you have lived without God, you have
   been the reverse of godly; in one word, you have been and are ungodly.
   Perhaps you have not even attended a place of worship on Sunday, but
   have lived in disregard of God's day, and house, and Word--this proves
   you to have been ungodly. Sadder still, it may be you have even tried
   to doubt God's existence, and have gone the length of saying that you
   did so. You have lived on this fair earth, which is full of the tokens
   of God's presence, and all the while you have shut your eyes to the
   clear evidences of His power and Godhead. You have lived as if there
   were no God. Indeed, you would have been very pleased if you could have
   demonstrated to yourself to a certainty that there was no God whatever.
   Possibly you have lived a great many years in this way, so that you are
   now pretty well settled in your ways, and yet God is not in any of
   them. If you were labeled

   UNGODLY

   it would as well describe you as if the sea were to be labeled salt
   water. Would it not?

   Possibly you are a person of another sort; you have regularly attended
   to all the outward forms of religion, and yet you have had no heart in
   them at all, but have been really ungodly. Though meeting with the
   people of God, you have never met with God for yourself; you have been
   in the choir, and yet have not praised the Lord with your heart. You
   have lived without any love to God in your heart, or regard to his
   commands in your life. Well, you are just the kind of man to whom this
   gospel is sent--this gospel which says that God justifieth the ungodly.
   It is very wonderful, but it is happily available for you. It just
   suits you. Does it not? How I wish that you would accept it! If you are
   a sensible man, you will see the remarkable grace of God in providing
   for such as you are, and you will say to yourself, "Justify the
   ungodly! Why, then, should not I be justified, and justified at once?"

   Now, observe further, that it must be so--that the salvation of God is
   for those who do not deserve it, and have no preparation for it. It is
   reasonable that the statement should be put in the Bible; for, dear
   friend, no others need justifying but those who have no justification
   of their own. If any of my readers are perfectly righteous, they want
   no justifying. You feel that you are doing your duty well, and almost
   putting heaven under an obligation to you. What do you want with a
   Saviour, or with mercy? What do you want with justification? You will
   be tired of my book by this time, for it will have no interest to you.

   If any of you are giving yourselves such proud airs, listen to me for a
   little while. You will be lost, as sure as you are alive. You righteous
   men, whose righteousness is all of your own working, are either
   deceivers or deceived; for the Scripture cannot lie, and it saith
   plainly, "There is none righteous, no, not one." In any case I have no
   gospel to preach to the self- righteous, no, not a word of it. Jesus
   Christ himself came not to call the righteous, and I am not going to do
   what He did not do. If I called you, you would not come, and,
   therefore, I will not call you, under that character. No, I bid you
   rather look at that righteousness of yours till you see what a delusion
   it is. It is not half so substantial as a cobweb. Have done with it!
   Flee from it! Oh believe that the only persons that can need
   justification are those who are not in themselves just! They need that
   something should be done for them to make them just before the judgment
   seat of God. Depend upon it, the Lord only does that which is needful.
   Infinite wisdom never attempts that which is unnecessary. Jesus never
   undertakes that which is superfluous. To make him just who is just is
   no work for God--that were a labor for a fool; but to make him just who
   is unjust--that is work for infinite love and mercy. To justify the
   ungodly--this is a miracle worthy of a God. And for certain it is so.

   Now, look. If there be anywhere in the world a physician who has
   discovered sure and precious remedies, to whom is that physician sent?
   To those who are perfectly healthy? I think not. Put him down in a
   district where there are no sick persons, and he feels that he is not
   in his place. There is nothing for him to do. "The whole have no need
   of a physician, but they that are sick." Is it not equally clear that
   the great remedies of grace and redemption are for the sick in soul?
   They cannot be for the whole, for they cannot be of use to such. If
   you, dear friend, feel that you are spiritually sick, the Physician has
   come into the world for you. If you are altogether undone by reason of
   your sin, you are the very person aimed at in the plan of salvation. I
   say that the Lord of love had just such as you are in His eye when He
   arranged the system of grace. Suppose a man of generous spirit were to
   resolve to forgive all those who were indebted to him; it is clear that
   this can only apply to those really in his debt. One person owes him a
   thousand pounds; another owes him fifty pounds; each one has but to
   have his bill receipted, and the liability is wiped out. But the most
   generous person cannot forgive the debts of those who do not owe him
   anything. It is out of the power of Omnipotence to forgive where there
   is no sin. Pardon, therefore, cannot be for you who have no sin. Pardon
   must be for the guilty. Forgiveness must be for the sinful. It were
   absurd to talk of forgiving those who do not need forgiveness--
   pardoning those who have never offended.

   Do you think that you must be lost because you are a sinner? This is
   the reason why you can be saved. Because you own yourself to be a
   sinner I would encourage you to believe that grace is ordained for such
   as you are. One of our hymn-writers even dared to say:

     A sinner is a sacred thing;
     The Holy Ghost hath made him so.

   It is truly so, that Jesus seeks and saves that which is lost. He died
   and made a real atonement for real sinners. When men are not playing
   with words, or calling themselves "miserable sinners," out of mere
   compliment, I feel overjoyed to meet with them. I would be glad to talk
   all night to bona fide sinners. The inn of mercy never closes its doors
   upon such, neither weekdays nor Sunday. Our Lord Jesus did not die for
   imaginary sins, but His heart's blood was spilt to wash out deep
   crimson stains, which nothing else can remove.

   He that is a black sinner--he is the kind of man that Jesus Christ came
   to make white. A gospel preacher on one occasion preached a sermon
   from, "Now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees," and he
   delivered such a sermon that one of his hearers said to him, "One would
   have thought that you had been preaching to criminals. Your sermon
   ought to have been delivered in the county jail." "Oh, no," said the
   good man, "if I were preaching in the county jail, I should not preach
   from that text, there I should preach 'This is a faithful saying, and
   worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners.'" Just so. The law is for the self-righteous, to humble
   their pride: the gospel is for the lost, to remove their despair.

   If you are not lost, what do you want with a Saviour? Should the
   shepherd go after those who never went astray? Why should the woman
   sweep her house for the bits of money that were never out of her purse?
   No, the medicine is for the diseased; the quickening is for the dead;
   the pardon is for the guilty; liberation is for those who are bound:
   the opening of eyes is for those who are blind. How can the Saviour,
   and His death upon the cross, and the gospel of pardon, be accounted
   for, unless it be upon the supposition that men are guilty and worthy
   of condemnation? The sinner is the gospel's reason for existence. You,
   my friend, to whom this word now comes, if you are undeserving,
   ill-deserving, hell-deserving, you are the sort of man for whom the
   gospel is ordained, and arranged, and proclaimed. God justifieth the
   ungodly.

   I would like to make this very plain. I hope that I have done so
   already; but still, plain as it is, it is only the Lord that can make a
   man see it. It does at first seem most amazing to an awakened man that
   salvation should really be for him as a lost and guilty one. He thinks
   that it must be for him as a penitent man, forgetting that his
   penitence is a part of his salvation. "Oh," says he, "but I must be
   this and that,"--all of which is true, for he shall be this and that as
   the result of salvation; but salvation comes to him before he has any
   of the results of salvation. It comes to him, in fact, while he
   deserves only this bare, beggarly, base, abominable description,
   "ungodly." That is all he is when God's gospel comes to justify him.

   May I, therefore, urge upon any who have no good thing about them--who
   fear that they have not even a good feeling, or anything whatever that
   can recommend them to God--that they will firmly believe that our
   gracious God is able and willing to take them without anything to
   recommend them, and to forgive them spontaneously, not because they are
   good, but because He is good. Does He not make His sun to shine on the
   evil as well as on the good? Does He not give fruitful seasons, and
   send the rain and the sunshine in their time upon the most ungodly
   nations? Ay, even Sodom had its sun, and Gomorrah had its dew. Oh
   friend, the great grace of God surpasses my conception and your
   conception, and I would have you think worthily of it! As high as the
   heavens are above the earth; so high are God's thoughts above our
   thoughts. He can abundantly pardon. Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners: forgiveness is for the guilty.

   Do not attempt to touch yourself up and make yourself something other
   than you really are; but come as you are to Him who justifies the
   ungodly. A great artist some short time ago had painted a part of the
   corporation of the city in which he lived, and he wanted, for historic
   purposes, to include in his picture certain characters well known in
   the town. A crossing-sweeper, unkempt, ragged, filthy, was known to
   everybody, and there was a suitable place for him in the picture. The
   artist said to this ragged and rugged individual, "I will pay you well
   if you will come down to my studio and let me take your likeness." He
   came round in the morning, but he was soon sent about his business; for
   he had washed his face, and combed his hair, and donned a respectable
   suit of clothes. He was needed as a beggar, and was not invited in any
   other capacity. Even so, the gospel will receive you into its halls if
   you come as a sinner, not otherwise. Wait not for reformation, but come
   at once for salvation. God justifieth the ungodly, and that takes you
   up where you now are: it meets you in your worst estate.

   Come in your deshabille. I mean, come to your heavenly Father in all
   your sin and sinfulness. Come to Jesus just as you are, leprous,
   filthy, naked, neither fit to live nor fit to die. Come, you that are
   the very sweepings of creation; come, though you hardly dare to hope
   for anything but death. Come, though despair is brooding over you,
   pressing upon your bosom like a horrible nightmare. Come and ask the
   Lord to justify another ungodly one. Why should He not? Come for this
   great mercy of God is meant for such as you are. I put it in the
   language of the text, and I cannot put it more strongly: the Lord God
   Himself takes to Himself this gracious title, "Him that justifieth the
   ungodly." He makes just, and causes to be treated as just, those who by
   nature are ungodly. Is not that a wonderful word for you? Reader, do
   not delay till you have well considered this matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

"IT IS GOD THAT JUSTIFIETH"

   Romans 8:33

   A WONDERFUL THING it is, this being justified, or made just. If we had
   never broken the laws of God we should not have needed it, for we
   should have been just in ourselves. He who has all his life done the
   things which he ought to have done, and has never done anything which
   he ought not to have done, is justified by the law. But you, dear
   reader, are not of that sort, I am quite sure. You have too much
   honesty to pretend to be without sin, and therefore you need to be
   justified.

   Now, if you justify yourself, you will simply be a self- deceiver.
   Therefore do not attempt it. It is never worth while.

   If you ask your fellow mortals to justify you, what can they do? You
   can make some of them speak well of you for small favors, and others
   will backbite you for less. Their judgment is not worth much.

   Our text says, "It is God that justifieth," and this is a deal more to
   the point. It is an astonishing fact, and one that we ought to consider
   with care. Come and see.

   In the first place, nobody else but God would ever have thought of
   justifying those who are guilty. They have lived in open rebellion;
   they have done evil with both hands; they have gone from bad to worse;
   they have turned back to sin even after they have smarted for it, and
   have therefore for a while been forced to leave it. They have broken
   the law, and trampled on the gospel. They have refused proclamations of
   mercy, and have persisted in ungodliness. How can they be forgiven and
   justified? Their fellowmen, despairing of them, say, "They are hopeless
   cases." Even Christians look upon them with sorrow rather than with
   hope. But not so their God. He, in the splendor of his electing grace
   having chosen some of them before the foundation of the world, will not
   rest till He has justified them, and made them to be accepted in the
   Beloved. Is it not written, "Whom he did predestinate, them he also
   called: and whom he called them he also justified: and whom he
   justified, them he also glorified"? Thus you see there are some whom
   the Lord resolves to justify: why should not you and I be of the
   number?

   None but God would ever have thought of justifying me. I am a wonder to
   myself. I doubt not that grace is equally seen in others. Look at Saul
   of Tarsus, who foamed at the mouth, against God's servants. Like a
   hungry wolf, he worried the lambs and the sheep right and left; and yet
   God struck him down on the road to Damascus, and changed his heart, and
   so fully justified him that ere long, this man became the greatest
   preacher of justification by faith that ever lived. He must often have
   marveled that he was justified by faith in Christ Jesus; for he was
   once a determined stickler for salvation by the works of the law. None
   but God would have ever thought of justifying such a man as Saul the
   persecutor; but the Lord God is glorious in grace.

   But, even if anybody had thought of justifying the ungodly, none but
   God could have done it. It is quite impossible for any person to
   forgive offences which have not been committed against himself. A
   person has greatly injured you; you can forgive him, and I hope you
   will; but no third person can forgive him apart from you. If the wrong
   is done to you, the pardon must come from you. If we have sinned
   against God, it is in God's power to forgive; for the sin is against
   Himself. That is why David says, in the fifty-first Psalm: "Against
   thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight"; for
   then God, against whom the offence is committed, can put the offence
   away. That which we owe to God, our great Creator can remit, if so it
   pleases Him; and if He remits it, it is remitted. None but the great
   God, against whom we have committed the sin, can blot out that sin; let
   us, therefore, see that we go to Him and seek mercy at His hands. Do
   not let us be led aside by those who would have us confess to them;
   they have no warrant in the Word of God for their pretensions. But even
   if they were ordained to pronounce absolution in God's name, it must
   still be better to go ourselves to the great Lord through Jesus Christ,
   the Mediator, and seek and find pardon at His hand; since we are sure
   that this is the right way. Proxy religion involves too great a risk:
   you had better see to your soul's matters yourself, and leave them in
   no man's hands.

   Only God can justify the ungodly; but He can do it to perfection. He
   casts our sins behind His back, He blots them out; He says that though
   they be sought for, they shall not be found. With no other reason for
   it but His own infinite goodness, He has prepared a glorious way by
   which He can make scarlet sins as white as snow, and remove our
   transgressions from us as far as the east is from the west. He says, "I
   will not remember your sins." He goes the length of making an end of
   sin. One of old called out in amazement, "Who is a God like unto thee,
   that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the
   remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because
   he delighteth in mercy" (Micah 7:18 ).

   We are not now speaking of justice, nor of God's dealing with men
   according to their deserts. If you profess to deal with the righteous
   Lord on law terms, everlasting wrath threatens you, for that is what
   you deserve. Blessed be His name, He has not dealt with us after our
   sins; but now He treats with us on terms of free grace and infinite
   compassion, and He says, "I will receive you graciously, and love you
   freely." Believe it, for it is certainly true that the great God is
   able to treat the guilty with abundant mercy; yea, He is able to treat
   the ungodly as if they had been always godly. Read carefully the
   parable of the prodigal son, and see how the forgiving father received
   the returning wanderer with as much love as if he had never gone away,
   and had never defiled himself with harlots. So far did he carry this
   that the elder brother began to grumble at it; but the father never
   withdrew his love. Oh my brother, however guilty you may be, if you
   will only come back to your God and Father, He will treat you as if you
   had never done wrong! He will regard you as just, and deal with you
   accordingly. What say you to this?

   Do you not see--for I want to bring this out clearly, what a splendid
   thing it is--that as none but God would think of justifying the
   ungodly, and none but God could do it, yet the Lord can do it? See how
   the apostle puts the challenge, "Who shall lay anything to the charge
   of God's elect? It is God that justifieth." If God has justified a man
   it is well done, it is rightly done, it is justly done, it is
   everlastingly done. I read a statement in a magazine which is full of
   venom against the gospel and those who preach it, that we hold some
   kind of theory by which we imagine that sin can be removed from men. We
   hold no theory, we publish a fact. The grandest fact under heaven is
   this- -that Christ by His precious blood does actually put away sin,
   and that God, for Christ's sake, dealing with men on terms of divine
   mercy, forgives the guilty and justifies them, not according to
   anything that He sees in them, or foresees will be in them, but
   according to the riches of His mercy which lie in His own heart. This
   we have preached, do preach, and will preach as long as we live. "It is
   God that justifieth"--that justifieth the ungodly; He is not ashamed of
   doing it, nor are we of preaching it.

   The justification which comes from God himself must be beyond question.
   If the Judge acquits me, who can condemn me? If the highest court in
   the universe has pronounced me just, who shall lay anything to my
   charge? Justification from God is a sufficient answer to an awakened
   conscience. The Holy Spirit by its means breathes peace over our entire
   nature, and we are no longer afraid. With this justification we can
   answer all the roarings and railings of Satan and ungodly men. With
   this we shall be able to die: with this we shall boldly rise again, and
   face the last great assize.

     Bold shall I stand in that great day,
     For who aught to my charge shall lay?
     While by my Lord absolved I am
     From sin's tremendous curse and blame.

   Friend, the Lord can blot out all your sins. I make no shot in the dark
   when I say this. "All manner of sin and of blasphemy shall be forgiven
   unto men." Though you are steeped up to your throat in crime, He can
   with a word remove the defilement, and say, "I will, be thou clean."
   The Lord is a great forgiver.

   "I believe in the Forgiveness of Sins." Do You?

   He can even at this hour pronounce the sentence, "Thy sins be forgiven
   thee; go in peace;" and if He do this, no power in Heaven, or earth, or
   under the earth, can put you under suspicion, much less under wrath. Do
   not doubt the power of Almighty love. You could not forgive your fellow
   man had he offended you as you have offended God; but you must not
   measure God's corn with your bushel; His thoughts and ways are as much
   above yours as the heavens are high above the earth.

   "Well," say you, "it would be a great miracle if the Lord were to
   pardon me." Just so. It would be a supreme miracle, and therefore He is
   likely to do it; for He does "great things and unsearchable" which we
   looked not for.

   I was myself stricken down with a horrible sense of guilt, which made
   my life a misery to me; but when I heard the command, "Look unto me,
   and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is
   none else"--I looked, and in a moment the Lord justified me. Jesus
   Christ, made sin for me, was what I saw, and that sight gave me rest.
   When those who were bitten by the fiery serpents in the wilderness
   looked to the serpent of brass they were healed at once; and so was I
   when I looked to the crucified Saviour. The Holy Spirit, who enabled me
   to believe, gave me peace through believing. I felt as sure that I was
   forgiven, as before I felt sure of condemnation. I had been certain of
   my condemnation because the Word of God declared it, and my conscience
   bore witness to it; but when the Lord justified me I was made equally
   certain by the same witnesses. The word of the Lord in the Scripture
   saith, "He that believeth on him is not condemned," and my conscience
   bears witness that I believed, and that God in pardoning me is just.
   Thus I have the witness of the Holy Spirit and my own conscience, and
   these two agree in one. Oh, how I wish that my reader would receive the
   testimony of God upon this matter, and then full soon he would also
   have the witness in himself!

   I venture to say that a sinner justified by God stands on even a surer
   footing than a righteous man justified by his works, if such there be.
   We could never be surer that we had done enough works; conscience would
   always be uneasy lest, after all, we should come short, and we could
   only have the trembling verdict of a fallible judgment to rely upon;
   but when God himself justifies, and the Holy Spirit bears witness
   thereto by giving us peace with God, why then we feel that the matter
   is sure and settled, and we enter into rest. No tongue can tell the
   depth of that calm which comes over the soul which has received the
   peace of God which passeth all understanding.

JUST AND THE JUSTIFIER

   WE HAVE SEEN the ungodly justified, and have considered the great
   truth, that only God can justify any man; we now come a step further
   and make the inquiry--How can a just God justify guilty men? Here we
   are met with a full answer in the words of Paul, in Romans 3:21-26. We
   will read six verses from the chapter so as to get the run of the
   passage:

   "But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being
   witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God
   which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that
   believe: for there is no difference; for all have sinned, and come
   short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through
   the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a
   propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
   for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
   God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness; that he might
   be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."

   Here suffer me to give you a bit of personal experience. When I was
   under the hand of the Holy Spirit, under conviction of sin, I had a
   clear and sharp sense of the justice of God. Sin, whatever it might be
   to other people, became to me an intolerable burden. It was not so much
   that I feared hell, but that I feared sin. I knew myself to be so
   horribly guilty that I remember feeling that if God did not punish me
   for sin He ought to do so. I felt that the Judge of all the earth ought
   to condemn such sin as mine. I sat on the judgment seat, and I
   condemned myself to perish; for I confessed that had I been God I could
   have done no other than send such a guilty creature as I was down to
   the lowest hell. All the while, I had upon my mind a deep concern for
   the honor of God's name, and the integrity of His moral government. I
   felt that it would not satisfy my conscience if I could be forgiven
   unjustly. The sin I had committed must be punished. But then there was
   the question how God could be just, and yet justify me who had been so
   guilty. I asked my heart: "How can He be just and yet the justifier?" I
   was worried and wearied with this question; neither could I see any
   answer to it. Certainly, I could never have invented an answer which
   would have satisfied my conscience.

   The doctrine of the atonement is to my mind one of the surest proofs of
   the divine inspiration of Holy Scripture. Who would or could have
   thought of the just Ruler dying for the unjust rebel? This is no
   teaching of human mythology, or dream of poetical imagination. This
   method of expiation is only known among men because it is a fact;
   fiction could not have devised it. God Himself ordained it; it is not a
   matter which could have been imagined.

   I had heard the plan of salvation by the sacrifice of Jesus from my
   youth up; but I did not know any more about it in my innermost soul
   than if I had been born and bred a Hottentot. The light was there, but
   I was blind; it was of necessity that the Lord himself should make the
   matter plain to me. It came to me as a new revelation, as fresh as if I
   had never read in Scripture that Jesus was declared to be the
   propitiation for sins that God might be just. I believe it will have to
   come as a revelation to every newborn child of God whenever he sees it;
   I mean that glorious doctrine of the substitution of the Lord Jesus. I
   came to understand that salvation was possible through vicarious
   sacrifice; and that provision had been made in the first constitution
   and arrangement of things for such a substitution. I was made to see
   that He who is the Son of God, co-equal, and co- eternal with the
   Father, had of old been made the covenant Head of a chosen people that
   He might in that capacity suffer for them and save them. Inasmuch as
   our fall was not at the first a personal one, for we fell in our
   federal representative, the first Adam, it became possible for us to be
   recovered by a second representative, even by Him who has undertaken to
   be the covenant head of His people, so as to be their second Adam. I
   saw that ere I actually sinned I had fallen by my first father's sin;
   and I rejoiced that therefore it became possible in point of law for me
   to rise by a second head and representative. The fall by Adam left a
   loophole of escape; another Adam can undo the ruin made by the first.
   When I was anxious about the possibility of a just God pardoning me, I
   understood and saw by faith that He who is the Son of God became man,
   and in His own blessed person bore my sin in His own body on the tree.
   I saw the chastisement of my peace was laid on Him, and that with His
   stripes I was healed. Dear friend, have you ever seen that? Have you
   ever understood how God can be just to the full, not remitting penalty
   nor blunting the edge of the sword, and yet can be infinitely merciful,
   and can justify the ungodly who turn to Him? It was because the Son of
   God, supremely glorious in His matchless person, undertook to vindicate
   the law by bearing the sentence due to me, that therefore God is able
   to pass by my sin. The law of God was more vindicated by the death of
   Christ than it would have been had all transgressors been sent to Hell.
   For the Son of God to suffer for sin was a more glorious establishment
   of the government of God, than for the whole race to suffer.

   Jesus has borne the death penalty on our behalf. Behold the wonder!
   There He hangs upon the cross! This is the greatest sight you will ever
   see. Son of God and Son of Man, there He hangs, bearing pains
   unutterable, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God. Oh, the glory
   of that sight! The innocent punished! The Holy One condemned! The
   Ever-blessed made a curse! The infinitely glorious put to a shameful
   death! The more I look at the sufferings of the Son of God, the more
   sure I am that they must meet my case. Why did He suffer, if not to
   turn aside the penalty from us? If, then, He turned it aside by His
   death, it is turned aside, and those who believe in Him need not fear
   it. It must be so, that since expiation is made, God is able to forgive
   without shaking the basis of His throne, or in the least degree
   blotting the statute book. Conscience gets a full answer to her
   tremendous question. The wrath of God against iniquity, whatever that
   may be, must be beyond all conception terrible. Well did Moses say,
   "Who knoweth the power of thine anger?" Yet when we hear the Lord of
   glory cry, "Why hast thou forsaken me?" and see Him yielding up the
   ghost, we feel that the justice of God has received abundant
   vindication by obedience so perfect and death so terrible, rendered by
   so divine a person. If God himself bows before His own law, what more
   can be done? There is more in the atonement by way of merit, than there
   is in all human sin by way of demerit.

   The great gulf of Jesus' loving self-sacrifice can swallow up the
   mountains of our sins, all of them. For the sake of the infinite good
   of this one representative man, the Lord may well look with favor upon
   other men, however unworthy they may be in and of themselves. It was a
   miracle of miracles that the Lord Jesus Christ should stand in our
   stead and

     Bear that we might never bear
     His Father's righteous ire.

   But he has done so. "It is finished." God will spare the sinner because
   He did not spare His Son. God can pass by your transgressions because
   He laid those transgressions upon His only begotten Son nearly two
   thousand years ago. If you believe in Jesus (that is the point), then
   your sins were carried away by Him who was the scapegoat for His
   people.

   What is it to believe in Him? It is not merely to say, "He is God and
   the Saviour," but to trust Him wholly and entirely, and take Him for
   all your salvation from this time forth and forever--your Lord, your
   Master, your all. If you will have Jesus, He has you already. If you
   believe on Him, I tell you you cannot go to hell; for that were to make
   the sacrifice of Christ of none effect. It cannot be that a sacrifice
   should be accepted, and yet the soul should die for whom that sacrifice
   has been received. If the believing soul could be condemned, then why a
   sacrifice? If Jesus died in my stead, why should I die also? Every
   believer can claim that the sacrifice was actually made for him: by
   faith he has laid his hands on it, and made it his own, and therefore
   he may rest assured that he can never perish. The Lord would not
   receive this offering on our behalf, and then condemn us to die. The
   Lord cannot read our pardon written in the blood of His own Son, and
   then smite us. That were impossible. Oh that you may have grace given
   you at once to look away to Jesus and to begin at the beginning, even
   at Jesus, who is the Fountain- head of mercy to guilty man!

   "He justifieth the ungodly." "It is God that justifieth," therefore,
   and for that reason only it can be done, and He does it through the
   atoning sacrifice of His divine Son. Therefore it can be justly
   done--so justly done that none will ever question it--so thoroughly
   done that in the last tremendous day, when heaven and earth shall pass
   away, there shall be none that shall deny the validity of the
   justification. "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died. Who
   shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifieth."

   Now, poor soul! will you come into this lifeboat, just as you are? Here
   is safety from the wreck! Accept the sure deliverance. "I have nothing
   with me," say you. You are not asked to bring anything with you. Men
   who escape for their lives will leave even their clothes behind. Leap
   for it, just as you are.

   I will tell you this thing about myself to encourage you. My sole hope
   for heaven lies in the full atonement made upon Calvary's cross for the
   ungodly. On that I firmly rely. I have not the shadow of a hope
   anywhere else. You are in the same condition as I am; for we neither of
   us have anything of our own worth as a ground of trust. Let us join
   hands and stand together at the foot of the cross, and trust our souls
   once for all to Him who shed His blood for the guilty. We will be saved
   by one and the same Saviour. If you perish trusting Him, I must perish
   too. What can I do more to prove my own confidence in the gospel which
   I set before you?
     __________________________________________________________________

CONCERNING DELIVERANCE FROM SINNING

   IN THIS PLACE I would say a plain word or two to those who understand
   the method of justification by faith which is in Christ Jesus, but
   whose trouble is that they cannot cease from sin. We can never be
   happy, restful, or spiritually healthy till we become holy. We must be
   rid of sin; but how is the riddance to be wrought? This is the
   life-or-death question of many. The old nature is very strong, and they
   have tried to curb and tame it; but it will not be subdued, and they
   find themselves, though anxious to be better, if anything growing worse
   than before. The heart is so hard, the will is so obstinate, the
   passions are so furious, the thoughts are so volatile, the imagination
   is so ungovernable, the desires are so wild, that the man feels that he
   has a den of wild beasts within him, which will eat him up sooner than
   be ruled by him. We may say of our fallen nature what the Lord said to
   Job concerning Leviathan: "Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or
   wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?" A man might as well hope to hold
   the north wind in the hollow of his hand as expect to control by his
   own strength those boisterous powers which dwell within his fallen
   nature. This is a greater feat than any of the fabled labors of
   Hercules: God is wanted here.

   "I could believe that Jesus would forgive sin," says one, "but then my
   trouble is that I sin again, and that I feel such awful tendencies to
   evil within me. As surely as a stone, if it be flung up into the air,
   soon comes down again to the ground, so do I, though I am sent up to
   heaven by earnest preaching, return again to my insensible state. Alas!
   I am easily fascinated with the basilisk eyes of sin, and am thus held
   as under a spell, so that I cannot escape from my own folly."

   Dear friend, salvation would be a sadly incomplete affair if it did not
   deal with this part of our ruined estate. We want to be purified as
   well as pardoned. Justification without sanctification would not be
   salvation at all. It would call the leper clean, and leave him to die
   of his disease; if would forgive the rebellion and allow the rebel to
   remain an enemy to his king. It would remove the consequences but
   overlook the cause, and this would leave an endless and hopeless task
   before us. It would stop the stream for a time, but leave an open
   fountain of defilement, which would sooner or later break forth with
   increased power. Remember that the Lord Jesus came to take away sin in
   three ways; He came to remove the penalty of sin, the power of sin,
   and, at last, the presence of sin. At once you may reach to the second
   part--the power of sin may immediately be broken; and so you will be on
   the road to the third, namely, the removal of the presence of sin. "We
   know that he was manifested to take away our sins."

   The angel said of our Lord, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
   shall save his people from their sins." Our Lord Jesus came to destroy
   in us the works of the devil. That which was said at our Lord's birth
   was also declared in His death; for when the soldier pierced His side
   forthwith came there out blood and water, to set forth the double cure
   by which we are delivered from the guilt and the defilement of sin.

   If, however, you are troubled about the power of sin, and about the
   tendencies of your nature, as you well may be, here is a promise for
   you. Have faith in it, for it stands in that covenant of grace which is
   ordered in all things and sure. God, who cannot lie, has said in
   Ezekiel 36:26:

   A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
   you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will
   give you an heart of flesh.

   You see, it is all "I will," and "I will." "I will give," and "I will
   take away." This is the royal style of the King of kings, who is able
   to accomplish all His will. No word of His shall ever fall to the
   ground.

   The Lord knows right well that you cannot change your own heart, and
   cannot cleanse your own nature; but He also knows that He can do both.
   He can cause the Ethiopian to change his skin, and the leopard his
   spots. Hear this, and be astonished: He can create you a second time;
   He can cause you to be born again. This is a miracle of grace, but the
   Holy Ghost will perform it. It would be a very wonderful thing if one
   could stand at the foot of the Niagara Falls, and could speak a word
   which should make the river Niagara begin to run up stream, and leap up
   that great precipice over which it now rolls in stupendous force.
   Nothing but the power of God could achieve that marvel; but that would
   be more than a fit parallel to what would take place if the course of
   your nature were altogether reversed. All things are possible with God.
   He can reverse the direction of your desires and the current of your
   life, and instead of going downward from God, He can make your whole
   being tend upward toward God. That is, in fact, what the Lord has
   promised to do for all who are in the covenant; and we know from
   Scripture that all believers are in the covenant. Let me read the words
   again:

   A new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony
   heart out of your flesh, and will give an heart of flesh. (Ezekiel
   11:19).

   What a wonderful promise! And it is yea and amen in Christ Jesus to the
   glory of God by us. Let us lay hold of it; accept it as true, and
   appropriate it to ourselves. Then shall it be fulfilled in us, and we
   shall have, in after days and years, to sing of that wondrous change
   which the sovereign grace of God has wrought in us.

   It is well worthy of consideration that when the Lord takes away the
   stony heart, that deed is done; and when that is once done, no known
   power can ever take away that new heart which He gives, and that right
   spirit which He puts within us. "The gifts and calling of God are
   without repentance"; that is, without repentance on His part; He does
   not take away what He once has given. Let Him renew you and you will be
   renewed. Man's reformations and cleanings up soon come to an end, for
   the dog returns to his vomit; but when God puts a new heart into us,
   the new heart is there forever, and never will it harden into stone
   again. He who made it flesh will keep it so. Herein we may rejoice and
   be glad forever in that which God creates in the kingdom of His grace.

   To put the matter very simply--did you ever hear of Mr. Rowland Hill's
   illustration of the cat and the sow? I will give it in my own fashion,
   to illustrate our Saviour's expressive words--"Ye must be born again."
   Do you see that cat? What a cleanly creature she is! How cleverly she
   washes herself with her tongue and her paws! It is quite a pretty
   sight! Did you ever see a sow do that? No, you never did. It is
   contrary to its nature. It prefers to wallow in the mire. Go and teach
   a sow to wash itself, and see how little success you would gain. It
   would be a great sanitary improvement if swine would be clean. Teach
   them to wash and clean themselves as the cat has been doing! Useless
   task. You may by force wash that sow, but it hastens to the mire, and
   is soon as foul as ever. The only way in which you can get a sow to
   wash itself is to transform it into a cat; then it will wash and be
   clean, but not till then! Suppose that transformation to be
   accomplished, and then what was difficult or impossible is easy enough;
   the swine will henceforth be fit for your parlor and your hearth-rug.
   So it is with an ungodly man; you cannot force him to do what a renewed
   man does most willingly; you may teach him, and set him a good example,
   but he cannot learn the art of holiness, for he has no mind to it; his
   nature leads him another way. When the Lord makes a new man of him,
   then all things wear a different aspect. So great is this change, that
   I once heard a convert say, "Either all the world is changed, or else I
   am." The new nature follows after right as naturally as the old nature
   wanders after wrong. What a blessing to receive such a nature! Only the
   Holy Ghost can give it.

   Did it ever strike you what a wonderful thing it is for the Lord to
   give a new heart and a right spirit to a man? You have seen a lobster,
   perhaps, which has fought with another lobster, and lost one of its
   claws, and a new claw has grown. That is a remarkable thing; but it is
   a much more astounding fact that a man should have a new heart given to
   him. This, indeed, is a miracle beyond the powers of nature. There is a
   tree. If you cut off one of its limbs, another one may grow in its
   place; but can you change the tree; can you sweeten sour sap; can you
   make the thorn bear figs? You can graft something better into it and
   that is the analogy which nature gives us of the work of grace; but
   absolutely to change the vital sap of the tree would be a miracle
   indeed. Such a prodigy and mystery of power God works in all who
   believe in Jesus.

   If you yield yourself up to His divine working, the Lord will alter
   your nature; He will subdue the old nature, and breathe new life into
   you. Put your trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and He will take the
   stony heart out of your flesh, and He will give you a heart of flesh.
   Where everything was hard, everything shall be tender; where everything
   was vicious, everything shall be virtuous: where everything tended
   downward, everything shall rise upward with impetuous force. The lion
   of anger shall give place to the lamb of meekness; the raven of
   uncleanness shall fly before the dove of purity; the vile serpent of
   deceit shall be trodden under the heel of truth.

   I have seen with my own eyes such marvellous changes of moral and
   spiritual character that I despair of none. I could, if it were
   fitting, point out those who were once unchaste women who are now pure
   as the driven snow, and blaspheming men who now delight all around them
   by their intense devotion. Thieves are made honest, drunkards sober,
   liars truthful, and scoffers zealous. Wherever the grace of God has
   appeared to a man it has trained him to deny ungodliness and worldly
   lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present evil
   world: and, dear reader, it will do the same for you.

   "I cannot make this change," says one. Who said you could? The
   Scripture which we have quoted speaks not of what man will do, but of
   what God will do. It is God's promise, and it is for Him to fulfill His
   own engagements. Trust in Him to fulfill His Word to you, and it will
   be done.

   "But how is it to be done?" What business is that of yours? Must the
   Lord explain His methods before you will believe him? The Lord's
   working in this matter is a great mystery: the Holy Ghost performs it.
   He who made the promise has the responsibility of keeping the promise,
   and He is equal to the occasion. God, who promises this marvellous
   change, will assuredly carry it out in all who receive Jesus, for to
   all such He gives power to become the Sons of God. Oh that you would
   believe it! Oh that you would do the gracious Lord the justice to
   believe that He can and will do this for you, great miracle though it
   will be! Oh that you would believe that God cannot lie! Oh that you
   would trust Him for a new heart, and a right spirit, for He can give
   them to you! May the Lord give you faith in His promise, faith in His
   Son, faith in the Holy Spirit, and faith in Him, and to Him shall be
   praise and honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

BY GRACE THROUGH FAITH

   "By grace are ye saved, through faith" (Ephesians 2:8 ).

   I THINK IT WELL to turn a little to one side that I may ask my reader
   to observe adoringly the fountain-head of our salvation, which is the
   grace of God. "By grace are ye saved." Because God is gracious,
   therefore sinful men are forgiven, converted, purified, and saved. It
   is not because of anything in them, or that ever can be in them, that
   they are saved; but because of the boundless love, goodness, pity,
   compassion, mercy, and grace of God. Tarry a moment, then, at the
   well-head. Behold the pure river of water of life, as it proceeds out
   of the throne of God and of the Lamb!

   What an abyss is the grace of God! Who can measure its breadth? Who can
   fathom its depth? Like all the rest of the divine attributes, it is
   infinite. God is full of love, for "God is love." God is full of
   goodness; the very name "God" is short for "good." Unbounded goodness
   and love enter into the very essence of the Godhead. It is because "his
   mercy endureth for ever" that men are not destroyed; because "his
   compassions fail not" that sinners are brought to Him and forgiven.

   Remember this; or you may fall into error by fixing your minds so much
   upon the faith which is the channel of salvation as to forget the grace
   which is the fountain and source even of faith itself. Faith is the
   work of God's grace in us. No man can say that Jesus is the Christ but
   by the Holy Ghost. "No man cometh unto me," saith Jesus, "except the
   Father which hath sent me draw him." So that faith, which is coming to
   Christ, is the result of divine drawing. Grace is the first and last
   moving cause of salvation; and faith, essential as it is, is only an
   important part of the machinery which grace employs. We are saved
   "through faith," but salvation is "by grace." Sound forth those words
   as with the archangel's trumpet: "By grace are ye saved." What glad
   tidings for the undeserving!

   Faith occupies the position of a channel or conduit pipe. Grace is the
   fountain and the stream; faith is the aqueduct along which the flood of
   mercy flows down to refresh the thirsty sons of men. It is a great pity
   when the aqueduct is broken. It is a sad sight to see around Rome the
   many noble aqueducts which no longer convey water into the city,
   because the arches are broken and the marvelous structures are in
   ruins. The aqueduct must be kept entire to convey the current; and,
   even so, faith must be true and sound, leading right up to God and
   coming right down to ourselves, that it may become a serviceable
   channel of mercy to our souls.

   Still, I again remind you that faith is only the channel or aqueduct,
   and not the fountainhead, and we must not look so much to it as to
   exalt it above the divine source of all blessing which lies in the
   grace of God. Never make a Christ out of your faith, nor think of as if
   it were the independent source of your salvation. Our life is found in
   "looking unto Jesus," not in looking to our own faith. By faith all
   things become possible to us; yet the power is not in the faith, but in
   the God upon whom faith relies. Grace is the powerful engine, and faith
   is the chain by which the carriage of the soul is attached to the great
   motive power. The righteousness of faith is not the moral excellence of
   faith, but the righteousness of Jesus Christ which faith grasps and
   appropriates. The peace within the soul is not derived from the
   contemplation of our own faith; but it comes to us from Him who is our
   peace, the hem of whose garment faith touches, and virtue comes out of
   Him into the soul.

   See then, dear friend, that the weakness of your faith will not destroy
   you. A trembling hand may receive a golden gift. The Lord's salvation
   can come to us though we have only faith as a grain of mustard seed.
   The power lies in the grace of God, and not in our faith. Great
   messages can be sent along slender wires, and the peace-giving witness
   of the Holy Spirit can reach the heart by means of a thread-like faith
   which seems almost unable to sustain its own weight. Think more of Him
   to whom you look than of the look itself. You must look away even from
   your own looking, and see nothing but Jesus, and the grace of God
   revealed in Him.

FAITH, WHAT IS IT?

   WHAT IS THIS FAITH concerning which it is said, "By grace are ye saved,
   through faith?" There are many descriptions of faith; but almost all
   the definitions I have met with have made me understand it less than I
   did before I saw them. The Negro said, when he read the chapter, that
   he would confound it; and it is very likely that he did so, though he
   meant to expound it. We may explain faith till nobody understands it. I
   hope I shall not be guilty of that fault. Faith is the simplest of all
   things, and perhaps because of its simplicity it is the more difficult
   to explain.

   What is faith? It is made up of three things--knowledge, belief, and
   trust. Knowledge comes first. "How shall they believe in him of whom
   they have not heard?" I want to be informed of a fact before I can
   possibly believe it. "Faith cometh by hearing"; we must first hear, in
   order that we may know what is to be believed. "They that know thy name
   shall put their trust in thee." A measure of knowledge is essential to
   faith; hence the importance of getting knowledge. "Incline your ear,
   and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live." Such was the word of
   the ancient prophet, and it is the word of the gospel still. Search the
   Scriptures and learn what the Holy Spirit teacheth concerning Christ
   and His salvation. Seek to know God: "For he that cometh to God must
   believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek him." May the Holy Spirit give you the spirit of knowledge, and of
   the fear of the Lord! Know the gospel: know what the good news is, how
   it talks of free forgiveness, and of change of heart, of adoption into
   the family of God, and of countless other blessings. Know especially
   Christ Jesus the Son of God, the Saviour of men, united to us by His
   human nature, and yet one with God; and thus able to act as Mediator
   between God and man, able to lay His hand upon both, and to be the
   connecting link between the sinner and the Judge of all the earth.
   Endeavour to know more and more of Christ Jesus. Endeavour especially
   to know the doctrine of the sacrifice of Christ; for the point upon
   which saving faith mainly fixes itself is this--"God was in Christ,
   reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
   them." Know that Jesus was "made a curse for us, as it is written,
   Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree." Drink deep of the doctrine
   of the substitutionary work of Christ; for therein lies the sweetest
   possible comfort to the guilty sons of men, since the Lord "made him to
   be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
   Faith begins with knowledge.

   The mind goes on to believe that these things are true. The soul
   believes that God is, and that He hears the cries of sincere hearts;
   that the gospel is from God; that justification by faith is the grand
   truth which God hath revealed in these last days by His Spirit more
   clearly than before. Then the heart believes that Jesus is verily and
   in truth our God and Saviour, the Redeemer of men, the Prophet, Priest,
   and King of His people. All this is accepted as sure truth, not to be
   called in question. I pray that you may at once come to this. Get
   firmly to believe that "the blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son,
   cleanseth us from all sin"; that His sacrifice is complete and fully
   accepted of God on man's behalf, so that he that believeth on Jesus is
   not condemned. Believe these truths as you believe any other
   statements; for the difference between common faith and saving faith
   lies mainly in the subjects upon which it is exercised. Believe the
   witness of God just as you believe the testimony of your own father or
   friend. "If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is
   greater."

   So far you have made an advance toward faith; only one more ingredient
   is needed to complete it, which is trust. Commit yourself to the
   merciful God; rest your hope on the gracious gospel; trust your soul on
   the dying and living Saviour; wash away your sins in the atoning blood;
   accept His perfect righteousness, and all is well. Trust is the
   lifeblood of faith; there is no saving faith without it. The Puritans
   were accustomed to explain faith by the word "recumbency." It meant
   leaning upon a thing. Lean with all your weight upon Christ. It would
   be a better illustration still if I said, fall at full length, and lie
   on the Rock of Ages. Cast yourself upon Jesus; rest in Him; commit
   yourself to Him. That done, you have exercised saving faith. Faith is
   not a blind thing; for faith begins with knowledge. It is not a
   speculative thing; for faith believes facts of which it is sure. It is
   not an unpractical, dreamy thing; for faith trusts, and stakes its
   destiny upon the truth of revelation. That is one way of describing
   what faith is.

   Let me try again. Faith is believing that Christ is what He is said to
   be, and that He will do what He has promised to do, and then to expect
   this of Him. The Scriptures speak of Jesus Christ as being God, God is
   human flesh; as being perfect in His character; as being made of a
   sin-offering on our behalf; as bearing our sins in His own body on the
   tree. The Scripture speaks of Him as having finished transgression,
   made an end of sin, and brought in everlasting righteousness. The
   sacred records further tell us that He "rose again from the dead," that
   He "ever liveth to make intercession for us," that He has gone up into
   the glory, and has taken possession of Heaven on the behalf of His
   people, and that He will shortly come again "to judge the world in
   righteousness, and his people with equity." We are most firmly to
   believe that it is even so; for this is the testimony of God the Father
   when He said, "This is my beloved Son; hear ye him." This also is
   testified by God the Holy Spirit; for the Spirit has borne witness to
   Christ, both in the inspired Word and by divers miracles, and by His
   working in the hearts of men. We are to believe this testimony to be
   true.

   Faith also believes that Christ will do what He has promised; that
   since He has promised to cast out none that come to Him, it is certain
   that He will not cast us out if we come to Him. Faith believes that
   since Jesus said, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a
   well of water springing up into everasting life, it must be true; and
   if we get this living Water from Christ it will abide in us, and will
   well up within us in streams of holy life. Whatever Christ has promised
   to do He will do, and we must believe this, so as to look for pardon,
   justification, preservation, and eternal glory from His hands,
   according as He has promised them to believers in Him.

   Then comes the next necessary step. Jesus is what He is said to be,
   Jesus will do what He says He will do; therefore we must each one trust
   Him, saying, "He will be to me what He says He is, and He will do to me
   what He has promised to do; I leave myself in the hands of Him who is
   appointed to save, that He may save me. I rest upon His promise that He
   will do even as He has said." This is a saving faith, and he that hath
   it hath everlasting life. Whatever his dangers and difficulties,
   whatever his darkness and depression, whatever his infirmities and
   sins, he that believeth thus on Christ Jesus is not condemned, and
   shall never come into condemnation.

   May that explanation be of some service! I trust it may be used by the
   Spirit of God to direct my reader into immediate peace. "Be not afraid;
   only believe." Trust, and be at rest.

   My fear is lest the reader should rest content with understanding what
   is to be done, and yet never do it. Better the poorest real faith
   actually at work, than the best ideal of it left in the region of
   speculation. The great matter is to believe on the Lord Jesus at once.
   Never mind distinctions and definitions. A hungry man eats though he
   does not understand the composition of his food, the anatomy of his
   mouth, or the process of digestion: he lives because he eats. Another
   far more clever person understands thoroughly the science of nutrition;
   but if he does not eat he will die, with all his knowledge. There are,
   no doubt, many at this hour in Hell who understood the doctrine of
   faith, but did not believe. On the other hand, not one who has trusted
   in the Lord Jesus has ever been cast out, though he may never have been
   able intelligently to define his faith. Oh dear reader, receive the
   Lord Jesus into your soul, and you shall live forever! "He that
   believeth in Him hath everlasting life."
     __________________________________________________________________

HOW MAY FAITH BE ILLUSTRATED?

   TO MAKE THE MATTER Of faith clearer still, I will give you a few
   illustrations. Though the Holy Spirit alone can make my reader see, it
   is my duty and my joy to furnish all the light I can, and to pray the
   divine Lord to open blind eyes. Oh that my reader would pray the same
   prayer for himself!

     The faith which saves has its analogies in the human frame.
     It is the eye which looks. By the eye we bring into the mind that
     which is far away; we can bring the sun and the far-off stars into
     the mind by a glance of the eye. So by trust we bring the Lord Jesus
     near to us; and though He be far away in Heaven, He enters into our
     heart. Only look to Jesus; for the hymn is strictly true--
     There is life in a look at the Crucified One,
     There is life at this moment for thee.

   Faith is the hand which grasps. When our hand takes hold of anything
   for itself, it does precisely what faith does when it appropriates
   Christ and the blessings of His redemption. Faith says, "Jesus is
   mine." Faith hears of the pardoning blood, and cries, "I accept it to
   pardon me." Faith calls the legacies of the dying Jesus her own; and
   they are her own, for faith is Christ's heir; He has given Himself and
   all that He has to faith. Take, O friend, that which grace has provided
   for thee. You will not be a thief, for you have a divine permit:
   "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." He who may
   have a treasure simply by his grasping it will be foolish indeed if he
   remains poor.

   Faith is the mouth which feeds upon Christ. Before food can nourish us,
   it must be received into us. This is a simple matter- -this eating and
   drinking. We willingly receive into the mouth that which is our food,
   and then we consent that it should pass down into our inward parts,
   wherein it is taken up and absorbed into our bodily frame. Paul says,
   in his Epistle to the Romans, in the tenth chapter, "The word is nigh
   thee, even in thy mouth." Now then, all that is to be done is to
   swallow it, to suffer it to go down into the soul. Oh that men had an
   appetite! For he who is hungry and sees meat before him does not need
   to be taught how to eat. "Give me," said one, "a knife and a fork and a
   chance." He was fully prepared to do the rest. Truly, a heart which
   hungers and thirsts after Christ has but to know that He is freely
   given, and at once it will receive Him. If my reader is in such a case,
   let him not hesitate to receive Jesus; for he may be sure that he will
   never be blamed for doing so: for unto "as many as received him, to
   them gave he power to become the sons of God." He never repulses one,
   but He authorizes all who come to remain sons for ever.

   The pursuits of life illustrate faith in many ways. The farmer buries
   good seed in the earth, and expects it not only to live but to be
   multiplied. He has faith in the covenant arrangement, that "seed-time
   and harvest shall not cease," and he is rewarded for his faith.

   The merchant places his money in the care of a banker, and trusts
   altogether to the honesty and soundness of the bank. He entrusts his
   capital to another's hands, and feels far more at ease than if he had
   the solid gold locked up in an iron safe.

   The sailor trusts himself to the sea. When he swims he takes his foot
   from the bottom and rests upon the buoyant ocean. He could not swim if
   he did not wholly cast himself upon the water.

   The goldsmith puts precious metal into the fire which seems eager to
   consume it, but he receives it back again from the furnace purified by
   the heat.

   You cannot turn anywhere in life without seeing faith in operation
   between man and man, or between man and natural law. Now, just as we
   trust in daily life, even so are we to trust in God as He is revealed
   in Christ Jesus.

   Faith exists in different persons in various degrees, according to the
   amount of their knowledge or growth in grace. Sometimes faith is little
   more than a simple clinging to Christ; a sense of dependence and a
   willingness so to depend. When you are down at the seaside you will see
   limpets sticking to the rock. You walk with a soft tread up to the
   rock; you strike the mollusk a rapid blow with your walking-stick and
   off he comes. Try the next limpet in that way. You have given him
   warning; he heard the blow with which you struck his neighbor, and he
   clings with all his might. You will never get him off; not you! Strike,
   and strike again, but you may as soon break the rock. Our little
   friend, the limpet, does not know much, but he clings. He is not
   acquainted with the geological formation of the rock, but he clings. He
   can cling, and he has found something to cling to: this is all his
   stock of knowledge, and he uses it for his security and salvation. It
   is the limpet's life to cling to the rock, and it is the sinner's life
   to cling to Jesus. Thousands of God's people have no more faith than
   this; they know enough to cling to Jesus with all their heart and soul,
   and this suffices for present peace and eternal safety. Jesus Christ is
   to them a Saviour strong and mighty, a Rock immovable and immutable;
   they cling to him for dear life, and this clinging saves them. Reader,
   cannot you cling? Do so at once.

   Faith is seen when one man relies upon another from a knowledge of the
   superiority of the other. This is a higher faith; the faith which knows
   the reason for its dependence, and acts upon it. I do not think the
   limpet knows much about the rock: but as faith grows it becomes more
   and more intelligent. A blind man trusts himself with his guide because
   he knows that his friend can see, and, trusting, he walks where his
   guide conducts him. If the poor man is born blind he does not know what
   sight is; but he knows that there is such a thing as sight, and that it
   is possessed by his friend and therefore he freely puts his hand into
   the hand of the seeing one, and follows his leadership. "We walk by
   faith, not by sight." "Blessed are they which have not seen, and yet
   have believed." This is as good an image of faith as well can be; we
   know that Jesus has about Him merit, and power, and blessing, which we
   do not possess, and therefore we gladly trust ourselves to Him to be to
   us what we cannot be to ourselves. We trust Him as the blind man trusts
   his guide. He never betrays our confidence; but He "is made of God unto
   us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption."

   Every boy that goes to school has to exert faith while learning. His
   schoolmaster teaches him geography, and instructs him as to the form of
   the earth, and the existence of certain great cities and empires. The
   boy does not himself know that these things are true, except that he
   believes his teacher, and the books put into his hands. That is what
   you will have to do with Christ, if you are to be saved; you must
   simply know because He tells you, believe because He assures you it is
   even so, and trust yourself with Him because He promises you that
   salvation will be the result. Almost all that you and I know has come
   to us by faith. A scientific discovery has been made, and we are sure
   of it. On what grounds do we believe it? On the authority of certain
   well-known men of learning, whose reputations are established. We have
   never made or seen their experiments, but we believe their witness. You
   must do the like with regard to Jesus: because He teaches you certain
   truths you are to be His disciple, and believe His words; because He
   has performed certain acts you are to be His client, and trust yourself
   with Him. He is infinitely superior to you, and presents himself to
   your confidence as your Master and Lord. If you will receive Him and
   His words you shall be saved.

   Another and a higher form of faith is that faith which grows out of
   love. Why does a boy trust his father? The reason why the child trusts
   his father is because he loves him. Blessed and happy are they who have
   a sweet faith in Jesus, intertwined with deep affection for Him, for
   this is a restful confidence. These lovers of Jesus are charmed with
   His character, and delighted with His mission, they are carried away by
   the lovingkindness that He has manifested, and therefore they cannot
   help trusting Him, because they so much admire, revere, and love Him.

   The way of loving trust in the Saviour may thus be illustrated. A lady
   is the wife of the most eminent physician of the day. She is seized
   with a dangerous illness, and is smitten down by its power; yet she is
   wonderfully calm and quiet, for her husband has made this disease his
   special study, and has healed thousands who were similarly afflicted.
   She is not in the least troubled, for she feels perfectly safe in the
   hands of one so dear to her, and in whom skill and love are blended in
   their highest forms. Her faith is reasonable and natural; her husband,
   from every point of view, deserves it of her. This is the kind of faith
   which the happiest of believers exercise toward Christ. There is no
   physician like Him, none can save as He can; we love Him, and He loves
   us, and therefore we put ourselves into His hands, accept whatever He
   prescribes, and do whatever He bids. We feel that nothing can be
   wrongly ordered while He is the director of our affairs; for He loves
   us too well to let us perish, or suffer a single needless pang.

   Faith is the root of obedience, and this may be clearly seen in the
   affairs of life. When a captain trusts a pilot to steer his vessel into
   port he manages the vessel according to his direction. When a traveler
   trusts a guide to conduct him over a difficult pass, he follows the
   track which his guide points out. When a patient believes in a
   physician, he carefully follows his prescriptions and directions. Faith
   which refuses to obey the commands of the Saviour is a mere pretence,
   and will never save the soul. We trust Jesus to save us; He gives us
   directions as to the way of salvation; we follow those directions and
   are saved. Let not my reader forget this. Trust Jesus, and prove your
   trust by doing whatever He bids you.

   A notable form of faith arises out of assured knowledge; this comes of
   growth in grace, and is the faith which believes Christ because it
   knows Him, and trusts Him because it has proved Him to be infallibly
   faithful. An old Christian was in the habit of writing T and P in the
   margin of her Bible whenever she had tried and proved a promise. How
   easy it is to trust a tried and proved Saviour! You cannot do this as
   yet, but you will do so. Everything must have a beginning. You will
   rise to strong faith in due time. This matured faith asks not for signs
   and tokens, but bravely believes. Look at the faith of the master
   mariner--I have often wondered at it. He looses his cable, he steams
   away from the land. For days, weeks, or even months, he never sees sail
   or shore; yet on he goes day and night without fear, till one morning
   he finds himself exactly opposite to the desired haven toward which he
   has been steering. How has he found his way over the trackless deep? He
   has trusted in his compass, his nautical almanac, his glass, and the
   heavenly bodies; and obeying their guidance, without sighting land, he
   has steered so accurately that he has not to change a point to enter
   into port. It is a wonderful thing--that sailing or steaming without
   sight. Spiritually it is a blessed thing to leave altogether the shores
   of sight and feeling, and to say, "Good-by" to inward feelings,
   cheering providences, signs, tokens, and so forth. It is glorious to be
   far out on the ocean of divine love, believing in God, and steering for
   Heaven straight away by the direction of the Word of God. "Blessed are
   they that have not seen, and yet have believed"; to them shall be
   administered an abundant entrance at the last, and a safe voyage on the
   way. Will not my reader put his trust in God in Christ Jesus. There I
   rest with joyous confidence. Brother, come with me, and believe our
   Father and our Saviour. Come at once.
     __________________________________________________________________

WHY ARE WE SAVED BY FAITH?

   WHY IS FAITH SELECTED as the channel of salvation? No doubt this
   inquiry is often made. "By grace are ye saved through faith," is
   assuredly the doctrine of Holy Scripture, and the ordinance of God; but
   why is it so? Why is faith selected rather than hope, or love, or
   patience?

   It becomes us to be modest in answering such a question, for God's ways
   are not always to be understood; nor are we allowed presumptuously to
   question them. Humbly we would reply that, as far as we can tell, faith
   has been selected as the channel of grace, because there is a natural
   adaptation in faith to be used as the receiver. Suppose that I am about
   to give a poor man an alms: I put it into his hand--why? Well, it would
   hardly be fitting to put it into his ear, or to lay it upon his foot;
   the hand seems made on purpose to receive. So, in our mental frame,
   faith is created on purpose to be a receiver: it is the hand of the
   man, and there is a fitness in receiving grace by its means.

   Do let me put this very plainly. Faith which receives Christ is as
   simple an act as when your child receives an apple from you, because
   you hold it out and promise to give him the apple if he comes for it.
   The belief and the receiving relate only to an apple; but they make up
   precisely the same act as the faith which deals with eternal salvation.
   What the child's hand is to the apple, that your faith is to the
   perfect salvation of Christ. The child's hand does not make the apple,
   nor improve the apple, nor deserve the apple; it only takes it; and
   faith is chosen by God to be the receiver of salvation, because it does
   not pretend to create salvation, nor to help in it, but it is content
   humbly to receive it. "Faith is the tongue that begs pardon, the hand
   which receives it, and the eye which sees it; but it is not the price
   which buys it." Faith never makes herself her own plea, she rests all
   her argument upon the blood of Christ. She becomes a good servant to
   bring the riches of the Lord Jesus to the soul, because she
   acknowledges whence she drew them, and owns that grace alone entrusted
   her with them.

   Faith, again, is doubtless selected because it gives all the glory to
   God. It is of faith that it might be by grace, and it is of grace that
   there might be no boasting; for God cannot endure pride. "The proud he
   knoweth afar off," and He has no wish to come nearer to them. He will
   not give salvation in a way which will suggest or foster pride. Paul
   saith, "Not of works, lest any man should boast." Now, faith excludes
   all boasting. The hand which receives charity does not say, "I am to be
   thanked for accepting the gift"; that would be absurd. When the hand
   conveys bread to the mouth it does not say to the body, "Thank me; for
   I feed you." It is a very simple thing that the hand does though a very
   necessary thing; and it never arrogates glory to itself for what it
   does. So God has selected faith to receive the unspeakable gift of His
   grace, because it cannot take to itself any credit, but must adore the
   gracious God who is the giver of all good. Faith sets the crown upon
   the right head, and therefore the Lord Jesus was wont to put the crown
   upon the head of faith, saying, "Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
   peace."

   Next, God selects faith as the channel of salvation because it is a
   sure method, linking man with God. When man confides in God, there is a
   point of union between them, and that union guarantees blessing. Faith
   saves us because it makes us cling to God, and so brings us into
   connection with Him. I have often used the following illustration, but
   I must repeat it, because I cannot think of a better. I am told that
   years ago a boat was upset above the falls of Niagara, and two men were
   being carried down the current, when persons on the shore managed to
   float a rope out to them, which rope was seized by them both. One of
   them held fast to it and was safely drawn to the bank; but the other,
   seeing a great log come floating by, unwisely let go the rope and clung
   to the log, for it was the bigger thing of the two, and apparently
   better to cling to. Alas! the log with the man on it went right over
   the vast abyss, because there was no union between the log and the
   shore. The size of the log was no benefit to him who grasped it; it
   needed a connection with the shore to produce safety. So when a man
   trusts to his works, or to sacraments, or to anything of that sort, he
   will not be saved, because there is no junction between him and Christ;
   but faith, though it may seem to be like a slender cord, is in the
   hands of the great God on the shore side; infinite power pulls in the
   connecting line, and thus draws the man from destruction. Oh the
   blessedness of faith, because it unites us to God!

   Faith is chosen again, because it touches the springs of action. Even
   in common things faith of a certain sort lies at the root of all. I
   wonder whether I shall be wrong if I say that we never do anything
   except through faith of some sort. If I walk across my study it is
   because I believe my legs will carry me. A man eats because he believes
   in the necessity of food; he goes to business because he believes in
   the value of money; he accepts a check because he believes that the
   bank will honor it. Columbus discovered America because he believed
   that there was another continent beyond the ocean; and the Pilgrim
   Fathers colonized it because they believed that God would be with them
   on those rocky shores. Most grand deeds have been born of faith; for
   good or for evil, faith works wonders by the man in whom it dwells.
   Faith in its natural form is an all-prevailing force, which enters into
   all manner of human actions. Possibly he who derides faith in God is
   the man who in an evil form has the most of faith; indeed, he usually
   falls into a credulity which would be ridiculous, if it were not
   disgraceful. God gives salvation to faith, because by creating faith in
   us He thus touches the real mainspring of our emotions and actions. He
   has, so to speak, taken possession of the battery and now He can send
   the sacred current to every part of our nature. When we believe in
   Christ, and the heart has come into the possession of God, then we are
   saved from sin, and are moved toward repentance, holiness, zeal,
   prayer, consecration, and every other gracious thing. "What oil is to
   the wheels, what weights are to a clock, what wings are to a bird, what
   sails are to a ship, that faith is to all holy duties and services."
   Have faith, and all other graces will follow and continue to hold their
   course.

   Faith, again, has the power of working by love; it influences the
   affections toward God, and draws the heart after the best things. He
   that believes in God will beyond all question love God. Faith is an act
   of the understanding; but it also proceeds from the heart. "With the
   heart man believeth unto righteousness"; and hence God gives salvation
   to faith because it resides next door to the affections, and is near
   akin to love; and love is the parent and the nurse of every holy
   feeling and act. Love to God is obedience, love to God is holiness. To
   love God and to love man is to be conformed to the image of Christ; and
   this is salvation.

   Moreover, faith creates peace and joy; he that hath it rests, and is
   tranquil, is glad and joyous, and this is a preparation for heaven. God
   gives all heavenly gifts to faith, for this reason among others, that
   faith worketh in us the life and spirit which are to be eternally
   manifested in the upper and better world. Faith furnishes us with armor
   for this life, and education for the life to come. It enables a man
   both to live and to die without fear; it prepares both for action and
   for suffering; and hence the Lord selects it as a most convenient
   medium for conveying grace to us, and thereby securing us for glory.

   Certainly faith does for us what nothing else can do; it gives us joy
   and peace, and causes us to enter into rest. Why do men attempt to gain
   salvation by other means? An old preacher says, "A silly servant who is
   bidden to open a door, sets his shoulder to it and pushes with all his
   might; but the door stirs not, and he cannot enter, use what strength
   he may. Another comes with a key, and easily unlocks the door, and
   enters right readily. Those who would be saved by works are pushing at
   heaven's gate without result; but faith is the key which opens the gate
   at once." Reader, will you not use that key? The Lord commands you to
   believe in His dear Son, therefore you may do so; and doing so you
   shall live. Is not this the promise of the gospel, "He that believeth
   and is baptized shall be saved"? (Mark 16:16). What can be your
   objection to a way of salvation which commends itself to the mercy and
   the wisdom of our gracious God?
     __________________________________________________________________

ALAS! I CAN DO NOTHING!

   AFTER THE ANXIOUS HEART has accepted the doctrine of atonement, and
   learned the great truth that salvation is by faith in the Lord Jesus,
   it is often sore troubled with a sense of inability toward that which
   is good. Many are groaning, "I can do nothing." They are not making
   this into an excuse, but they feel it as a daily burden. They would if
   they could. They can each one honestly say, "To will is present with
   me, but how to perform that which I would I find not."

   This feeling seems to make all the gospel null and void; for what is
   the use of food to a hungry man if he cannot get at it? Of what avail
   is the river of the water of life if one cannot drink? We recall the
   story of the doctor and the poor woman's child. The sage practitioner
   told the mother that her little one would soon be better under proper
   treatment, but it was absolutely needful that her boy should regularly
   drink the best wine, and that he should spend a season at one of the
   German spas. This, to a widow who could hardly get bread to eat! Now,
   it sometimes seems to the troubled heart that the simple gospel of
   "Believe and live," is not, after all, so very simple; for it asks the
   poor sinner to do what he cannot do. To the really awakened, but half
   instructed, there appears to be a missing link; yonder is the salvation
   of Jesus, but how is it to be reached? The soul is without strength,
   and knows not what to do. It lies within sight of the city of refuge,
   and cannot enter its gate.

   Is this want of strength provided for in the plan of salvation? It is.
   The work of the Lord is perfect. It begins where we are, and asks
   nothing of us in order to its completion. When the good Samaritan saw
   the traveler lying wounded and half dead, he did not bid him rise and
   come to him, and mount the ass and ride off to the inn. No, "he came
   where he was," and ministered to him, and lifted him upon the beast and
   bore him to the inn. Thus doth the Lord Jesus deal with us in our low
   and wretched estate.

   We have seen that God justifieth, that He justifieth the ungodly and
   that He justifies them through faith in the precious blood of Jesus; we
   have now to see the condition these ungodly ones are in when Jesus
   works out their salvation. Many awakened persons are not only troubled
   about their sin, but about their moral weakness. They have no strength
   with which to escape from the mire into which they have fallen, nor to
   keep out of it in after days. They not only lament over what they have
   done, but over what they cannot do. They feel themselves to be
   powerless, helpless, and spiritually lifeless. It may sound odd to say
   that they feel dead, and yet it is even so. They are, in their own
   esteem, to all good incapable. They cannot travel the road to Heaven,
   for their bones are broken. "None of the men of strength have found
   their hands;" in fact, they are "without strength." Happily, it is
   written, as the commendation of God's love to us:

   When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly (Romans 5:6).

   Here we see conscious helplessness succored--succored by the
   interposition of the Lord Jesus. Our helplessness is extreme. It is not
   written, "When we were comparatively weak Christ died for us"; or,
   "When we had only a little strength"; but the description is absolute
   and unrestricted; "When we were yet without strength." We had no
   strength whatever which could aid in our salvation; our Lord's words
   were emphatically true, "Without me ye can do nothing." I may go
   further than the text, and remind you of the great love wherewith the
   Lord loved us, "even when we were dead in trespasses and sins." To be
   dead is even more than to be without strength.

   The one thing that the poor strengthless sinner has to fix his mind
   upon, and firmly retain, as his one ground of hope, is the divine
   assurance that "in due time Christ died for the ungodly." Believe this,
   and all inability will disappear. As it is fabled of Midas that he
   turned everything into gold by his touch, so it is true of faith that
   it turns everything it touches into good. Our very needs and weaknesses
   become blessings when faith deals with them.

   Let us dwell upon certain forms of this want of strength. To begin
   with, one man will say, "Sir, I do not seem to have strength to collect
   my thoughts, and keep them fixed upon those solemn topics which concern
   my salvation; a short prayer is almost too much for me. It is so
   partly, perhaps, through natural weakness, partly because I have
   injured myself through dissipation, and partly also because I worry
   myself with wordly cares, so that I am not capable of those high
   thoughts which are necessary ere a soul can be saved." This is a very
   common form of sinful weakness. Note this! You are without strength on
   this point; and there are many like you. They could not carry out a
   train of consecutive thought to save their lives. Many poor men and
   women are illiterate and untrained, and these would find deep thought
   to be very heavy work. Others are so light and trifling by nature, that
   they could no more follow out a long process of argument and reasoning,
   than they could fly. They could never attain to the knowledge of any
   profound mystery if they expended their whole life in the effort. You
   need not, therefore, despair: that which is necessary to salvation is
   not continuous thought, but a simple reliance upon Jesus. Hold you on
   to this one fact-- "In due time Christ died for the ungodly." This
   truth will not require from you any deep research or profound
   reasoning, or convincing argument. There it stands: "In due time Christ
   died for the ungodly." Fix your mind on that, and rest there.

   Let this one great, gracious, glorious fact lie in your spirit till it
   perfumes all your thoughts, and makes you rejoice even though you are
   without strength, seeing the Lord Jesus has become your strength and
   your song, yea, He has become your salvation. According to the
   Scriptures it is a revealed fact, that in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly when they were yet without strength. You have heard these words
   hundreds of times, maybe, and yet you have never before perceived their
   meaning. There is a cheering savor about them, is there not? Jesus did
   not die for our righteousness, but He died for our sins. He did not
   come to save us because we were worth the saving, but because we were
   utterly worthless, ruined, and undone. He came not to earth out of any
   reason that was in us, but solely and only out of reasons which He
   fetched from the depths of His own divine love. In due time He died for
   those whom He describes, not as godly, but as ungodly, applying to them
   as hopeless an adjective as He could well have selected. If you have
   but little mind, yet fasten it to this truth, which is fitted to the
   smallest capacity, and is able to cheer the heaviest heart. Let this
   text lie under your tongue like a sweet morsel, till it dissolves into
   your heart and flavors all your thoughts; and then it will little
   matter though those thoughts should be as scattered as autumn leaves.
   Persons who have never shone in science, nor displayed the least
   originality of mind, have nevertheless been fully able to accept the
   doctrine of the cross, and have been saved thereby. Why should not you?

   I hear another man cry, "Oh, sir my want of strength lies mainly in
   this, that I cannot repent sufficiently!" A curious idea men have of
   what repentance is! Many fancy that so many tears are to be shed, and
   so many groans are to be heaved, and so much despair is to be endured.
   Whence comes this unreasonable notion? Unbelief and despair are sins,
   and therefore I do not see how they can be constituent elements of
   acceptable repentance; yet there are many who regard them as necessary
   parts of true Christian experience. They are in great error. Still, I
   know what they mean, for in the days of my darkness I used to feel in
   the same way. I desired to repent, but I thought that I could not do
   it, and yet all the while I was repenting. Odd as it may sound, I felt
   that I could not feel. I used to get into a corner and weep, because I
   could not weep; and I fell into bitter sorrow because I could not
   sorrow for sin. What a jumble it all is when in our unbelieving state
   we begin to judge our own condition! It is like a blind man looking at
   his own eyes. My heart was melted within me for fear, because I thought
   that my heart was as hard as an adamant stone. My heart was broken to
   think that it would not break. Now I can see that I was exhibiting the
   very thing which I thought I did not possess; but then I knew not where
   I was.

   Oh that I could help others into the light which I now enjoy! Fain
   would I say a word which might shorten the time of their bewilderment.
   I would say a few plain words, and pray "the Comforter" to apply them
   to the heart.

   Remember that the man who truly repents is never satisfied with his own
   repentance. We can no more repent perfectly than we can live perfectly.
   However pure our tears, there will always be some dirt in them: there
   will be something to be repented of even in our best repentance. But
   listen! To repent is to change your mind about sin, and Christ, and all
   the great things of God. There is sorrow implied in this; but the main
   point is the turning of the heart from sin to Christ. If there be this
   turning, you have the essence of true repentance, even though no alarm
   and no despair should ever have cast their shadow upon your mind.

   If you cannot repent as you would, it will greatly aid you to do so if
   you will firmly believe that "in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
   Think of this again and again. How can you continue to be hard-hearted
   when you know that out of supreme love "Christ died for the ungodly"?
   Let me persuade you to reason with yourself thus: Ungodly as I am,
   though this heart of steel will not relent, though I smite in vain upon
   my breast, yet He died for such as I am, since He died for the ungodly.
   Oh that I may believe this and feel the power of it upon my flinty
   heart!

   Blot out every other reflection from your soul, and sit down by the
   hour together, and meditate deeply on this one resplendent display of
   unmerited, unexpected, unexampled love, "Christ died for the ungodly."
   Read over carefully the narrative of the Lord's death, as you find it
   in the four evangelists. If anything can melt your stubborn heart, it
   will be a sight of the sufferings of Jesus, and the consideration that
   he suffered all this for His enemies.

   O Jesus! sweet the tears I shed, While at Thy feet I kneel,

   Gaze on Thy wounded, fainting head, And all Thy sorrows feel.

   My heart dissolves to see Thee bleed, This heart so hard before;

   I hear Thee for the guilty plead, And grief o'erflows the more.

   'Twas for the sinful Thou didst die, And I a sinner stand:

   Convinc'd by Thine expiring eye, Slain by Thy pierced hand.

   Surely the cross is that wonder-working rod which can bring water out
   of a rock. If you understand the full meaning of the divine sacrifice
   of Jesus, you must repent of ever having been opposed to One who is so
   full of love. It is written, "They shall look upon him whom they have
   pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only
   son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness
   for his firstborn." Repentance will not make you see Christ; but to see
   Christ will give you repentance. You may not make a Christ out of your
   repentance, but you must look for repentance to Christ. The Holy Ghost,
   by turning us to Christ, turns us from sin. Look away, then, from the
   effect to the cause, from your own repenting to the Lord Jesus, who is
   exalted on high to give repentance.

   I have heard another say, "I am tormented with horrible thoughts.
   Wherever I go, blasphemies steal in upon me. Frequently at my work a
   dreadful suggestion forces itself upon me, and even on my bed I am
   startled from my sleep by whispers of the evil one. I cannot get away
   from this horrible temptation." Friend, I know what you mean, for I
   have myself been hunted by this wolf. A man might as well hope to fight
   a swarm of flies with a sword as to master his own thoughts when they
   are set on by the devil. A poor tempted soul, assailed by satanic
   suggestions, is like a traveler I have read of, about whose head and
   ears and whole body there came a swarm of angry bees. He could not keep
   them off nor escape from them. They stung him everywhere and threatened
   to be the death of him. I do not wonder you feel that you are without
   strength to stop these hideous and abominable thoughts which Satan
   pours into your soul; but yet I would remind you of the Scripture
   before us--"When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
   for the ungodly." Jesus knew where we were and where we should be; He
   saw that we could not overcome the prince of the power of the air; He
   knew that we should be greatly worried by him; but even then, when He
   saw us in that condition, Christ died for the ungodly. Cast the anchor
   of your faith upon this. The devil himself cannot tell you that you are
   not ungodly; believe, then, that Jesus died even for such as you are.
   Remember Martin Luther's way of cutting the devil's head off with his
   own sword. "Oh," said the devil to Martin Luther, "you are a sinner."
   "Yes," said he, "Christ died to save sinners." Thus he smote him with
   his own sword. Hide you in this refuge, and keep there: "In due time
   Christ died for the ungodly." If you stand to that truth, your
   blasphemous thoughts which you have not the strength to drive away will
   go away of themselves; for Satan will see that he is answering no
   purpose by plaguing you with them.

   These thoughts, if you hate them, are none of yours, but are injections
   of the Devil, for which he is responsible, and not you. If you strive
   against them, they are no more yours than are the cursings and
   falsehoods of rioters in the street. It is by means of these thoughts
   that the Devil would drive you to despair, or at least keep you from
   trusting Jesus. The poor diseased woman could not come to Jesus for the
   press, and you are in much the same condition, because of the rush and
   throng of these dreadful thoughts. Still, she put forth her finger, and
   touched the fringe of the Lord's garment, and she was healed. Do you
   the same.

   Jesus died for those who are guilty of "all manner of sin and
   blasphemy," and therefore I am sure He will not refuse those who are
   unwillingly the captives of evil thoughts. Cast yourself upon Him,
   thoughts and all, and see if He be not mighty to save. He can still
   those horrible whisperings of the fiend, or He can enable you to see
   them in their true light, so that you may not be worried by them. In
   His own way He can and will save you, and at length give you perfect
   peace. Only trust Him for this and everything else.

   Sadly perplexing is that form of inability which lies in a supposed
   want of power to believe. We are not strangers to the cry:

     Oh that I could believe,
     Then all would easy be;
     I would, but cannot; Lord, relieve,
     My help must come from thee.

   Many remain in the dark for years because they have no power, as they
   say, to do that which is the giving up of all power and reposing in the
   power of another, even the Lord Jesus. Indeed, it is a very curious
   thing, this whole matter of believing; for people do not get much help
   by trying to believe. Believing does not come by trying. If a person
   were to make a statement of something that happened this day, I should
   not tell him that I would try to believe him. If I believed in the
   truthfulness of the man who told the incident to me and said that he
   saw it, I should accept the statement at once. If I did not think him a
   true man, I should, of course, disbelieve him; but there would be no
   trying in the matter. Now, when God declares that there is salvation in
   Christ Jesus, I must either believe Him at once, or make Him a liar.
   Surely you will not hesitate as to which is the right path in this
   case, The witness of God must be true, and we are bound at once to
   believe in Jesus.

   But possibly you have been trying to believe too much. Now do not aim
   at great things. Be satisfied to have a faith that can hold in its hand
   this one truth, "While we were yet without strength, in due time Christ
   died for the ungodly." He laid down His life for men while as yet they
   were not believing in Him, nor were able to believe in Him. He died for
   men, not as believers, but as sinners. He came to make these sinners
   into believers and saints; but when He died for them He viewed them as
   utterly without strength. If you hold to the truth that Christ died for
   the ungodly, and believe it, your faith will save you, and you may go
   in peace. If you will trust your soul with Jesus, who died for the
   ungodly, even though you cannot believe all things, nor move mountains,
   nor do any other wonderful works, yet you are saved. It is not great
   faith, but true faith, that saves; and the salvation lies not in the
   faith, but in the Christ in whom faith trusts. Faith as a grain of
   mustard seed will bring salvation. It is not the measure of faith, but
   the sincerity of faith, which is the point to be considered. Surely a
   man can believe what he knows to be true; and as you know Jesus to be
   true, you, my friend, can believe in Him.

   The cross which is the object of faith, is also, by the power of the
   Holy Spirit, the cause of it. Sit down and watch the dying Saviour till
   faith springs up spontaneously in your heart. There is no place like
   Calvary for creating confidence. The air of that sacred hill brings
   health to trembling faith. Many a watcher there has said:

   While I view Thee, wounded, grieving, Breathless on the cursed tree,

   Lord, I feel my heart believing That Thou suffer'dst thus for me.

   "Alas!" cries another, "my want of strength lies in this direction,
   that I cannot quit my sin, and I know that I cannot go to Heaven and
   carry my sin with me." I am glad that you know that, for it is quite
   true. You must be divorced from your sin, or you cannot be married to
   Christ. Recollect the question which flashed into the mind of young
   Bunyan when at his sports on the green on Sunday: "Wilt thou have thy
   sins and go to hell, or wilt thou quit thy sins and go to heaven?" That
   brought him to a dead stand. That is a question which every man will
   have to answer: for there is no going on in sin and going to heaven.
   That cannot be. You must quit sin or quit hope. Do you reply, "Yes, I
   am willing enough. To will is present with me, but how to perform that
   which l would I find not. Sin masters me, and I have no strength."
   Come, then, if you have no strength, this text is still true, "When we
   were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
   Can you still believe that? However other things may seem to contradict
   it, will you believe it? God has said it, and it is a fact; therefore,
   hold on to it like grim death, for your only hope lies there. Believe
   this and trust Jesus, and you shall soon find power with which to slay
   your sin; but apart from Him, the strong man armed will hold you for
   ever his bond slave. Personally, I could never have overcome my own
   sinfulness. I tried and failed. My evil propensities were too many for
   me, till, in the belief that Christ died for me, I cast my guilty soul
   on Him, and then I received a conquering principle by which I overcame
   my sinful self. The doctrine of the cross can be used to slay sin, even
   as the old warriors used their huge two- handed swords, and mowed down
   their foes at every stroke. There is nothing like faith in the sinner's
   Friend: it overcomes all evil. If Christ has died for me, ungodly as I
   am, without strength as I am, then I cannot live in sin any longer, but
   must arouse myself to love and serve Him who hath redeemed me. I cannot
   trifle with the evil which slew my best Friend. I must be holy for His
   sake. How can I live in sin when He has died to save me from it?

   See what a splendid help this is to you that are without strength, to
   know and believe that in due time Christ died for such ungodly ones as
   you are. Have you caught the idea yet? It is, somehow, so difficult for
   our darkened, prejudiced, and unbelieving minds to see the essence of
   the gospel. At times I have thought, when I have done preaching, that I
   have laid down the gospel so clearly, that the nose on one's face could
   not be more plain; and yet I perceive that even intelligent hearers
   have failed to understand what was meant by "Look unto me and be ye
   saved." Converts usually say that they did not know the gospel till
   such and such a day; and yet they had heard it for years. The gospel is
   unknown, not from want of explanation, but from absence of personal
   revelation. This the Holy Ghost is ready to give, and will give to
   those who ask Him. Yet when given, the sum total of the truth revealed
   all lies within these words: "Christ died for the ungodly."

   I hear another bewailing himself thus: "Oh, sir, my weakness lies in
   this, that I do not seem to keep long in one mind! I hear the word on a
   Sunday, and I am impressed; but in the week I meet with an evil
   companion, and my good feelings are all gone. My fellow workmen do not
   believe in anything, and they say such terrible things, and I do not
   know how to answer them, and so I find myself knocked over." I know
   this Plastic Pliable very well, and I tremble for him; but at the same
   time, if he is really sincere, his weakness can be met by divine grace.
   The Holy Spirit can cast out the evil spirit of the fear of man. He can
   make the coward brave. Remember, my poor vacillating friend, you must
   not remain in this state. It will never do to be mean and beggarly to
   yourself. Stand upright, and look at yourself, and see if you were ever
   meant to be like a toad under a harrow, afraid for your life either to
   move or to stand still. Do have a mind of your own. This is not a
   spiritual matter only, but one which concerns ordinary manliness. I
   would do many things to please my friends; but to go to hell to please
   them is more than I would venture. It may be very well to do this and
   that for good fellowship; but it will never do to lose the friendship
   of God in order to keep on good terms with men. "I know that," says the
   man, "but still, though I know it, I cannot pluck up courage. I cannot
   show my colors. I cannot stand fast." Well, to you also I have the same
   text to bring: "When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ
   died for the ungodly." If Peter were here, he would say, "The Lord
   Jesus died for me even when I was such a poor weak creature that the
   maid who kept the fire drove me to lie, and to swear that I knew not
   the Lord." Yes, Jesus died for those who forsook him and fled. Take a
   firm grip on this truth--"Christ died for the ungodly while they were
   yet without strength." This is your way out of your cowardice. Get this
   wrought into your soul, "Christ died for me," and you will soon be
   ready to die for Him. Believe it, that He suffered in your place and
   stead, and offered for you a full, true, and satisfactory expiation. If
   you believe that fact, you will be forced to feel, "I cannot be ashamed
   of Him who died for me." A full conviction that this is true will nerve
   you with a dauntless courage. Look at the saints in the martyr age. In
   the early days of Christianity, when this great thought of Christ's
   exceeding love was sparkling in all its freshness in the church, men
   were not only ready to die, but they grew ambitious to suffer, and even
   presented themselves by hundreds at the judgment seats of the rulers,
   confessing the Christ. I do not say that they were wise to court a
   cruel death; but it proves my point, that a sense of the love of Jesus
   lifts the mind above all fear of what man can do to us. Why should it
   not produce the same effect in you? Oh that it might now inspire you
   with a brave resolve to come out upon the Lord's side, and be His
   follower to the end!

   May the Holy Spirit help us to come thus far by faith in the Lord
   Jesus, and it will be well!
     __________________________________________________________________

THE INCREASE OF FAITH

   HOW CAN WE OBTAIN an increase of faith? This is a very earnest question
   to many. They say they want to believe, but cannot. A great deal of
   nonsense is talked upon this subject. Let us be strictly practical in
   our dealing with it. Common sense is as much needed in religion as
   anywhere else. "What am I to do in order to believe?" One who was asked
   the best way to do a certain simple act, replied that the best way to
   do it was to do it at once. We waste time in discussing methods when
   the action is simple. The shortest way to believe is to believe. If the
   Holy Spirit has made you candid, you will believe as soon as truth is
   set before you. You will believe it because it is true. The gospel
   command is clear; "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
   saved." It is idle to evade this by questions and quibbles. The order
   is plain; let it be obeyed.

   But still, if you have difficulty, take it before God in prayer. Tell
   the great Father exactly what it is that puzzles you, and beg Him by
   His Holy Spirit to solve the question. If I cannot believe a statement
   in a book, I am glad to inquire of the author what he means by it; and
   if he is a true man his explanation will satisfy me; much more will the
   divine explanation of the hard points of Scripture satisfy the heart of
   the true seeker. The Lord is willing to make himself known; go to Him
   and see if it is not so. Repair at once to your closet, and cry, "O
   Holy Spirit, lead me into the truth! What I know not, teach Thou me."

   Furthermore, if faith seems difficult, it is possible that God the Holy
   Spirit will enable you to believe if you hear very frequently and
   earnestly that which you are commanded to believe. We believe many
   things because we have heard them so often. Do you not find it so in
   common life, that if you hear a thing fifty times a day, at last you
   come to believe it? Some men have come to believe very unlikely
   statements by this process, and therefore I do not wonder that the good
   Spirit often blesses the method of often hearing the truth, and uses it
   to work faith concerning that which is to be believed. It is written,
   "Faith cometh by hearing"; therefore hear often. If I earnestly and
   attentively hear the gospel, one of these days I shall find myself
   believing that which I hear, through the blessed operation of the
   Spirit of God upon my mind. Only mind you hear the gospel, and do not
   distract your mind with either hearing or reading that which is
   designed to stagger you.

   If that, however, should seem poor advice, I would add next, consider
   the testimony of others. The Samaritans believed because of what the
   woman told them concerning Jesus. Many of our beliefs arise out of the
   testimony of others. I believe that there is such a country as Japan; I
   never saw it, and yet I believe that there is such a place because
   others have been there. I believe that I shall die; I have never died,
   but a great many have done so whom I once knew, and therefore I have a
   conviction that I shall die also. The testimony of many convinces me of
   that fact. Listen, then, to those who tell you how they were saved, how
   they were pardoned, how they were changed in character. If you will
   look into the matter you will find that somebody just like yourself has
   been saved. If you have been a thief, you will find that a thief
   rejoiced to wash away his sin in the fountain of Christ's blood. If
   unhappily you have been unchaste, you will find that men and women who
   have fallen in that way have been cleansed and changed. If you are in
   despair, you have only to get among God's people, and inquire a little,
   and you will discover that some of the saints have been equally in
   despair at times and they will be pleased to tell you how the Lord
   delivered them. As you listen to one after another of those who have
   tried the word of God, and proved it, the divine Spirit will lead you
   to believe. Have you not heard of the African who was told by the
   missionary that water sometimes became so hard that a man could walk on
   it? He declared that he believed a great many things the missionary had
   told him; but he would never believe that. When he came to England it
   came to pass that one frosty day he saw the river frozen, but he would
   not venture on it. He knew that it was a deep river, and he felt
   certain that he would be drowned if he ventured upon it. He could not
   be induced to walk the frozen water till his friend and many others
   went upon it; then he was persuaded, and trusted himself where others
   had safely ventured. So, while you see others believe in the Lamb of
   God, and notice their joy and peace, you will yourself be gently led to
   believe. The experience of others is one of God's ways of helping us to
   faith. You have either to believe in Jesus or die; there is no hope for
   you but in Him.

   A better plan is this--note the authority upon which you are commanded
   to believe, and this will greatly help you to faith. The authority is
   not mine, or you might well reject it. But you are commanded to believe
   upon the authority of God himself. He bids you believe in Jesus Christ,
   and you must not refuse to obey your Maker. The foreman of a certain
   works had often heard the gospel, but he was troubled with the fear
   that he might not come to Christ. His good master one day sent a card
   around to the works--"Come to my house immediately after work." The
   foreman appeared at his master's door, and the master came out, and
   said somewhat roughly, "What do you want, John, troubling me at this
   time? Work is done, what right have you here?" "Sir," said he, "I had a
   card from you saying that I was to come after work." "Do you mean to
   say that merely because you had a card from me you are to come up to my
   house and call me out after business hours?" "Well, Sir," replied the
   foreman, "I do not understand you, but it seems to me that, as you sent
   for me, I had a right to come." "Come in, John," said his master, "I
   have another message that I want to read to you," and he sat down and
   read these words: "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
   and I will give you rest." "Do you think after such a message from
   Christ that you can be wrong in coming to him?" The poor man saw it all
   at once, and believed in the Lord Jesus unto eternal life, because he
   perceived that he had good warrant and authority for believing. So have
   you, poor soul! You have good authority for coming to Christ, for the
   Lord himself bids you trust Him.

   If that does not breed faith in you, think over what it is that you
   have to believe--that the Lord Jesus Christ suffered in the place and
   stead of sinners, and is able to save all who trust Him. Why, this is
   the most blessed fact that ever men were told to believe; the most
   suitable, the most comforting, the most divine truth that was ever set
   before mortal minds. I advise you to think much upon it, and search out
   the grace and love which it contains. Study the four Evangelists, study
   Paul's epistles, and then see if the message is not such a credible one
   that you are forced to believe it.

   If that does not do, then think upon the person of Jesus Christ--think
   of who He is, and what He did, and where He is, and what He is. How can
   you doubt Him? It is cruelty to distrust the ever truthful Jesus. He
   has done nothing to deserve distrust; on the contrary, it should be
   easy to rely upon Him. Why crucify Him anew by unbelief? Is not this
   crowning Him with thorns again, and spitting upon Him again? What! is
   He not to be trusted? What worse insult did the soldiers pour upon Him
   than this? They made Him a martyr; but you make Him a liar--this is
   worse by far. Do not ask how can I believe? But answer another
   question--How can you disbelieve?

   If none of these things avail, then there is something wrong about you
   altogether, and my last word is, submit yourself to God! Prejudice or
   pride is at the bottom of this unbelief. May the Spirit of God take
   away your enmity and make you yield. You are a rebel, a proud rebel,
   and that is why you do not believe your God. Give up your rebellion;
   throw down your weapons; yield at discretion, surrender to your King. I
   believe that never did a soul throw up its hands in self-despair, and
   cry, "Lord, I yield," but what faith became easy to it before long. It
   is because you still have a quarrel with God, and resolve to have your
   own will and your own way, that therefore you cannot believe. "How can
   ye believe," said Christ, "that have honor one of another?" Proud self
   creates unbelief. Submit, O man. Yield to your God, and then shall you
   sweetly believe in your Saviour. May the Holy Ghost now work secretly
   but effectually with you, and bring you at this very moment to believe
   in the Lord Jesus! Amen.

REGENERATION AND THE HOLY SPIRIT

   YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN." This word of our Lord Jesus has appeared to
   flame in the way of many, like the drawn sword of the cherub at the
   gate of Paradise. They have despaired, because this change is beyond
   their utmost effort. The new birth is from above, and therefore it is
   not in the creature's power. Now, it is far from my mind to deny, or
   ever to conceal, a truth in order to create a false comfort. I freely
   admit that the new birth is supernatural, and that it cannot be wrought
   by the sinner's own self. It would be a poor help to my reader if I
   were wicked enough to try to cheer him by persuading him to reject or
   forget what is unquestionably true.

   But is it not remarkable that the very chapter in which our Lord makes
   this sweeping declaration also contains the most explicit statement as
   to salvation by faith? Read the third chapter of John's Gospel and do
   not dwell alone upon its earlier sentences. It is true that the third
   verse says:

   Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
   Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

   But, then, the fourteenth and fifteenth verses speak:

   And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the
   Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not
   perish, but have eternal life.

   The eighteenth verse repeats the same doctrine in the broadest terms:

   He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is
   condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
   begotten Son of God.

   It is clear to every reader that these two statements must agree, since
   they came from the same lips, and are recorded on the same inspired
   page. Why should we make a difficulty where there can be none? If one
   statement assures us of the necessity to salvation of a something,
   which only God can give, and if another assures us that the Lord will
   save us upon our believing in Jesus, then we may safely conclude that
   the Lord will give to those who believe all that is declared to be
   necessary to salvation. The Lord does, in fact, produce the new birth
   in all who believe in Jesus; and their believing is the surest evidence
   that they are born again.

   We trust in Jesus for what we cannot do ourselves: if it were in our
   own power, what need of looking to Him? It is ours to believe, it is
   the Lord's to create us anew. He will not believe for us, neither are
   we to do regenerating work for Him. It is enough for us to obey the
   gracious command; it is for the Lord to work the new birth in us. He
   who could go so far as to die on the cross for us, can and will give us
   all things that are needful for our eternal safety.

   "But a saving change of heart is the work of the Holy Spirit." This
   also is most true, and let it be far from us to question it, or to
   forget it. But the work of the Holy Spirit is secret and mysterious,
   and it can only be perceived by its results. There are mysteries about
   our natural birth into which it would be an unhallowed curiosity to
   pry: still more is this the case with the sacred operations of the
   Spirit of God. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the
   sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, or whither it
   goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit." This much, however,
   we do know--the mysterious work of the Holy Spirit cannot be a reason
   for refusing to believe in Jesus to whom that same Spirit beareth
   witness.

   If a man were bidden to sow a field, he could not excuse his neglect by
   saying that it would be useless to sow unless God caused the seed to
   grow. He would not be justified in neglecting tillage because the
   secret energy of God alone can create a harvest. No one is hindered in
   the ordinary pursuits of life by the fact that unless the Lord build
   the house they labor in vain that build it. It is certain that no man
   who believes in Jesus will ever find that the Holy Spirit refuses to
   work in him: in fact, his believing is the proof that the Spirit is
   already at work in his heart.

   God works in providence, but men do not therefore sit still. They could
   not move without the divine power giving them life and strength, and
   yet they proceed upon their way without question; the power being
   bestowed from day to day by Him in whose hand their breath is, and
   whose are all their ways. So is it in grace. We repent and believe,
   though we could do neither if the Lord did not enable us. We forsake
   sin and trust in Jesus, and then we perceive that the Lord has wrought
   in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure. It is idle to pretend
   that there is any real difficulty in the matter.

   Some truths which it is hard to explain in words are simple enough in
   actual experience. There is no discrepancy between the truth that the
   sinner believes, and that his faith is wrought in him by the Holy
   Spirit. Only folly can lead men to puzzle themselves about plain
   matters while their souls are in danger. No man would refuse to enter a
   lifeboat because he did not know the specific gravity of bodies;
   neither would a starving man decline to eat till he understood the
   whole process of mutrition. If you, my reader, will not believe till
   you can understand all mysteries, you will never be saved at all; and
   if you allow self- invented difficulties to keep you from accepting
   pardon through your Lord and Saviour, you will perish in a condemnation
   which will be richly deserved. Do not commit spiritual suicide through
   a passion for discussing metaphysical subtleties.

"MY REDEEMER LIVETH"

   CONTINUALLY have I spoken to the reader concerning Christ crucified,
   who is the great hope of the guilty; but it is our wisdom to remember
   that our Lord has risen from the dead and lives eternally.

   You are not asked to trust in a dead Jesus, but in One who, though He
   died for our sins, has risen again for our justification. You may go to
   Jesus at once as to a living and present friend. He is not a mere
   memory, but a continually existent Person who will hear your prayers
   and answer them. He lives on purpose to carry on the work for which He
   once laid down His life. He is interceding for sinners at the right
   hand of the Father, and for this reason He is able to save them to the
   uttermost who come unto God by Him. Come and try this living Saviour,
   if you have never done so before.

   This living Jesus is also raised to an eminence of glory and power. He
   does not now sorrow as "a humble man before his foes," nor labor as
   "the carpenter's son"; but He is exalted far above principalities and
   power and every name that is named. The Father has given Him all power
   in Heaven and in earth, and he exercises this high endowment in
   carrying out His work of grace. Hear what Peter and the other apostles
   testified concerning Him before the high priest and the council:

   The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a
   tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
   Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins
   (Acts 5:30, 31).

   The glory which surrounds the ascended Lord should breathe hope into
   every believer's breast. Jesus is no mean person--He is "a Saviour and
   a great one." He is the crowned and enthroned Redeemer of men. The
   sovereign prerogative of life and death is vested in Him; the Father
   has put all men under the mediatorial government of the Son, so that He
   can quicken whom He will. He openeth, and no man shutteth. At His word
   the soul which is bound by the cords of sin and condemnation can be
   unloosed in a moment. He stretches out the silver scepter, and
   whosoever touches it lives.

   It is well for us that as sin lives, and the flesh lives, and the devil
   lives, so Jesus lives; and it is also well that whatever might these
   may have to ruin us, Jesus has still greater power to save us.

   All His exaltation and ability are on our account. "He is exalted to
   be," and exalted "to give." He is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour,
   that He may give all that is needed to accomplish the salvation of all
   who come under His rule. Jesus has nothing which He will not use for a
   sinner's salvation, and He is nothing which He will not display in the
   aboundings of His grace. He links His princedom with His Saviour-ship,
   as if He would not have the one without the other; and He sets forth
   His exaltation as designed to bring blessings to men, as if this were
   the flower and crown of His glory. Could anything be more calculated to
   raise the hopes of seeking sinners who are looking Christward?

   Jesus endured great humiliation, and therefore there was room for Him
   to be exalted. By that humiliation He accomplished and endured all the
   Father's will, and therefore He was rewarded by being raised to glory.
   He uses that exaltation on behalf of His people. Let my reader raise
   his eyes to these hills of glory, whence his help must come. Let him
   contemplate the high glories of the Prince and Saviour. Is it not most
   hopeful for men that a Man is now on the throne of the universe? Is it
   not glorious that the Lord of all is the Saviour of sinners? We have a
   Friend at court; yea, a Friend on the throne. He will use all His
   influence for those who entrust their affairs in His hands. Well does
   one of our poets sing:


   He ever lives to intercede

   Before His Father's face;

   Give Him, my soul, Thy cause to plead,

   No doubt the Father's grace.

   Come, friend, and commit your cause and your case to those once pierced
   hands, which are now glorified with the signet rings of royal power and
   honor. No suit ever failed which was left with this great Advocate.
     __________________________________________________________________

REPENTANCE MUST GO WITH FORGIVENESS

   IT IS CLEAR from the text which we have lately quoted that repentance
   is bound up with the forgiveness of sins. In Acts 5:31 we read that
   Jesus is "exalted to give repentance and forgiveness of sins." These
   two blessings come from that sacred hand which once was nailed to the
   tree, but is now raised to glory. Repentance and forgiveness are
   riveted together by the eternal purpose of God. What God hath joined
   together let no man put asunder.

   Repentance must go with remission, and you will see that it is so if
   you think a little upon the matter. It cannot be that pardon of sin
   should be given to an impenitent sinner; this were to confirm him in
   his evil ways, and to teach him to think little of evil. If the Lord
   were to say, "You love sin, and live in it, and you are going on from
   bad to worse, but, all the same, I forgive you," this were to proclaim
   a horrible license for iniquity. The foundations of social order would
   be removed, and moral anarchy would follow. I cannot tell what
   innumerable mischiefs would certainly occur if you could divide
   repentance and forgiveness, and pass by the sin while the sinner
   remained as fond of it as ever. In the very nature of things, if we
   believe in the holiness of God, it must be so, that if we continue in
   our sin, and will not repent of it, we cannot be forgiven, but must
   reap the consequence of our obstinacy. According to the infinite
   goodness of God, we are promised that if we will forsake our sins,
   confessing them, and will, by faith, accept the grace which is provided
   in Christ Jesus, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and
   to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. But, so long as God lives,
   there can be no promise of mercy to those who continue in their evil
   ways, and refuse to acknowledge their wrongdoing. Surely no rebel can
   expect the King to pardon his treason while he remains in open revolt.
   No one can be so foolish as to imagine that the Judge of all the earth
   will put away our sins if we refuse to put them away ourselves.

   Moreover, it must be so for the completeness of divine mercy. That
   mercy which could forgive the sin and yet let the sinner live in it
   would be scant and superficial mercy. It would be unequal and deformed
   mercy, lame upon one of its feet, and withered as to one of its hands.
   Which, think you, is the greater privilege, cleansing from the guilt of
   sin, or deliverance from the power of sin? I will not attempt to weigh
   in the scales two mercies so surpassing. Neither of them could have
   come to us apart from the precious blood of Jesus. But it seems to me
   that to be delivered from the dominion of sin, to be made holy, to be
   made like to God, must be reckoned the greater of the two, if a
   comparison has to be drawn. To be forgiven is an immeasurable favor. We
   make this one of the first notes of our psalm of praise: "Who forgiveth
   all thine iniquities." But if we could be forgiven, and then could be
   permitted to love sin, to riot in iniquity, and to wallow in lust, what
   would be the use of such a forgiveness? Might it not turn out to be a
   poisoned sweet, which would most effectually destroy us? To be washed,
   and yet to lie in the mire; to be pronounced clean, and yet to have the
   leprosy white on one's brow, would be the veriest mockery of mercy.
   What is it to bring the man out of his sepulcher if you leave him dead?
   Why lead him into the light if he is still blind? We thank God, that He
   who forgives our iniquities also heals our diseases. He who washes us
   from the stains of the past also uplifts us from the foul ways of the
   present, and keeps us from failing in the future. We must joyfully
   accept both repentance and remission; they cannot be separated. The
   covenant heritage is one and indivisible, and must not be parceled out.
   To divide the work of grace would be to cut the living child in halves,
   and those who would permit this have no interest in it.

   I will ask you who are seeking the Lord, whether you would be satisfied
   with one of these mercies alone? Would it content you, my reader, if
   God would forgive you your sin and then allow you to be as worldly and
   wicked as before? Oh, no! The quickened spirit is more afraid of sin
   itself than of the penal results of it. The cry of your heart is not,
   "Who shall deliver me from punishment?" but, "O wretched man that I am!
   Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Who shall enable me
   to live above temptation, and to become holy, even as God is holy?"
   Since the unity of repentance with remission agrees with gracious
   desire, and since it is necessary for the completeness of salvation,
   and for holiness' sake, rest you sure that it abides.

   Repentance and forgiveness are joined together in the experience of all
   believers. There never was a person yet who did unfeignedly repent of
   sin with believing repentance who was not forgiven; and on the other
   hand, there never was a person forgiven who had not repented of his
   sin. I do not hesitate to say that beneath the copes of Heaven there
   never was, there is not, and there never will be, any case of sin being
   washed away, unless at the same time the heart was led to repentance
   and faith in Christ. Hatred of sin and a sense of pardon come together
   into the soul, and abide together while we live.

   These two things act and react upon each other: the man who is
   forgiven, therefore repents; and the man who repents is also most
   assuredly forgiven. Remember first, that forgiveness leads to
   repentance. As we sing in Hart's words:

     Law and terrors do but harden,
     All the while they work alone;
     But a sense of blood-bought pardon
     Soon dissolves a heart of stone.

   When we are sure that we are forgiven, then we abhor iniquity; and I
   suppose that when faith grows into full assurance, so that we are
   certain beyond a doubt that the blood of Jesus has washed us whiter
   than snow, it is then that repentance reaches to its greatest height.
   Repentance grows as faith grows. Do not make any mistake about it;
   repentance is not a thing of days and weeks, a temporary penance to be
   over as fast as possible! No; it is the grace of a lifetime, like faith
   itself. God's little children repent, and so do the young men and the
   fathers. Repentance is the inseparable companion of faith. All the
   while that we walk by faith and not by sight, the tear of repentance
   glitters in the eye of faith. That is not true repentance which does
   not come of faith in Jesus, and that is not true faith in Jesus which
   is not tinctured with repentance. Faith and repentance, like Siamese
   twins, are vitally joined together. In proportion as we believe in the
   forgiving love of Christ, in that proportion we repent; and in
   proportion as we repent of sin and hate evil, we rejoice in the
   fullness of the absolution which Jesus is exalted to bestow. You will
   never value pardon unless you feel repentance; and you will never taste
   the deepest draught of repentance until you know that you are pardoned.
   It may seem a strange thing, but so it is--the bitterness of repentance
   and the sweetness of pardon blend in the flavor of every gracious life,
   and make up an incomparable happiness.

   These two covenant gifts are the mutual assurance of each other. If I
   know that I repent, I know that I am forgiven. How am I to know that I
   am forgiven except I know also that I am turned from my former sinful
   course? To be a believer is to be a penitent. Faith and repentance are
   but two spokes in the same wheel, two handles of the same plough.
   Repentance has been well described as a heart broken for sin, and from
   sin; and it may equally well be spoken of as turning and returning. It
   is a change of mind of the most thorough and radical sort, and it is
   attended with sorrow for the past, and a resolve of amendment in the
   future.


   Repentance is to leave

   The sins we loved before;

   And show that we in earnest grieve,

   By doing so no more.

   Now, when that is the case, we may be certain that we are forgiven; for
   the Lord never made a heart to be broken for sin and broken from sin,
   without pardoning it. If, on the other hand, we are enjoying pardon,
   through the blood of Jesus, and are justified by faith, and have peace
   with God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, we know that our repentance
   and faith are of the right sort.

   Do not regard your repentance as the cause of your remission, but as
   the companion of it. Do not expect to be able to repent until you see
   the grace of our Lord Jesus, and His readiness to blot out your sin.
   Keep these blessed things in their places, and view them in their
   relation to each other. They are the Jachin and Boaz of a saving
   experience; I mean that they are comparable to Solomon's two great
   pillars which stood in the forefront of the house of the Lord, and
   formed a majestic entrance to the holy place. No man comes to God
   aright except he passes between the pillars of repentance and
   remission. Upon your heart the rainbow of covenant grace has been
   displayed in all its beauty when the tear-drops of repentance have been
   shone upon by the light of full forgiveness. Repentance of sin and
   faith in divine pardon are the warp and woof of the fabric of real
   conversion. By these tokens shall you know an Israelite indeed.

   To come back to the Scripture upon which we are meditating: both
   forgiveness and repentance flow from the same source, and are given by
   the same Saviour. The Lord Jesus in His glory bestows both upon the
   same persons. You are neither to find the remission nor the repentance
   elsewhere. Jesus has both ready, and He is prepared to bestow them now,
   and to bestow them most freely on all who will accept them at His
   hands. Let it never be forgotten that Jesus gives all that is needful
   for our salvation. It is highly important that all seekers after mercy
   should remember this. Faith is as much the gift of God as is the
   Saviour upon whom that faith relies. Repentance of sin is as truly the
   work of grace as the making of an atonement by which sin is blotted
   out. Salvation, from first to last, is of grace alone. You will not
   misunderstand me. It is not the Holy Spirit who repents. He has never
   done anything for which He should repent. If He could repent, it would
   not meet the case; we must ourselves repent of our own sin, or we are
   not saved from its power. It is not the Lord Jesus Christ who repents.
   What should He repent of? We ourselves repent with the full consent of
   every faculty of our mind. The will, the affections, the emotions, all
   work together most heartily in the blessed act of repentance for sin;
   and yet at the back of all that is our personal act, there is a secret
   holy influence which melts the heart, gives contrition, and produces a
   complete change. The Spirit of God enlightens us to see what sin is,
   and thus makes it loathsome in our eyes. The Spirit of God also turns
   us toward holiness, makes us heartily to appreciate, love, and desire
   it, and thus gives us the impetus by which we are led onward from stage
   to stage of sanctification. The Spirit of God works in us to will and
   to do according to God's good pleasure. To that good Spirit let us
   submit ourselves at once, that He may lead us to Jesus, who will freely
   give us the double benediction of repentance and remission, according
   to the riches of His grace.

   "BY GRACE ARE YE SAVED."
     __________________________________________________________________

HOW REPENTANCE IS GIVEN

   TO RETURN to the grand text: "Him hath God exalted with his right hand
   to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and
   forgiveness of sins." Our Lord Jesus Christ has gone up that grace may
   come down. His glory is employed to give greater currency to His grace.
   The Lord has not taken a step upward except with the design of bearing
   believing sinners upward with Him. He is exalted to give repentance;
   and this we shall see if we remember a few great truths.

   The work which our Lord Jesus has done has made repentance possible,
   available, and acceptable. The law makes no mention of repentance, but
   says plainly, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." If the Lord Jesus
   had not died and risen again and gone unto the Father, what would your
   repenting or mine be worth? We might feel remorse with its horrors, but
   never repentance with its hopes. Repentance, as a natural feeling, is a
   common duty deserving no great praise: indeed, it is so generally
   mingled with a selfish fear of punishment, that the kindliest estimate
   makes but little of it. Had not Jesus interposed and wrought out a
   wealth of merit, our tears of repentance would have been so much water
   spilled upon the ground. Jesus is exalted on high, that through the
   virtue of His intercession repentance may have a place before God. In
   this respect He gives us repentance, because He puts repentance into a
   position of acceptance, which otherwise it could never have occupied.

   When Jesus was exalted on high, the Spirit of God was poured out to
   work in us all needful graces. The Holy Ghost creates repentance in us
   by supernaturally renewing our nature, and taking away the heart of
   stone out of our flesh. Oh, sit not down straining those eyes of yours
   to fetch out impossible tears! Repentance comes not from unwilling
   nature, but from free and sovereign grace. Get not to your chamber to
   smite your breast in order to fetch from a heart of stone feelings
   which are not there. But go to Calvary and see how Jesus died. Look
   upward to the hills whence comes your help. The Holy Ghost has come on
   purpose that He may overshadow men's spirits and breed repentance
   within them, even as once He brooded over chaos and brought forth
   order. Breathe your prayer to Him, "Blessed Spirit, dwell with me. Make
   me tender and lowly of heart, that I may hate sin and unfeignedly
   repent of it." He will hear your cry and answer you.

   Remember, too, that when our Lord Jesus was exalted, He not only gave
   us repentance by sending forth the Holy Spirit, but by consecrating all
   the works of nature and of providence to the great ends of our
   salvation, so that any one of them may call us to repentance, whether
   it crow like Peter's cock, or shake the prison like the jailer's
   earthquake. From the right hand of God our Lord Jesus rules all things
   here below, and makes them work together for the salvation of His
   redeemed. He uses both bitters and sweets, trials and joys, that He may
   produce in sinners a better mind toward their God. Be thankful for the
   providence which has made you poor, or sick, or sad; for by all this
   Jesus works the life of your spirit and turns you to Himself. The
   Lord's mercy often rides to the door of our hearts on the black horse
   of affliction. Jesus uses the whole range of our experience to wean us
   from earth and woo us to Heaven. Christ is exalted to the throne of
   Heaven and earth in order that, by all the processes of His providence,
   He may subdue hard hearts unto the gracious softening of repentance.

   Besides, He is at work at this hour by all His whispers in the
   conscience, by His inspired Book, by those of us who speak out of that
   Book, and by praying friends and earnest hearts. He can send a word to
   you which shall strike your rocky heart as with the rod of Moses, and
   cause streams of repentance to flow forth. He can bring to your mind
   some heart-breaking text out of Holy Scripture which shall conquer you
   right speedily. He can mysteriously soften you, and cause a holy frame
   of mind to steal over you when you least look for it. Be sure of this,
   that He who is gone into His glory, raised into all the splendor and
   majesty of God, has abundant ways of working repentance in those to
   whom He grants forgiveness. He is even now waiting to give repentance
   to you. Ask Him for it at once.

   Observe with much comfort that the Lord Jesus Christ gives this
   repentance to the most unlikely people in the world. He is exalted to
   give repentance to Israel. To Israel! In the days when the apostles
   thus spoke, Israel was the nation which had most grossly sinned against
   light and love, by daring to say, "His blood be on us and on our
   children." Yet Jesus is exalted to give them repentance! What a marvel
   of grace! If you have been brought up in the brightest of Christian
   light, and yet have rejected it, there is still hope. If you have
   sinned against conscience, and against the Holy Spirit, and against the
   love of Jesus, there is yet space for repentance. Though you may be as
   hard as unbelieving Israel of old, softening may yet come to you, since
   Jesus is exalted, and clothed with boundless power. For those who went
   the furthest in iniquity, and sinned with special aggravation, the Lord
   Jesus is exalted to give to them repentance and forgiveness of sins.
   Happy am I to have so full a gospel to proclaim! Happy are you to be
   allowed to read it!

   The hearts of the children of Israel had grown hard as an adamant
   stone. Luther used to think it impossible to convert a Jew. We are far
   from agreeing with him, and yet we must admit that the seed of Israel
   have been exceedingly obstinate in their rejection of the Saviour
   during these many centuries. Truly did the Lord say, "Israel would none
   of me." "He came to his own and his own received him not." Yet on
   behalf of Israel our Lord Jesus is exalted for the giving of repentance
   and remission. Probably my reader is a Gentile; but yet he may have a
   very stubborn heart, which has stood out against the Lord Jesus for
   many years; and yet in him our Lord can work repentance. It may be that
   you will yet feel compelled to write as William Hone did when he
   yielded to divine love. He was the author of those most entertaining
   volumes called the "Everyday Book," but he was once a stout-hearted
   infidel. When subdued by sovereign grace, he wrote:


   The proudest heart that ever beat

   Hath been subdued in me;

   The wildest will that ever rose

   To scorn Thy cause and aid Thy foes

   Is quell'd my Lord, by Thee.

   Thy will, and not my will be done,

   My heart be ever Thine;

   Confessing Thee the mighty Word,

   My Saviour Christ, my God, my Lord,

   Thy cross shall be my sign.

   The Lord can give repentance to the most unlikely, turning lions into
   lambs, and ravens into doves. Let us look to Him that this great change
   may be wrought in us. Assuredly the contemplation of the death of
   Christ is one of the surest and speediest methods of gaining
   repentance. Do not sit down and try to pump up repentance from the dry
   well of corrupt nature. It is contrary to the laws of mind to suppose
   that you can force your soul into that gracious state. Take your heart
   in prayer to Him who understands it, and say, "Lord, cleanse it. Lord,
   renew it. Lord, work repentance in it." The more you try to produce
   penitent emotions in yourself, the more you will be disappointed; but
   if you believingly think of Jesus dying for you, repentance will burst
   forth. Meditate on the Lord's shedding His heart's blood out of love to
   you. Set before your mind's eye the agony and bloody sweat, the cross
   and passion; and, as you do this, He who was the bearer of all this
   grief will look at you, and with that look He will do for you what He
   did for Peter, so that you also will go out and weep bitterly. He who
   died for you can, by His gracious Spirit, make you die to sin; and He
   who has gone into glory on your behalf can draw your soul after Him,
   away from evil, and toward holiness.

   I shall be content if I leave this one thought with you; look not
   beneath the ice to find fire, neither hope in your own natural heart to
   find repentance. Look to the Living One for life. Look to Jesus for all
   you need between Hell Gate and Heaven Gate. Never seek elsewhere for
   any part of that which Jesus loves to bestow; but remember,

   Christ is all.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FEAR OF FINAL FALLING

   A DARK FEAR haunts the minds of many who are coming to Christ; they are
   afraid that they shall not persevere to the end. I have heard the
   seeker say: "If I were to cast my soul upon Jesus, yet peradventure I
   should after all draw back into perdition. I have had good feelings
   before now, and they have died away. My goodness has been as the
   morning cloud, and as the early dew. It has come on a sudden, lasted
   for a season, promised much, and then vanished away."

   I believe that this fear is often the father of the fact; and that some
   who have been afraid to trust Christ for all time, and for all
   eternity, have failed because they had a temporary faith, which never
   went far enough to save them. They set out trusting to Jesus in a
   measure, but looking to themselves for continuance and perseverance in
   the heavenward way; and so they set out faultily, and, as a natural
   consequence, turned back before long. If we trust to ourselves for our
   holding on we shall not hold on. Even though we rest in Jesus for a
   part of our salvation, we shall fail if we trust to self for anything.
   No chain is stronger than its weakest link: if Jesus be our hope for
   everything, except one thing, we shall utterly fail, because in that
   one point we shall come to nought. I have no doubt whatever that a
   mistake about the perseverance of the saints has prevented the
   perseverance of many who did run well. What did hinder them that they
   should not continue to run? They trusted to themselves for that
   running, and so they stopped short. Beware of mixing even a little of
   self with the mortar with which you build, or you will make it
   untempered mortar, and the stones will not hold together. If you look
   to Christ for your beginnings, beware of looking to yourself for your
   endings. He is Alpha. See to it that you make Him Omega also. If you
   begin in the Spirit you must not hope to be made perfect by the flesh.
   Begin as you mean to go on, and go on as you began, and let the Lord be
   all in all to you. Oh, that God, the Holy Spirit, may give us a very
   clear idea of where the strength must come from by which we shall be
   preserved until the day of our Lord's appearing!

   Here is what Paul once said upon this subject when he was writing to
   the Corinthians:

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye
   may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful,
   by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our
   Lord (1 Cor. 1:8, 9).

   This language silently admits a great need, by telling us how it is
   provided for. Wherever the Lord makes a provision, we are quite sure
   that there was a need for it, since no superfluities encumber the
   covenant of grace. Golden shields hung in Solomon's courts which were
   never used, but there are none such in the armory of God. What God has
   provided we shall surely need. Between this hour and the consummation
   of all things every promise of God and every provision of the covenant
   of grace will be brought into requisition. The urgent need of the
   believing soul is confirmation, continuance, final perseverance,
   preservation to the end. This is the great necessity of the most
   advanced believers, for Paul was writing to saints at Corinth, who were
   men of a high order, of whom he could say, "I thank my God always on
   your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ."
   Such men are the very persons who most assuredly feel that they have
   daily need of new grace if they are to hold on, and hold out, and come
   off conquerors at the last. If you were not saints you would have no
   grace, and you would feel no need of more grace; but because you are
   men of God, therefore you feel the daily demands of the spiritual life.
   The marble statue requires no food; but the living man hungers and
   thirsts, and he rejoices that his bread and his water are made sure to
   him, for else he would certainly faint by the way. The believer's
   personal wants make it inevitable that he should daily draw from the
   great source of all supplies; for what could he do if he could not
   resort to his God?

   This is true of the most gifted of the saints--of those men at Corinth
   who were enriched with all utterance and with all knowledge. They
   needed to be confirmed to the end, or else their gifts and attainments
   would prove their ruin. If we had the tongues of men and of angels, if
   we did not receive fresh grace, where should we be? If we had all
   experience till we were fathers in the church--if we had been taught of
   God so as to understand all mysteries--yet we could not live a single
   day without the divine life flowing into us from our Covenant Head. How
   could we hope to hold on for a single hour, to say nothing of a
   lifetime, unless the Lord should hold us on? He who began the good work
   in us must perform it unto the day of Christ, or it will prove a
   painful failure.

   This great necessity arises very much from our own selves. In some
   there is a painful fear that they shall not persevere in grace because
   they know their own fickleness. Certain persons are constitutionally
   unstable. Some men are by nature conservative, not to say obstinate;
   but others are as naturally variable and volatile. Like butterflies
   they flit from flower to flower, till they visit all the beauties of
   the garden, and settle upon none of them. They are never long enough in
   one place to do any good; not even in their business nor in their
   intellectual pursuits. Such persons may well be afraid that ten,
   twenty, thirty, forty, perhaps fifty years of continuous religious
   watchfulness will be a great deal too much for them. We see men joining
   first one church and then another, till they box the compass. They are
   everything by turns and nothing long. Such have double need to pray
   that they may be divinely confirmed, and may be made not only steadfast
   but unmoveable, or otherwise they will not be found "always abounding
   in the work of the Lord."

   All of us, even if we have no constitutional temptation to fickleness,
   must feel our own weakness if we are really quickened of God. Dear
   reader, do you not find enough in any one single day to make you
   stumble? You that desire to walk in perfect holiness, as I trust you
   do; you that have set before you a high standard of what a Christian
   should be--do you not find that before the breakfast things are cleared
   away from the table, you have displayed enough folly to make you
   ashamed of yourselves? If we were to shut ourselves up in the lone cell
   of a hermit, temptation would follow us; for as long as we cannot
   escape from ourselves we cannot escape from incitements to sin. There
   is that within our hearts which should make us watchful and humble
   before God. If he does not confirm us, we are so weak that we shall
   stumble and fall; not overturned by an enemy, but by our own
   carelessness. Lord, be thou our strength. We are weakness itself.

   Besides that, there is the weariness which comes of a long life. When
   we begin our Christian profession we mount up with wings as eagles,
   further on we run without weariness; but in our best and truest days we
   walk without fainting. Our pace seems slower, but it is more
   serviceable and better sustained. I pray God that the energy of our
   youth may continue with us so far as it is the energy of the Spirit and
   not the mere fermentation of proud flesh. He that has long been on the
   road to Heaven finds that there was good reason why it was promised
   that his shoes should be iron and brass, for the road is rough. He has
   discovered that there are Hills of Difficulty and Valleys of
   Humiliation; that there is a Vale of Deathshade, and, worse still, a
   Vanity Fair--and all these are to be traversed. If there be Delectable
   Mountains (and, thank God, there are,) there are also Castles of
   Despair, the inside of which pilgrims have too often seen. Considering
   all things, those who hold out to the end in the way of holiness will
   be "men wondered at."

   "O world of wonders, I can say no less." The days of a Christian's life
   are like so many Koh-i-noors of mercy threaded upon the golden string
   of divine faithfulness. In Heaven we shall tell to angels, and
   principalities, and powers, the unsearchable riches of Christ which
   were spent upon us, and enjoyed by us while we were here below. We have
   been kept alive on the brink of death. Our spiritual life has been a
   flame burning on in the midst of the sea, a stone that has remained
   suspended in the air. It will amaze the universe to see us enter the
   pearly gate, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. We ought to
   be full of grateful wonder if kept for an hour; and I trust we are.

   If this were all, there would be enough cause for anxiety; but there is
   far more. We have to think of what a place we live in. The world is a
   howling wilderness to many of God's people. Some of us are greatly
   indulged in the providence of God, but others have a stern fight of it.
   We begin our day with prayer, and we hear the voice of holy song full
   often in our houses; but many good people have scarcely risen from
   their knees in the morning before they are saluted with blasphemy. They
   go out to work, and all day long they are vexed with filthy
   conversation like righteous Lot in Sodom. Can you even walk the open
   streets without your ears being afflicted with foul language? The world
   is no friend to grace. The best we can do with this world is to get
   through it as quickly as we can, for we dwell in an enemy's country. A
   robber lurks in every bush. Everywhere we need to travel with a "drawn
   sword" in our hand, or at least with that weapon which is called
   all-prayer ever at our side; for we have to contend for every inch of
   our way. Make no mistake about this, or you will be rudely shaken out
   of your fond delusion. O God, help us, and confirm us to the end, or
   where shall we be?

   True religion is supernatural at its beginning, supernatural in its
   continuance, and supernatural in its close. It is the work of God from
   first to last. There is great need that the hand of the Lord should be
   stretched out still: that need my reader is feeling now, and I am glad
   that he should feel it; for now he will look for his own preservation
   to the Lord who alone is able to keep us from failing, and glorify us
   with His Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

CONFIRMATION

   I WANT YOU TO NOTICE the security which Paul confidently expected for
   all the saints. He says--"Who shall confirm you unto the end, that ye
   may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ." This is the kind
   of confirmation which is above all things to be desired. You see it
   supposes that the persons are right, and it proposes to confirm them in
   the right. It would be an awful thing to confirm a man in ways of sin
   and error. Think of a confirmed drunkard, or a confirmed thief, or a
   confirmed liar. It would be a deplorable thing for a man to be
   confirmed in unbelief and ungodliness. Divine confirmation can only be
   enjoyed by those to whom the grace of God has been already manifested.
   It is the work of the Holy Ghost. He who gives faith strengthens and
   establishes it: He who kindles love in us preserves it and increases
   its flame. What He makes us to know by His first teaching, the good
   Spirit causes us to know with greater clearness and certainty by still
   further instruction. Holy acts are confirmed till they become habits,
   and holy feelings are confirmed till they become abiding conditions.
   Experience and practice confirm our beliefs and our resolutions. Both
   our joys and our sorrows, our successes and our failures, are
   sanctified to the selfsame end: even as the tree is helped to root
   itself both by the soft showers and the rough winds. The mind is
   instructed, and in its growing knowledge it gathers reasons for
   persevering in the good way: the heart is comforted, and so it is made
   to cling more closely to the consoling truth. The grip grows tighter,
   and the tread grows firmer, and the man himself becomes more solid and
   substantial.

   This is not a merely natural growth, but is as distinct a work of the
   Spirit as conversion. The Lord will surely give it to those who are
   relying upon Him for eternal life. By His inward working He will
   deliver us from being "unstable as water," and cause us to be rooted
   and grounded. It is a part of the method by which He saves us--this
   building us up into Christ Jesus and causing us to abide in Him. Dear
   reader, you may daily look for this; and you shall not be disappointed.
   He whom you trust will make you to be as a tree planted by the rivers
   of waters, so preserved that even your leaf shall not wither.

   What a strength to a church is a confirmed Christian! He is a comfort
   to the sorrowful, and a help to the weak. Would you not like to be
   such? Confirmed believers are pillars in the house of our God. These
   are not carried away by every wind of doctrine, nor overthrown by
   sudden temptation. They are a great stay to others, and act as anchors
   in the time of church trouble. You who are beginning the holy life
   hardly dare to hope that you will become like them. But you need not
   fear; the good Lord will work in you as well as in them. One of these
   days you who are now a "babe" in Christ shall be a "father" in the
   church. Hope for this great thing; but hope for it as a gift of grace,
   and not as the wages of work, or as the product of your own energy.

   The inspired apostle Paul speaks of these people as to be confirmed
   unto the end. He expected the grace of God to preserve them personally
   to the end of their lives, or till the Lord Jesus should come. Indeed,
   he expected that the whole church of God in every place and in all time
   would be kept to the end of the dispensation, till the Lord Jesus as
   the Bridegroom should come to celebrate the wedding-feast with his
   perfected Bride. All who are in Christ will be confirmed in Him till
   that illustrious day. Has He not said, "Because I live ye shall live
   also"? He also said, "I give unto my sheep eternal life; and they shall
   never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." He that
   hath begun a good work in you will confirm it unto the day of Christ.
   The work of grace in the soul is not a superficial reformation; the
   life implanted as the new birth comes of a living and incorruptible
   seed, which liveth and abideth for ever; and the promises of God made
   to believers are not of a transient character, but involve for their
   fulfilment the believer's holding on his way till he comes to endless
   glory. We are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation.
   "The righteous shall hold on his way." Not as the result of our own
   merit or strength, but as a gift of free and undeserved favor those who
   believe are "preserved in Christ Jesus." Of the sheep of His fold Jesus
   will lose none; no member of His Body shall die; no gem of His treasure
   shall be missing in the day when He makes up His jewels. Dear reader,
   the salvation which is received by faith is not a thing of months and
   years; for our Lord Jesus hath "obtained eternal salvation for us," and
   that which is eternal cannot come to an end.

   Paul also declares his expectation that the Corinthian saints would be
   "Confirmed to the end blameless." This blamelessness is a precious part
   of our keeping. To be kept holy is better than merely to be kept safe.
   It is a dreadful thing when you see religious people blundering out of
   one dishonor into another; they have not believed in the power of our
   Lord to make them blameless. The lives of some professing Christians
   are a series of stumbles; they are never quite down, and yet they are
   seldom on their feet. This is not a fit thing for a believer; he is
   invited to walk with God, and by faith he can attain to steady
   perseverance in holiness; and he ought to do so. The Lord is able, not
   only to save us from hell, but to keep us from falling. We need not
   yield to temptation. Is it not written, "Sin shall not have dominion
   over you?" The Lord is able to keep the feet of His saints; and He will
   do it if we will trust Him to do so. We need not defile our garments,
   we may by His grace keep them unspotted from the world; we are bound to
   do this, "for without holiness no man shall see the Lord."

   The apostle prophesied for these believers, that which he would have us
   seek after--that we may be preserved, blameless unto the day of our
   Lord Jesus Christ." The revised version has "unreproveable," instead of
   "blameless." Possibly a better rendering would be "unimpeachable." God
   grant that in that last great day we may stand free from all charge,
   that none in the whole universe may dare to challenge our claim to be
   the redeemed of the Lord. We have sins and infirmities to mourn over,
   but these are not the kind of faults which would prove us to be out of
   Christ; we shall be clear of hypocrisy, deceit, hatred, and delight in
   sin; for these things would be fatal charges. Despite our failings, the
   Holy Spirit can work in us a character spotless before men; so that,
   like Daniel, we shall furnish no occasion for accusing tongues, except
   in the matter of our religion. Multitudes of godly men and women have
   exhibited lives so transparent, so consistent throughout, that none
   could gainsay them. The Lord will be able to say of many a believer, as
   he did of Job, when Satan stood before Him, "Hast thou considered my
   servant, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and
   escheweth evil?" This is what my reader must look for at the Lord's
   hands. This is the triumph of the saints--to continue to follow the
   Lamb whithersoever He goeth, maintaining our integrity as before the
   living God. May we never turn aside into crooked ways, and give cause
   to the adversary to blaspheme. Of the true believer it is written, "He
   keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not." May it be so
   written concerning us!

   Friend just beginning in the divine life, the Lord can give you an
   irreproachable character. Even though in your past life you may have
   gone far into sin, the Lord can altogether deliver you from the power
   of former habits, and make you an example of virtue. He can not only
   make you moral, but He can make you abhor every false way and follow
   after all that is saintly. Do not doubt it. The chief of sinners need
   not be a whit behind the purest of the saints. Believe for this, and
   according to your faith shall it be unto you.

   Oh, what a joy it will be to be found blameless in the day of judgment!
   We sing not amiss, when we join in that charming hymn:

     Bold shall I stand in that great day,
     For who aught to my charge shall lay;
     While through Thy blood absolved I am,
     From sin's tremendous curse and shame?

   What bliss it will be to enjoy that dauntless courage, when heaven and
   earth shall flee away from the face of the Judge of all! This bliss
   shall be the portion of everyone who looks alone to the grace of God in
   Christ Jesus, and in that sacred might wages continual war with all
   sin.

WHY SAINTS PERSEVERE

   THE HOPE which filled the heart of Paul concerning the Corinthian
   brethren we have already seen to be full of comfort to those who
   trembled as to their future. But why was it that he believed that the
   brethren would be confirmed unto the end?

   I want you to notice that he gives his reasons. Here they are:

   God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son
   Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 1:9).

   The apostle does not say, "You are faithful." Alas! the faithfulness of
   man is a very unreliable affair; it is mere vanity. He does not say,
   "You have faithful ministers to lead and guide you, and therefore I
   trust you will be safe." Oh, no! if we are kept by men we shall be but
   ill kept. He puts it, "God is faithful." If we are found faithful, it
   will be because God is faithful. On the faithfulness of our covenant
   God the whole burden of our salvation must rest. On this glorious
   attribute of God the matter hinges. We are variable as the wind, frail
   as a spider's web, weak as water. No dependence can be placed upon our
   natural qualities, or our spiritual attainments; but God abideth
   faithful. He is faithful in His love; He knows no variableness, neither
   shadow of turning. He is faithful to His purpose; He doth not begin a
   work and then leave it undone. He is faithful to His relationships; as
   a Father He will not renounce His children, as a friend He will not
   deny His people, as a Creator He will not forsake the work of His own
   hands. He is faithful to His promises, and will never allow one of them
   to fail to a single believer. He is faithful to His covenant, which He
   has made with us in Christ Jesus, and ratified with the blood of His
   sacrifice. He is faithful to His Son, and will not allow His precious
   blood to be spilled in vain. He is faithful to His people to whom He
   has promised eternal life, and from whom He will not turn away.

   This faithfulness of God is the foundation and cornerstone of our hope
   of final perseverance. The saints shall persevere in holiness, because
   God perseveres in grace. He perseveres to bless, and therefore
   believers persevere in being blessed. He continues to keep His people,
   and therefore they continue to keep His commandments. This is good
   solid ground to rest upon, and it is delightfully consistent with the
   title of this little book, "all of grace." Thus it is free favor and
   infinite mercy which ring in the dawn of salvation, and the same sweet
   bells sound melodiously through the whole day of grace.

   You see that the only reasons for hoping that we shall be confirmed to
   the end, and be found blameless at the last, are found in our God; but
   in Him these reasons are exceedingly abundant.

   They lie first, in what God has done. He has gone so far in blessing us
   that it is not possible for Him to run back. Paul reminds us that He
   has "called us into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ." Has he
   called us? Then the call cannot be reversed; for, "the gifts and
   calling of God are without repentance." From the effectual call of His
   grace the Lord never turns. "Whom he called them he also justified, and
   whom he justified them he also glorified:" this is the invariable rule
   of the divine procedure. There is a common call, of which it is said,
   "Many are called, but few are chosen," but this of which we are now
   thinking is another kind of call, which betokens special love, and
   necessitates the possession of that to which we are called. In such a
   case it is with the called one even as with Abraham's seed, of whom the
   Lord said, "I have called thee from the ends of the earth, and said
   unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee
   away."

   In what the Lord has done, we see strong reasons for our preservation
   and future glory, because the Lord has called us into the fellowship of
   His Son Jesus Christ. It means into partnership with Jesus Christ, and
   I would have you carefully consider what this means. If you are indeed
   called by divine grace, you have come into fellowship with the Lord
   Jesus Christ, so as to be joint-owner with Him in all things.
   Henceforth you are one with Him in the sight of the Most High. The Lord
   Jesus bare your sins in His own body on the tree, being made a curse
   for you; and at the same time He has become your righteousness, so that
   you are justified in Him. You are Christ's and Christ is yours. As Adam
   stood for his descendants, so does Jesus stand for all who are in Him.
   As husband and wife are one, so is Jesus one with all those who are
   united to Him by faith; one by a conjugal union which can never be
   broken. More than this, believers are members of the Body of Christ,
   and so are one with Him by a loving, living, lasting union. God has
   called us into this union, this fellowship, this partnership, and by
   this very fact He has given us the token and pledge of our being
   confirmed to the end. If we were considered apart from Christ we should
   be poor perishable units, soon dissolved and borne away to destruction;
   but as one with Jesus we are made partakers of His nature, and are
   endowed with His immortal life. Our destiny is linked with that of our
   Lord, and until He can be destroyed it is not possible that we should
   perish.

   Dwell much upon this partnership with the Son of God, unto which you
   have been called: for all your hope lies there. You can never be poor
   while Jesus is rich, since you are in one firm with Him. Want can never
   assail you, since you are joint-proprietor with Him who is Possessor of
   Heaven and earth. You can never fail; for though one of the partners in
   the firm is as poor as a church mouse, and in himself an utter
   bankrupt, who could not pay even a small amount of his heavy debts, yet
   the other partner is inconceivably, inexhaustibly rich. In such
   partnership you are raised above the depression of the times, the
   changes of the future, and the shock of the end of all things. The Lord
   has called you into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ, and by that
   act and deed He has put you into the place of infallible safeguard.

   If you are indeed a believer you are one with Jesus, and therefore you
   are secure. Do you not see that it must be so? You must be confirmed to
   the end until the day of His appearing, if you have indeed been made
   one with Jesus by the irrevocable act of God. Christ and the believing
   sinner are in the same boat: unless Jesus sinks, the believer will
   never drown. Jesus has taken His redeemed into such connection with
   himself, that He must first be smitten, overcome, and dishonored, ere
   the least of His purchased ones can be injured. His name is at the head
   of the firm, and until it can be dishonored we are secure against all
   dread of failure.

   So, then, with the utmost confidence let us go forward into the unknown
   future, linked eternally with Jesus. If the men of the world should
   cry, "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
   Beloved?" we will joyfully confess that we do lean on Jesus, and that
   we mean to lean on Him more and more. Our faithful God is an
   everflowing well of delight, and our fellowship with the Son of God is
   a full river of joy. Knowing these glorious things we cannot be
   discouraged: nay, rather we cry with the apostle, "Who shall separate
   us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord?"

   IF MY READER has not followed me step by step as he has read my pages,
   I am truly sorry. Book-reading is of small value unless the truths
   which pass before the mind are grasped, appropriated, and carried out
   to their practical issues. It is as if one saw plenty of food in a shop
   and yet remained hungry, for want of personally eating some. It is all
   in vain, dear reader, that you and I have met, unless you have actually
   laid hold upon Christ Jesus, my Lord. On my part there was a distinct
   desire to benefit you, and I have done my best to that end. It pains me
   that I have not been able to do you good, for I have longed to win that
   privilege. I was thinking of you when I wrote this page, and I laid
   down my pen and solemnly bowed my knee in prayer for everyone who
   should read it. It is my firm conviction that great numbers of readers
   will get a blessing, even though you refuse to be of the number. But
   why should you refuse? If you do not desire the choice blessing which I
   would have brought to you, at least do me the justice to admit that the
   blame of your final doom will not lie at my door. When we two meet
   before the great white throne you will not be able to charge me with
   having idly used the attention which you were pleased to give me while
   you were reading my little book. God knoweth I wrote each line for your
   eternal good. I now in spirit take you by the hand. I give you a firm
   grip. Do you feel my brotherly grasp? The tears are in my eyes as I
   look at you and say, Why will you die? Will you not give your soul a
   thought? Will you perish through sheer carelessness? Oh, do not so; but
   weigh these solemn matters, and make sure work for eternity! Do not
   refuse Jesus, His love, His blood, His salvation. Why should you do so?
   Can you do it?

   I beseech you,

   Do not turn away from your Redeemer!

   If, on the other hand, my prayers are heard, and you, my reader, have
   been led to trust the Lord Jesus and receive from Him salvation by
   grace, then keep you ever to this doctrine, and this way of living. Let
   Jesus be your all in all, and let free grace be the one line in which
   you live and move. There is no life like that of one who lives in the
   favor of God. To receive all as a free gift preserves the mind from
   self-righteous pride, and from self-accusing despair. It makes the
   heart grow warm with grateful love, and thus it creates a feeling in
   the soul which is infinitely more acceptable to God than anything that
   can possibly come of slavish fear. Those who hope to be saved by trying
   to do their best know nothing of that glowing fervor, that hallowed
   warmth, that devout joy in God, which come with salvation freely given
   according to the grace of God. The slavish spirit of self- salvation is
   no match for the joyous spirit of adoption. There is more real virtue
   in the least emotion of faith than in all the tuggings of legal
   bond-slaves, or all the weary machinery of devotees who would climb to
   Heaven by rounds of ceremonies. Faith is spiritual, and God who is a
   spirit delights in it for that reason. Years of prayer-saying, and
   church-going, or chapel- going, and ceremonies, and performances, may
   only be an abomination in the sight of Jehovah; but a glance from the
   eye of true faith is spiritual and it is therefore dear to Him. "The
   Father seeketh such to worship him." Look you first to the inner man,
   and to the spiritual, and the rest will then follow in due course.

   If you are saved yourself, be on the watch for the souls of others.
   Your own heart will not prosper unless it is filled with intense
   concern to bless your fellow men. The life of your soul lies in faith;
   its health lies in love. He who does not pine to lead others to Jesus
   has never been under the spell of love himself. Get to the work of the
   Lord--the work of love. Begin at home. Visit next your neighbors.
   Enlighten the village or the street in which you live. Scatter the word
   of the Lord wherever your hand can reach.

   Reader, meet me in heaven! Do not go down to hell. There is no coming
   back again from that abode of misery. Why do you wish to enter the way
   of death when Heaven's gate is open before you? Do not refuse the free
   pardon, the full salvation which Jesus grants to all who trust Him. Do
   not hesitate and delay. You have had enough of resolving, come to
   action. Believe in Jesus now, with full and immediate decision. Take
   with you words and come unto your Lord this day, even this day.
   Remember, O soul, it may be

   now or never

   with you. Let it be NOW; it would be horrible that it should be never.

   Again I charge you,

   meet me in heaven.
