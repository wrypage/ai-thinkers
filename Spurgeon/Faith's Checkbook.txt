                               FAITH'S CHECKBOOK

  Being Precious Promises Arranged

  For Daily Use

  With Brief Experimental Comments

    By

C. H. Spurgeon


   A promise from God may very instructively be compared to a check
   payable to order. It is given to the believer with the view of
   bestowing upon him some good thing. It is not meant that he should read
   it over comfortably, and then have done with it. No, he is to treat the
   promise as a reality, as a man treats a check.

   He is to take the promise, and endorse it with his own name by
   personally receiving it as true. He is by faith to accept it as his
   own. He sets to his seal that God is true, and true as to this
   particular word of promise. He goes further, and believes that he has
   the blessing in having the sure promise of it, and therefore he puts
   his name to it to testify to the receipt of the blessing.

   This done, he must believingly present the promise to the Lord, as a
   man presents a check at the counter of the Bank. He must plead it by
   prayer, expecting to have it fulfilled. If he has come to Heaven's bank
   at the right date, he will receive the promised amount at once. If the
   date should happen to be further on, he must patiently wait till its
   arrival; but meanwhile he may count the promise as money, for the Bank
   is sure to pay when the due time arrives.

   Some fail to place the endorsement of faith upon the check, and so they
   get nothing; and others are slack in presenting it, and these also
   receive nothing. This is not the fault of the promise, but of those who
   do not act with it in a common-sense, business-like manner.

   God has given no pledge which He will not redeem, and encouraged no
   hope which He will not fulfill. To help my brethren to believe this, I
   have prepared this little volume. The sight of the promises themselves
   is good for the eyes of faith: the more we study the words of grace,
   the more grace shall we derive from the words. To the cheering
   Scriptures I have added testimonies of my own, the fruit of trial and
   experience. I believe all the promises of God, but many of them I have
   personally tried and proved. I have seen that they are true, for they
   have been fulfilled to me. This, I trust, may be cheering to the young;
   and not without solace to the older sort. One man's experience may be
   of the utmost use to another; and this is why the man of God of old
   wrote, "I sought the Lord, and he heard me"; and again, "This poor man
   cried, and the Lord heard him."

   I commenced these daily portions when I was wading in the surf of
   controversy. Since then I have been cast into "waters to swim in,"
   which, but for God's upholding hand, would have proved waters to drown
   in. I have endured tribulation from many flails. Sharp bodily pain
   succeeded mental depression, and this was accompanied both by
   bereavement, and affliction in the person of one dear as life. The
   waters rolled in continually, wave upon wave. I do not mention this to
   exact sympathy, but simply to let the reader see that I am no dry-land
   sailor. I have traversed full many a time those oceans which are not
   Pacific: I know the roll of the billows, and the rush of the winds.
   Never were the promises of Jehovah so precious to me as at this hour.
   Some of them I never understood till now; I had not reached the date at
   which they matured, for I was not myself mature enough to perceive
   their meaning.

   How much more wonderful is the Bible to me now than it was a few months
   ago! In obeying the Lord, and bearing His reproach outside the camp, I
   have not received new promises; but the result to me is much the same
   as if I had done so, for the old ones have opened up to me with richer
   stores. Specially has the Word of the Lord to His servant Jeremiah
   sounded exceedingly sweet in mine ears. His lot it was to speak to
   those who would not hear, or hearing, would not believe. His was the
   sorrow which comes of disappointed love, and resolute loyalty; he would
   have turned his people from their errors, but he would not himself quit
   the way of the Lord. For him there were words of deep sustaining power,
   which kept his mind from failing where nature unaided must have sunk.
   These and such like golden sentences of grace I have loved more than my
   necessary food, and with them I have enriched these pages.

   Oh, that I might comfort some of my Master's servants! I have written
   out of my own heart with the view of comforting their hearts. I would
   say to them in their trials -- My brethren, God is good. He will not
   forsake you: He will bear you through. There is a promise prepared for
   your present emergencies; and if you will believe and plead it at the
   mercy-seat through Jesus Christ, you shall see the hand of the Lord
   stretched out to help you. Everything else will fail, but His word
   never will. He has been to me so faithful in countless instances that I
   must encourage you to trust Him. I should be ungrateful to God and
   unkind to you if I did not do so.

   May the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, inspire the people of the Lord with
   fresh faith! I know that, without His divine power, all that I can say
   will be of no avail; but, under His quickening influence, even the
   humblest testimony will confirm feeble knees, and strengthen weak
   hands. God is glorified when His servants trust Him implicitly. We
   cannot be too much of children with our heavenly Father. Our young ones
   ask no question about our will or our power, but having once received a
   promise from father, they rejoice in the prospect of its fulfillment,
   never doubting that it is sure as the sun. May many readers, whom I may
   never see, discover the duty and delight of such child-like trust in
   God while they are reading the little bit which I have prepared for
   each day in the year.

   For long years several thousands of God's people have read my MORNING
   BY MORNING and EVENING BY EVENING, and many of them have been good
   enough to write me, and acknowledge the benefit of such a perusal. I
   hope this little book will not interfere with those volumes. These
   daily portions are gathered from a more varied range of topics, and are
   all the more profitable because they deal with doctrine, experience,
   practice, and everything else. This is a sweetmeat of promise only, and
   it must not interfere with the fuller meals: nay, rather, I hope it
   will excite a desire for them.

   May our Lord Jesus accept this my service for His sheep and lambs, from

   His unworthy Servant,

   C.H. Spurgeon

  THE BIBLE'S FIRST PROMISE

   "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
   and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
   heel." Gen. 3:15

   This is the first promise to fallen man. It contains the whole gospel,
   and the essence of the covenant of grace. It has been in great measure
   fulfilled. The seed of the woman, even our Lord Jesus, was bruised in
   His heel, and a terrible bruising it was. How terrible will be the
   final bruising of the serpent's head! This was virtually done when
   Jesus took away sin, vanquished death, and broke the power of Satan;
   but it awaits a still fuller accomplishment at our Lord's Second
   Advent, and in the Day of Judgment. To us the promise stands as a
   prophecy that we shall be afflicted by the powers of evil in our lower
   nature, and thus bruised in our heel: but we shall triumph in Christ,
   who sets His foot on the old serpent's head. Throughout this year we
   may have to learn the first part of this promise by experience, through
   the temptations of the devil, and the unkindness of the ungodly who are
   his seed. They may so bruise us that we may limp with our sore heel;
   but let us grasp the second part of the text, and we shall not be
   dismayed. By faith let us rejoice that we shall still reign in Christ
   Jesus, the woman's seed.

   Jan. 2


   "And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly." Rom.
   16:20

   This promise follows well upon that of yesterday. We are evidently to
   be conformed to our covenant Head, not only in His being bruised in His
   heel, but in His conquest of the evil one. Even under our feet is the
   old dragon to be bruised. The Roman believers were grieved with strife
   in the church; but their God was "the God of peace," and gave them rest
   of soul. The arch-enemy tripped up the feet of the unwary, and deceived
   the hearts of the simple; but he was to get the worst of it, and to be
   trodden down by those whom he had troubled. This victory would not come
   to the people of God through their own skill or power; but God Himself
   would bruise Satan. Though it would be under their feet, yet the
   bruising would be of the Lord alone.

   Let us bravely tread upon the tempter! Not only inferior spirits, but
   the Prince of darkness himself must go down before us. In unquestioning
   confidence in God, let us look for speedy victory. "SHORTLY." Happy
   word! Shortly we shall set our foot on the old serpent! What a joy to
   crush evil! What dishonor to Satan to have his head bruised by human
   feet! Let us by faith in Jesus tread the tempter down.

   "The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it." Gen. 28:13

   No promise is of private interpretation: it belongs not to one saint,
   but to all believers. If, my brother, thou canst in faith lie down upon
   a promise, and take thy rest thereon, it is thine. Where Jacob
   "lighted," and tarried, and rested, there he took possession.
   Stretching his weary length upon the ground, with the stones of that
   place for his pillows, he little fancied that he was thus entering into
   ownership of the land; and yet so it was. He saw in his dream that
   wondrous ladder which for all true believers unites earth and heaven;
   and surely where the foot of the ladder stood he must have a right to
   the soil, for otherwise he could not reach the divine stairway. All the
   promises of God are Yea and Amen in Christ Jesus; and as He is ours,
   every promise is ours if we will but lie down upon it in restful faith.

   Come, weary one, use thy Lord's words as thy pillows. Lie down in
   peace. Dream only of Him. Jesus is thy ladder of light. See the angels
   coming and going upon Him between thy soul and thy God; and be sure
   that the promise is thine own God-given portion, and that it will not
   be robbery for thee to take it to thyself, as spoken specially to thee.

   Jan. 4


   "I will make them to lie down safely." Hos. 2:18

   Yes, the Saints are to have peace. The passage from which this gracious
   word is taken speaks of peace "with the beasts of the field, and with
   the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground." This
   is peace with earthly enemies, with mysterious evils, and with little
   annoyances! Any of these might keep us from lying down, but none of
   them shall do so. The Lord will quite destroy those things which
   threaten His people: "I will break the bow and the sword, and the
   battle out of the earth." Peace will be profound indeed when all the
   instruments of disquiet are broken to pieces.

   With this peace will come rest. "So he giveth his beloved sleep." Fully
   supplied and divinely quieted, believers lie down in calm repose.

   This rest will be a safe one. It is one thing to lie down, but quite
   another "to lie down safely." We are brought to the land of promise,
   the house of the Father, the chamber of love, and the bosom of Christ:
   surely we may now "lie down safely." It is safer for a believer to lie
   down in peace than to sit up and worry.

   "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures." We never rest till the
   Comforter makes us lie down.

   "I will strengthen thee." Isa. 41:10

   When called to serve or to suffer, we take stock of our strength, and
   we find it to be less than we thought, and less than we need. But let
   not our heart sink within us while we have such a word as this to fall
   back upon, for it guarantees us all that we can possibly need. God has
   strength omnipotent; that strength He can communicate to us; and His
   promise is that He will do so. He will be the food of our souls, and
   the health of our hearts; and thus He will give us strength. There is
   no telling how much power God can put into a man. When divine strength
   comes, human weakness is no more a hindrance.

   Do we not remember seasons of labor and trial in which we received such
   special strength that we wondered at ourselves? In the midst of danger
   we were calm, under bereavement we were resigned, in slander we were
   self-contained, and in sickness we were patient. The fact is, that God
   gives unexpected strength when unusual trials come upon us. We rise out
   of our feeble selves. Cowards play the man, foolish ones have wisdom
   given them, and the silent receive in the self-same hour what they
   shall speak. My own weakness makes me shrink, but God's promise makes
   me brave. Lord, strengthen me "according to thy word."

   Jan. 6


   "Yea, I will help thee." Isa. 41:10

   Yesterday's promise secured us strength for what we have to do, but
   this guarantees us aid in cases where we cannot act alone. The Lord
   says, "I will help thee." Strength within is supplemented by help
   without. God can raise us up allies in our warfare if so it seems good
   in His sight; and even if He does not send us human assistance, He
   himself will be at our side, and this is better still. "Our August
   Ally" is better than legions of mortal helpers.

   His help is timely: He is a very present help in time of trouble. His
   help is very wise: He knows how to give each man help meet and fit for
   him. His help is most effectual, though vain is the help of man. His
   help is more than help, for He bears all the burden, and supplies all
   the need. "The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto
   me."

   Because He has already been our help, we feel confidence in Him for the
   present and the future. Our prayer is, "Lord, be thou my helper"; our
   experience is, "The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities ; our
   expectation is, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, whence cometh
   my help"; and our song soon will be, "Thou, Lord, hast holpen me."

   Jan. 7


   "Thou shalt see greater things than these." John 1:50

   This is spoken to a childlike believer, who was ready to accept Jesus
   as the Son of God, the King of Israel, upon one convincing piece of
   argument. Those who are willing to see shall see: it is because we shut
   our eyes that we become so sadly blind.

   We have seen much already. Great things and unsearchable has the Lord
   showed unto us, for which we praise His name; but there are greater
   truths in His Word, greater depths of experience, greater heights of
   fellowship, greater works of usefulness, greater discoveries of power,
   and love, and wisdom. These we are yet to see if we are willing to
   believe our Lord. The faculty of inventing false doctrine is ruinous,
   but power to see the truth is a blessing. Heaven shall be opened to us,
   the way thither shall be made clear to us in the Son of man, and the
   angelic commerce which goes on between the upper and the lower kingdoms
   shall be made more manifest to us. Let us keep our eyes open toward
   spiritual objects, and expect to see more and more. Let us believe that
   our lives will not drivel down into nothing, but that we shall be
   always on the growing hand, seeing greater and still greater things,
   till we behold the Great God himself, and never again lose the sight of
   Him.

   Jan. 8


   "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." Matt. 5:8

   Purity, even purity of heart, is the main thing to be aimed at. We need
   to be made clean within through the Spirit and the Word, and then we
   shall be clean without by consecration and obedience. There is a close
   connection between the affections and the understanding: if we love
   evil, we cannot understand that which is good. If the heart is foul,
   the eye will be dim. How can those men see a holy God who love unholy
   things?

   What a privilege it is to see God here! A glimpse of Him is Heaven
   below! In Christ Jesus the pure in heart behold the Father. We see Him,
   His truth, His love, His purpose, His sovereignty, His covenant
   character, yea, we see Himself in Christ. But this is only apprehended
   as sin is kept out of the heart. Only those who aim at godliness can
   cry, "Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord." The desire of Moses, "I
   beseech thee, show me thy glory," can only be fulfilled in us as we
   purify ourselves from all iniquity. We shall "see him as he is"; and
   "every one that hath this hope in him purifieth himself." The enjoyment
   of present fellowship and the hope of the beatific vision are urgent
   motives for purity of heart and life. Lord, make us pure in heart, that
   we may see Thee!

   "The liberal soul shall be made fat." Prov. 11:25

   If I desire to flourish in soul, I must not hoard up my stores, but
   must distribute to the poor. To be close and niggardly is the world's
   way to prosperity, but it is not God's way, for He saith, "There is
   that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more
   than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty." Faith's way of gaining is
   giving. I must try this again and again; and I may expect that as much
   of prosperity as will be good for me will come to me as a gracious
   reward for a liberal course of action.

   Of course, I may not be sure of growing rich. I shall be fat, but not
   too fat. Too great riches might make me as unwieldy as corpulent
   persons usually are, and cause me the dyspepsia of worldliness, and
   perhaps bring on a fatty degeneration of the heart. No, if I am fat
   enough to be healthy, I may well be satisfied; and if the Lord grants
   me a competence, I may be thoroughly content.

   But there is a mental and spiritual fatness which I would greatly
   covet, and these come as the result of generous thoughts toward my God,
   His church, and my fellow-men. Let me not stint, lest I starve my
   heart. Let me be bountiful, and liberal; for so shall I be like my
   Lord. He gave Himself for me: shall I grudge Him anything?

   Jan. 10


   "He that watereth shall be watered also himself." Prov. 11:25

   If I carefully consider others, God will consider me; and in some way
   or other He will recompense me. Let me consider the poor, and the Lord
   will consider me. Let me look after little children, and the Lord will
   treat me as His child. Let me feed His flock, and He will feed me. Let
   me water His garden, and He will make a watered garden of my soul. This
   is the Lord's own promise; be it mine to fulfill the condition, and
   then to expect its fulfillment.

   I may care about myself till I grow morbid; I may watch over my own
   feelings till I feel nothing; and I may lament my own weakness till I
   grow almost too weak to lament. It will be far more profitable for me
   to become unselfish, and out of love to my Lord Jesus begin to care for
   the souls of those around me. My tank is getting very low; no fresh
   rain comes to fill it; what shall I do? I will pull up the plug, and
   let its contents run out to water the withering plants around me. What
   do I see? My cistern seems to fill as it flows. A secret spring is at
   work. While all was stagnant, the fresh spring was sealed; but as my
   stock flows out to water others the Lord thinketh upon me. Hallelujah!

   Jan. 11


   "And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that
   the bow shall be seen in the cloud." Gen. 9:14

   Just now clouds are plentiful enough, but we are not afraid that the
   world will be destroyed by a deluge. We see the rainbow often enough to
   prevent our having any such fears. The covenant which the Lord made
   with Noah stands fast, and we have no doubts about it. Why, then,
   should we think that the clouds of trouble, which now darken our sky,
   will end in our destruction? Let us dismiss such groundless and
   dishonoring fears.

   Faith always sees the bow of covenant promise whenever sense sees the
   cloud of affliction. God has a bow with which He might shoot out His
   arrows of destruction; but see! it is turned upward. It is a bow
   without an arrow or a string; it is a bow hung out for show, no longer
   used for war. It is a bow of many colors, expressing joy and delight,
   and not a bow blood-red with slaughter, or black with anger. Let us be
   of good courage. Never does God so darken our sky as to leave His
   covenant without a witness; and even if He did, we would trust Him,
   since He cannot change, or lie, or in any other way fail to keep His
   covenant of peace. Until the waters go over the earth again, we shall
   have no reason for doubting our God.

  "LOVE UNTO THE END"

   "For the Lord will not cast off for ever." Lam. 3:31

   He may cast away for a season, but not for ever. A woman may leave off
   her ornaments for a few days, but she will not forget them, nor throw
   them upon the dunghill. It is not like the Lord to cast off those whom
   He loves: for, "having loved his own which were in the world, he loved
   them unto the end." Some talk of our being in grace and out of it, as
   if we were like rabbits that run in and out of their burrows: but,
   indeed, it is not so. The Lord's love is a far more serious and abiding
   matter than this.

   He chose us from eternity, and He will love us throughout eternity. He
   loved us so as to die for us, and we may therefore be sure that His
   love will never die. His honor is so wrapped up in the salvation of the
   believer, that He can no more cast him off than He can cast off His own
   robes of office as King of glory. No, no! The Lord Jesus, as a Head,
   never casts off His members; as a Husband, He never casts off His
   bride.

   Did you think you were cast off? Why did you think so evil of the Lord
   who has betrothed you to Himself? Cast off such thoughts, and never let
   them lodge in your soul again. "The Lord hath not cast away his people
   which he foreknew" (Rom. 11:2). "He hateth putting away" (Mal. 2:16).

   Jan. 13


   "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." John 6:37

   Is there any instance of our Lord's casting out a coming one? If there
   be so, we would like to know of it; but there has been none, and there
   never will be. Among the lost souls in hell there is not one that can
   say, "I went to Jesus, and He refused me." It is not possible that you
   or I should be the first to whom Jesus shall break His word. Let us not
   entertain so dark a suspicion.

   Suppose we go to Jesus now about the evils of today. Of this we may be
   sure -- He will not refuse us audience, or cast us out. Those of us who
   have often been, and those who have never gone before -- let us go
   together, and we shall see that He will not shut the door of His grace
   in the face of any one of us.

   "This man receiveth sinners," but He repulses none. We come to Him in
   weakness and sin, with trembling faith, and small knowledge, and
   slender hope; but He does not cast us out. We come by prayer, and that
   prayer broken; with confession, and that confession faulty; with
   praise, and that praise far short of His merits; but yet He receives
   us. We come diseased, polluted, worn out, and worthless; but He doth in
   no wise cast us out. Let us come again today to Him who never casts us
   out.

   Jan. 14


   "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest." Matt. 11:28

   We who are saved find rest in Jesus. Those who are not saved will
   receive rest if they come to Him, for here He promises to "give" it.
   Nothing can be freer than a gift; let us gladly accept what He gladly
   gives. You are not to buy it, nor to borrow it; but to receive it as a
   gift. You labor under the lash of ambition, covetousness, lust, or
   anxiety: He will set you free from this iron bondage, and give you
   rest. You are "laden" -- yes, "heavy laden" with sin, fear, care,
   remorse, fear of death; but if you come to Him, He will unload you. He
   carried the crushing mass of our sin, that we might no longer carry it.
   He made Himself the great Burden-bearer, that every heavy laden one
   might cease from bowing down under the enormous pressure.

   Jesus gives rest. It is so. Will you believe it? Will you put it to the
   test? Will you do so at once? Come to Jesus, by quitting every other
   hope, by thinking of Him, believing God's testimony about Him, and
   trusting everything with Him. If you thus come to Him, the rest which
   He will give you will be deep, safe, holy, and everlasting. He gives a
   rest which develops into heaven, and He gives it this day to all who
   come to Him.

   Jan. 15


   "For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the
   poor shall not perish for ever." Ps. 9:18

   Poverty is a hard heritage; but those who trust in the Lord are made
   rich by faith. They know that they are not forgotten of God; and though
   it may seem that they are overlooked in His providential distribution
   of good things, they look for a time when all this shall be righted.
   Lazarus will not always lie among the dogs at the rich man's gate, but
   he will have his recompense in Abraham's bosom.

   Even now the Lord remembers His poor but precious sons. "I am poor and
   needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me," said one of old; and it is even
   so. The godly poor have great expectations. They expect the Lord to
   provide them all things necessary for this life and godliness; they
   expect to see all things working for their good; they expect to have
   all the closer fellowship with their Lord, who had not where to lay His
   head; they expect His Second Advent, and to share its glory. This
   expectation cannot perish, for it is laid up in Christ Jesus, who
   liveth for ever; and because He lives, it shall live also. The poor
   saint singeth many a song which the rich sinner cannot understand.
   Wherefore, let us, when we have short commons below, think of the royal
   table above.

   Jan. 16


   "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of
   the Lord shall be delivered." Joel 2:32

   Why do I not call on His name? Why do I run to this neighbor and that,
   when God is so near and will hear my faintest call? Why do I sit down,
   and devise schemes, and invent plans? Why not at once roll myself and
   my burden upon the Lord? Straightforward is the best runner -- why do I
   not run at once to the living God? In vain shall I look for deliverance
   anywhere else; but with God I shall find it; for here I have His royal
   SHALL to make it sure.

   I need not ask whether I may call on Him or not, for that word
   "Whosoever" is a very wide and comprehensive one. Whosoever means me,
   for it means anybody and everybody who calls upon God. I will therefore
   follow the leading of the text, and at once call upon the glorious Lord
   who has made so large a promise.

   My case is urgent, and I do not see how I am to be delivered; but this
   is no business of mine. He who makes the promise will find out ways and
   means of keeping it. It is mine to obey His commands; it is not mine to
   direct His counsels. I am His servant, not His solicitor. I call upon
   Him, and He will deliver me.

   Jan. 17


   "And he said, Certainly I will be with thee." Exod. 3:12

   Of course, if the Lord sent Moses on an errand, He would not let him go
   alone. The tremendous risk which it would involve, and the great power
   it would require, would render it ridiculous for God to send a poor
   lone Hebrew to confront the mightiest king in all the world, and then
   leave him to himself. It could not be imagined that a wise God would
   match poor Moses with Pharaoh and the enormous forces of Egypt. Hence
   He says, "Certainly I will be with thee," as if it were out of the
   question that He would send him alone.

   In my case, also, the same rule will hold good. If I go upon the Lord's
   errand, with a simple reliance upon His power, and a single eye to His
   glory, it is certain that He will be with me. His sending me binds Him
   to back me up. Is not this enough? What more can I want? If all the
   angels and archangels were with me, I might fail; but if HE is with me,
   I must succeed. Only let me take care that I act worthily toward this
   promise. Let me not go timidly, half-heartedly, carelessly,
   presumptuously. What manner of person ought he to be who has God with
   him! In such company it behoveth me to play the man, and like Moses go
   in unto Pharaoh without fear.

   Jan. 18


   "When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his
   seed." Isa. 53:10

   Our Lord Jesus has not died in vain. His death was sacrificial: He died
   as our substitute, because death was the penalty of our sins; and
   because His substitution was accepted of God, He has saved those for
   whom He made His soul a sacrifice. By death He became like the corn of
   wheat which bringeth forth much fruit. There must be a succession of
   children unto Jesus; He is "the Father of the everlasting age." He
   shall say, "Behold, I and the children whom thou hast given me."

   A man is honored in his sons, and Jesus hath His quiver full of these
   arrows of the mighty. A man is represented in his children, and so is
   the Christ in Christians. In his seed a man's life seems to be
   prolonged and extended; and so is the life of Jesus continued in
   believers.

   Jesus lives, for He sees His seed. He fixes His eye on us, He delights
   in us, He recognizes us as the fruit of His soul travail. Let us be
   glad that our Lord does not fail to enjoy the result of His dread
   sacrifice, and that He will never cease to feast His eyes upon the
   harvest of His death. Those eyes which once wept for us, are now
   viewing us with pleasure. Yes, He looks upon those who are looking unto
   Him. Our eyes meet! What a joy is this!

   Jan. 19

  MOUTH CONFESSION; HEART BELIEF

   "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
   in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
   saved." Rom. 10:9

   There must be confession with the mouth. Have I made it? Have I openly
   avowed my faith in Jesus as the Saviour whom God has raised from the
   dead, and have I done it in God's way? Let me honestly answer this
   question.

   There must also be belief with the heart. Do I sincerely believe in the
   risen Lord Jesus? Do I trust in Him as my sole hope of salvation? Is
   this trust from my heart? Let me answer as before God.

   If I can truly claim that I have both confessed Christ and believed in
   Him, then I am saved. The text does not say it may be so, but it is
   plain as a pikestaff, and clear as the sun in the Heavens: "Thou shalt
   be saved." As a believer and a confessor, I may lay my hand on this
   promise, and plead it before the Lord God at this moment, and
   throughout life, and in the hour of death, and at the day of judgment.

   I must be saved from the guilt of sin, the power of sin, the punishment
   of sin, and ultimately from the very being of sin. God hath said it --
   "Thou shalt be saved." I believe it. I shall be saved: I am saved.
   Glory be to God for ever and ever!

   Jan. 20


   "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which
   is in the midst of the paradise of God." Rev. 2:7

   No man may turn his back in the day of battle, or refuse to go to the
   holy war. We must fight if we would reign, and we must carry on the
   warfare till we overcome every enemy, or else this promise is not for
   us, since it is only for "him that overcometh." We are to overcome the
   false prophets who have come into the world, and all the evils which
   accompany their teaching. We are to overcome our own faintness of
   heart, and tendency to decline from our first love. Read the whole of
   the Spirit's word to the church at Ephesus.

   If by grace we win the day, as we shall if we truly follow our
   conquering Leader, then we shall be admitted to the very center of the
   paradise of God, and shall be permitted to pass by the cherub and his
   flaming sword, and come to that guarded tree, whereof if a man eat, he
   shall live for ever. We shall thus escape that endless death which is
   the doom of sin, and gain that everlasting life which is the seal of
   innocence, the outgrowth of immortal principles of God-like holiness.
   Come, my heart, pluck up courage! To flee the conflict will be to lose
   the joys of the new and better Eden; to fight unto victory is to walk
   with God in Paradise.

   Jan. 21

  GOD'S ENEMIES SHALL BOW

   "The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord." Exod. 7:5

   The ungodly world is hard to teach. Egypt does not know Jehovah, and
   therefore dares to set up its idols, and even ventures to ask -- "Who
   is the Lord?" Yet the Lord means to break proud hearts, whether they
   will or not. When His judgments thunder over their heads, darken their
   skies, destroy their harvests, and slay their sons, they begin to
   discern somewhat of Jehovah's power. There will yet be such things done
   in the earth as shall bring skeptics to their knees. Let us not be
   dismayed because of their blasphemies, for the Lord can take care of
   His own name, and He will do so in a very effectual manner.

   The salvation of His own people was another potent means of making
   Egypt know that the God of Israel was Jehovah, the living and true God.
   No Israelite died by any one of the ten plagues. None of the chosen
   seed were drowned in the Red Sea. Even so, the salvation of the elect,
   and the sure glorification of all true believers, will make the most
   obstinate of God's enemies acknowledge that Jehovah He is the God.

   Oh, that His convincing power would go forth by His Holy Spirit in the
   preaching of the gospel, till all nations shall bow at the name of
   Jesus, and call Him Lord!

   "Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in
   time of trouble." Ps. 41:1

   To think about the poor and let them lie on our hearts is a Christian
   man's duty; for Jesus put them with us and near us when He said, "The
   poor ye have always with you."

   Many give their money to the poor in a hurry, without thought; and many
   more give nothing at all. This precious promise belongs to those who
   "consider" the poor, look into their case, devise plans for their
   benefit, and considerately carry them out. We can do more by care than
   by cash, and most with the two together. To those who consider the
   poor, the Lord promises His own consideration in times of distress. He
   will bring us out of trouble if we help others when they are in
   trouble. We shall receive very singular providential help if the Lord
   sees that we try to provide for others. We shall have a time of
   trouble, however generous we may be; but if we are charitable, we may
   put in a claim for peculiar deliverance, and the Lord will not deny His
   own word and bond. Miserly curmudgeons may help themselves, but
   considerate and generous believers the Lord will help. As you have done
   unto others, so will the Lord do unto you. Empty your pockets.

   "And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
   shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him." Lev. 1:4

   If by that laying on of his hand the bullock became the offerer's
   sacrifice, how much more shall Jesus become ours by the laying on of
   the hand of faith?


   "My faith doth lay her hand

   On that dear head of Thine,

   While like a penitent I stand,

   And there confess my sin."

   If a bullock could be accepted for him to make atonement for him, how
   much more shall the Lord Jesus be our full and all-sufficient
   propitiation? Some quarrel with the great truth of substitution; but as
   for us, it is our hope, our joy, our boast, our all. Jesus is accepted
   for us to make atonement for us, and we are "accepted in the Beloved."

   Let the reader take care at once to lay his hand on the Lord's
   completed sacrifice, that by accepting it he may obtain the benefit of
   it. If he has done so once, let him do it again. If he has never done
   so, let him put out his hand without a moment's delay. Jesus is yours
   now if you will have Him. Lean on Him; lean hard on Him; and He is
   yours beyond all question; you are reconciled to God, your sins are
   blotted out, and you are the Lord's.

   Jan. 24


   "He will keep the feet of his saints." I Sam. 2:9

   The way is slippery, and our feet are feeble, but the Lord will keep
   our feet. If we give ourselves up by obedient faith to be His holy
   ones, He will Himself be our guardian. Not only will He charge His
   angels to keep us, but He Himself will preserve our goings.

   He will keep our feet from falling, so that we do not defile our
   garments, wound our souls, and cause the enemy to blaspheme.

   He will keep our feet from wandering, so that we do not go into paths
   of error, or ways of folly, or courses of the world's custom.

   He will keep our feet from swelling through weariness, or blistering
   because of the roughness and length of the way.

   He will keep our feet from wounding: our shoes shall be iron and brass,
   so that even though we tread on the edge of the sword, or on deadly
   serpents, we shall not bleed, or be poisoned.

   He will also pluck our feet out of the net. We shall not be entangled
   by the deceit of our malicious and crafty foes.

   With such a promise as this, let us run without weariness, and walk
   without fear. He who keeps our feet will do it effectually.

   Jan. 25


   "He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that
   which was right, and it profited me not; he will deliver his soul from
   going into the pit, and his life shall see the light." Job 33:27, 28

   This is a word of truth, gathered from the experience of a man of God,
   and it is tantamount to a promise. What the Lord has done, and is
   doing, He will continue to do while the world standeth. The Lord will
   receive into His bosom all who come to Him with a sincere confession of
   their sin; in fact, He is always on the look-out to discover any that
   are in trouble because of their faults.

   Can we not endorse the language here used? Have we not sinned, sinned
   personally so as to say, "I have sinned"? Sinned willfully, having
   perverted that which is right? Sinned so as to discover that there is
   no profit in it, but an eternal loss? Let us, then, go to God with this
   honest acknowledgment. He asks no more. We can do no less.

   Let us plead His promise in the name of Jesus. He will deliver us from
   the pit of hell which yawns for us; He will grant us life and light.
   Why should we despair? Why should we even doubt? The Lord does not mock
   humble souls. He means what He says. The guilty can be forgiven. Those
   who deserve execution can receive free pardon. Lord, we confess, and we
   pray thee to forgive!

   Jan. 26


   "Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any
   divination against Israel." Num. 23:23

   How this should cut up root and branch all silly, superstitious fears!
   Even if there were any truth in witchcraft and omens, they could not
   affect the people of the Lord. Those whom God blesses, devils cannot
   curse.

   Ungodly men, like Balaam, may cunningly plot the overthrow of the
   Lord's Israel; but with all their secrecy and policy they are doomed to
   fail. Their powder is damp, the edge of their sword is blunted. They
   gather together; but as the Lord is not with them, they gather together
   in vain. We may sit still, and let them weave their nets, for we shall
   not be taken in them. Though they call in the aid of Beelzebub, and
   employ all his serpentine craft, it will avail them nothing: the spells
   will not work, the divination will deceive them. What a blessing this
   is! How it quiets the heart! God's Jacobs wrestle with God, but none
   shall wrestle with them and prevail. God's Israels have power with God
   and prevail, but none shall have power to prevail against them. We need
   not fear the fiend himself, nor any of those secret enemies whose words
   are full of deceit and whose plans are deep and unfathomable. They
   cannot hurt those who trust in the living God. We defy the devil and
   all his legions.

   Jan. 27


   "And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye
   have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for
   all your evils that ye have committed." Ezek. 20:43

   When we are accepted of the Lord, and are standing in the place of
   favor, and peace, and safety, then we are led to repent of all our
   failures and miscarriages toward our gracious God. So precious is
   repentance, that we may call it a diamond of the first water, and this
   is sweetly promised to the people of God as one most sanctifying result
   of salvation. He who accepts repentance, also gives repentance; and He
   gives it not out of "the bitter box," but from among those "wafers made
   with honey" on which He feeds His people. A sense of blood-bought
   pardon and of undeserved mercy, is the best means of dissolving a heart
   of stone. Are we feeling hard? Let us think of covenant love, and then
   we shall leave sin, lament sin, and loathe sin; yea, we shall loathe
   ourselves for sinning against such infinite love. Let us come to God
   with this promise of penitence, and ask Him to help us to remember, and
   repent, and regret, and return. Oh, that we could enjoy the meltings of
   holy sorrow! What a relief would a flood of tears be! Lord, smite the
   rock, or speak to the rock, and cause the waters to flow!

   Jan. 28


   "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." Rev. 21:4

   Yes, we shall come to this if we are believers. Sorrow shall cease, and
   tears shall be wiped away. This is the world of weeping, but it passes
   away. There shall be a new Heaven, and a new earth, so says the first
   verse of this chapter; and therefore there will be nothing to weep over
   concerning the fall and its consequent miseries. Read the second verse,
   and note how it speaks of the bride and her marriage. The Lamb's
   wedding is a time for boundless pleasure, and tears would be out of
   place. The third verse says that God Himself will dwell among men; and
   surely at His right hand there are pleasures for evermore, and tears
   can no longer flow.

   What will our state be when there will be no more sorrow, nor crying,
   neither shall there be any more pain? This will be more glorious than
   we can as yet imagine. O eyes that are red with weeping, cease your
   scalding flow, for in a little while ye shall know no more tears! None
   can wipe tears away like the God of love, but He is coming to do it.
   "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning." Come,
   Lord, and tarry not; for now both men and women must weep!

   Jan. 29


   "Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go
   well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou
   doest that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God."
   Deut. 12:28

   Though salvation is not by the works of the law, yet the blessings
   which are promised to obedience are not denied to the faithful servants
   of God. The curses our Lord took away, when He was made a curse for us,
   but no clause of blessing has been abrogated.

   We are to note and listen to the revealed will of the Lord, giving our
   attention not to portions of it, but to "all these words." There must
   be no picking and choosing, but an impartial respect to all that God
   has commanded. This is the road of blessedness for the father and for
   his children. The Lord's blessing is upon His chosen to the third and
   fourth generation. If they walk uprightly before Him, He will make all
   men know that they are a seed which the Lord has blessed.

   No blessing can come to us or ours through dishonesty or double
   dealing. The ways of worldly conformity and unholiness cannot bring
   good to us or ours. It will go well with us when we go well before God.
   If integrity does not make us prosper, knavery will not. That which
   gives pleasure to God will bring pleasure to us.

   Jan. 30


   "And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither
   thou goest." Gen. 28:15

   Do we need journeying mercies? Here are choice ones -- God's presence
   and preservation. In all places we need both of these, and in all
   places we shall have them if we go at the call of duty, and not merely
   according to our own fancy. Why should we look upon removal to another
   country as a sorrowful necessity when it is laid upon us by the divine
   will? In all lands the believer is equally a pilgrim and a stranger;
   and yet in every region the Lord is His dwellingplace, even as He has
   been to His saints in all generations. We may miss the protection of an
   earthly monarch, but when God says, "I will keep thee," we are in no
   real danger. This is a blessed passport for a traveler, and a heavenly
   escort for an emigrant.

   Jacob had never left his father's room before: he had been a mother's
   boy, and not an adventurer like his brother. Yet he went abroad, and
   God went with him. He had little luggage, and no attendants; yet no
   prince ever journeyed with a nobler bodyguard. Even while he slept in
   the open field, angels watched over him, and the Lord God spoke to him.
   If the Lord bids us go, let us say with our Lord Jesus, "Arise, let us
   go hence."

   Jan. 31


   "My God will hear me." Micah 7:7

   Friends may be unfaithful, but the Lord will not turn away from the
   gracious soul; on the contrary, He will hear all its desires. The
   prophet says, "Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy
   bosom. A man's enemies are the men of his own house." This is a
   wretched state of affairs; but even in such a case the Best Friend
   remains true, and we may tell Him all our grief.

   Our wisdom is to look unto the Lord, and not to quarrel with men or
   women. If our loving appeals are disregarded by our own relatives, let
   us wait upon the God of our salvation, for He will hear us. He will
   hear us all the more because of the unkindness and oppression of
   others, and we shall soon have reason to cry, "Rejoice not against me,
   O mine enemy!"

   Because God is the living God, He can hear; because He is a loving God,
   He will hear; because He is our covenant God, He has bound Himself to
   hear us. If we can each one speak of Him as "My God," we may with
   absolute certainty say, My God will hear me." Come, then, O bleeding
   heart, and let thy sorrows tell themselves out to the Lord thy God! I
   will bow the knee in secret, and inwardly whisper, "My God will hear
   me."

   "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
   with healing in his wings" Mal. 4:2

   Fulfilled once in the first advent of our glorious Lord, and yet to
   have a fuller accomplishment in His second advent, this gracious word
   is also for daily use. Is it dark with the reader? Does the night
   deepen into a denser blackness? Still let us not despair: the sun will
   yet rise. When the night is darkest, dawn is nearest.

   The sun which will arise is of no common sort. It is THE sun -- the Sun
   of Righteousness, whose every ray is holiness. He who comes to cheer
   us, comes in the way of justice as well as of mercy, comes to violate
   no law even to save us. Jesus as much displays the holiness of God as
   His love. Our deliverance, when it comes, will be safe because
   righteous.

   Our one point of inquiry should be -- "Do we fear the name of the Lord?
   Do we reverence the living God, and walk in His ways?" Then for us the
   night must be short; and when the morning cometh, all the sickness and
   sorrow of our soul will be over for ever. Light, warmth, joy, and
   clearness of vision will come, and healing of every disease and
   distress will follow after.

   Has Jesus risen upon us? Let us sit in the sun. Has He hidden His face?
   Let us wait for His rising. He will shine forth as surely as the sun.

   Feb. 2


   "And ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall" Mal. 4:2

   Yes, when the sun shines, the sick quit their chambers, and walk abroad
   to breathe the fresh air. When the sun brings spring and summer, the
   cattle quit their stalls, and seek pasture on the higher Alps. Even
   thus, when we have conscious fellowship with our Lord, we leave the
   stall of despondency, and walk abroad in the fields of holy confidence.
   We ascend to the mountains of joy, and feed on sweet pasturage which
   grows nearer Heaven than the provender of carnal men.

   To "go forth" and to "grow up" is a double promise. O my soul, be thou
   eager to enjoy both blessings! Why shouldst thou be a prisoner? Arise,
   and walk at liberty. Jesus saith that His sheep shall go in and out and
   find pasture; go forth, then, and feed in the rich meadows of boundless
   love.

   Why remain a babe in grace? Grow up. Young calves grow fast, especially
   if they are stall-fed; and thou hast the choice care of thy Redeemer.
   Grow, then, in grace, and in the knowledge of thy Lord and Saviour. Be
   neither straitened nor stunted. The Sun of Righteousness has risen upon
   thee. Answer to His beams, as the buds to the natural sun. Open thine
   heart, expand and grow up into Him in all things.

   Feb. 3


   "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" Rom. 8:32

   If this is not a promise in form, it is in fact. Indeed, it is more
   than one promise, it is a conglomerate of promises. It is a mass of
   rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds, with a nugget of gold for their
   setting. It is a question which can never be answered so as to cause us
   any anxiety of heart. What can the Lord deny us after giving us Jesus?
   If we need all things in Heaven and earth, He will grant them to us:
   for if there had been a limit anywhere, He would have kept back His own
   Son.

   What do I want today? I have only to ask for it. I may seek earnestly,
   but not as if I had to use pressure, and extort an unwilling gift from
   the Lord's hand; for He will give freely. Of His own will, He gave us
   His own Son. Certainly no one would have proposed such a gift to Him.
   No one would have ventured to ask for it. It would have been too
   presumptuous. He freely gave His Only-begotten; and, O my soul, canst
   thou not trust thy heavenly Father to give thee anything, to give thee
   everything? Thy poor prayer would have no force with Omnipotence if
   force were needed; but His love, like a spring, rises of itself, and
   overflows for the supply of all thy needs.

   Feb. 4


   "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" John 14:18

   He left us, and yet we are not left orphans. He is our comfort, and He
   is gone; but we are not comfortless. Our comfort is that He will come
   to us, and this is consolation enough to sustain us through His
   prolonged absence. Jesus is already on His way: He says, "I come
   quickly": He rides post-haste toward us. He says, "I will come": and
   none can prevent His coming, or put it back for a quarter of an hour.
   He specially says, "I will come to you"; and so He will. His coming is
   specially to and for His own people. This is meant to be their present
   comfort while they mourn that the Bridegroom doth not yet appear.

   When we lose the joyful sense of His presence we mourn; but we may not
   sorrow as if there were no hope. Our Lord in a little wrath has hid
   Himself from us for a moment; but He will return in full favor. He
   leaves us in a sense, but only in a sense. When He withdraws, He leaves
   a pledge behind that He will return. O Lord, come quickly! There is no
   life in this earthly existence if thou be gone. We sigh for the return
   of thy sweet smile. When wilt thou come unto us? We are sure thou wilt
   appear; but be thou like a roe, or a young hart. Make no tarrying, O
   our God!

   Feb. 5


   "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" Exod. 12:13

   My own sight of the precious blood is for my comfort; but it is the
   Lord's sight of it which secures my safety. Even when I am unable to
   behold it, the Lord looks at it, and passes over me because of it. If I
   am not so much at ease as I ought to be, because my faith is dim, yet I
   am equally safe, because the Lord's eye is not dim, and He sees the
   blood of the great Sacrifice with steady gaze. What a joy is this!

   The Lord sees the deep inner meaning, the infinite fullness of all that
   is meant by the death of His dear Son. He sees it with restful memory
   of justice satisfied, and all His matchless attributes glorified. He
   beheld creation in its progress, and said, "It is very good"; but what
   does He say of redemption in its completeness? What does He say of the
   obedience even unto death of His Well-beloved Son? None can tell His
   delight in Jesus, His rest in the sweet savor which Jesus presented
   when He offered Himself without spot unto God.

   Now rest we in calm security. We have God's Sacrifice and God's Word to
   create in us a sense of perfect security. He will, He must, pass over
   us, because He spared not our glorious Substitute. Justice joins hands
   with love to provide everlasting salvation for all the
   blood-besprinkled ones.

   Feb. 6


   "If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, blessed
   shalt thou be in the city" Deut. 28:2, 3

   The city is full of care, and he who has to go there from day to day
   finds it to be a place of great wear and tear. It is full of noise, and
   stir, and bustle, and sore travail: many are its temptations, losses,
   and worries. But to go there with the divine blessing takes off the
   edge of its difficulty; to remain there with that blessing is to find
   pleasure in its duties, and strength equal to its demands.

   A blessing in the city may not make us great, but it will keep us good;
   it may not make us rich, but it will preserve us honest. Whether we are
   porters, or clerks, or managers, or merchants, or magistrates, the city
   will afford us opportunities for usefulness. It is good fishing where
   there are shoals of fish, and it is hopeful to work for our Lord amid
   the thronging crowds. We might prefer the quiet of a country life; but
   if called to town, we may certainly prefer it because there is room for
   our energies.

   Today let us expect good things because of this promise, and let our
   care be to have an open ear to the voice of the Lord, and a ready hand
   to execute His bidding. Obedience brings the blessing. "In keeping his
   commandments there is great reward."

   Feb. 7


   "If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up" Job 22:23

   Eliphaz, in this utterance, spoke a great truth, which is the summary
   of many an inspired Scripture. Reader, has sin pulled you down? Have
   you become like a ruin? Has the hand of the Lord gone out against you,
   so that in estate you are impoverished, and in Spirit you are broken
   down? Was it your own folly which brought upon you all this
   dilapidation? Then the first thing to be done is to return to the Lord.
   With deep repentance and sincere faith find your way back from your
   backsliding. It is your duty, for you have turned away from Him whom
   you professed to serve. It is your wisdom, for you cannot strive
   against Him and prosper. It is your immediate necessity, for what He
   has done is nothing compared to what He may do in the way of
   chastisement, since He is Almighty to punish.

   See what a promise invites you! You shall be "built up." None but the
   Almighty can set up the fallen pillars, and restore the tottering walls
   of your condition; but He can and He will do it if you return to Him.
   Do not delay. Your crushed mind may quite fail you if you go on to
   rebel; but hearty confession will ease you, and humble faith will
   console you. Do this, and all will be well.

   Feb. 8


   "I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness" Isa. 41:10

   Fear of falling is wholesome. To be venturesome is no sign of wisdom.
   Times come to us when we feel that we must go down unless we have a
   very special support. Here we have it. God's right hand is a grand
   thing to lean upon. Mind, it is not only His hand, though it keepeth
   Heaven and earth in their places, but His right hand: His power united
   with skill, His power where it is most dexterous. Nay, this is not all,
   it is written, "I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
   righteousness." That hand which He uses to maintain His holiness, and
   to execute His royal sentences -- this shall be stretched out to hold
   up His trusting ones. Fearful is our danger, but joyful is our
   security. The man whom God upholds, devils cannot throw down.

   Weak may be our feet, but almighty is God's right hand. Rough may be
   the road, but Omnipotence is our upholding. We may boldly go forward.
   We shall not fall. Let us lean continually where all things lean. God
   will not withdraw His strength, for His righteousness is there as well:
   He will be faithful to His promise, and faithful to His Son, and
   therefore faithful to us. How happy we ought to be! Are we not so?

   Feb. 9


   "And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them
   as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall
   call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and
   they shall say, The Lord is my God" Zech. 13:9

   Grace transmutes us into precious metal, and then the fire and the
   furnace follow as a necessary consequence. Do we start at this? Would
   we sooner be accounted worthless, that we might enjoy repose, like the
   stones of the field? This would be to choose the viler part: like Esau,
   to take the pottage, and give up the covenant portion. No, Lord; we
   will gladly be cast into the furnace rather than be cast out from thy
   presence!

   The fire only refines, it does not destroy. We are to be brought
   through the fire, not left in it. The Lord values His people as silver,
   and therefore He is at pains to purge away their dross. If we are wise,
   we shall rather welcome the refining process than decline it. Our
   prayer will be that our alloy may be taken from us rather than that we
   should be withdrawn from the crucible.

   O Lord, thou triest us indeed! We are ready to melt under the
   fierceness of the flame. Still, this is thy way, and thy way is the
   best. Sustain us under the trial and complete the process of our
   purifying, and we will be thine for ever and ever.

   Feb. 10


   "For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and
   heard" Acts 22:15

   Paul was chosen to see and hear the Lord speaking to him out of Heaven.
   This divine election was a high privilege for himself; but it was not
   intended to end with him, it was meant to have an influence upon
   others; yea, upon all men. It is to Paul that Europe owes the gospel at
   this hour.

   It is ours in our measure to be witnesses of that which the Lord has
   revealed to us, and it is at our peril that we hide the precious
   revelation. First, we must see and hear, or we shall have nothing to
   tell; but when we have done so, we must be eager to bear our testimony.
   It must be personal: "Thou shalt be." It must be for Christ: "Thou
   shalt be his witness." It must be constant and all absorbing; we are to
   be this above all other things, and to the exclusion of many other
   matters. Our witness must not be to a select few who will cheerfully
   receive us; but to all men" -- to all whom we can reach, young or old,
   rich or poor, good or bad. We must never be silent like those who are
   possessed by a dumb spirit; for the text before us is a command, and a
   promise, and we must not miss it -- "Thou shalt be his witness." "Ye
   are my witnesses, saith the Lord."

   Lord, fulfill this word to me also!

   Feb. 11

  ARE THE CHILDREN IN?

   "I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
   offspring" Isa. 44:3

   Our dear children have not the Spirit of God by nature, as we plainly
   see. We see much in them which makes us fear as to their future, and
   this drives us to agonizing prayer. When a son becomes specially
   perverse, we cry with Abraham, "Oh, that Ishmael might live before
   thee!" We would sooner see our daughters Hannahs than empresses. This
   verse should greatly encourage us. It follows upon the words, "Fear
   not, O Jacob, my servant," and it may well banish our fears.

   The Lord will give His Spirit; will give it plentifully, pouring it
   out; will give it effectually, so that it shall be a real and eternal
   blessing. Under this divine outpouring our children shall come forward,
   and "one shall say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself by
   the name of Jacob."

   This is one of those promises concerning which the Lord will be
   inquired of. Should we not, at set times, in a distinct manner, pray
   for our offspring? We cannot give them new hearts, but the Holy Spirit
   can; and He is easily to be entreated of. The great Father takes
   pleasure in the prayers of fathers and mothers. Have we any dear ones
   outside of the ark? Let us not rest till they are shut in with us by
   the Lord's own hand.

   "And the Lord said unto Abraham, after that Lot was separated from him,
   Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
   northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land
   which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever"
   Gen. 13:14, 15

   A special blessing for a memorable occasion. Abram had settled a family
   dispute. He had said, "Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between
   thee and me, for we be brethren"; and hence he received the blessing
   which belongs to peacemakers. The Lord and giver of peace delights to
   manifest His grace to those who seek peace and pursue it. If we desire
   closer communion with God, we must keep closer to the ways of peace.

   Abram had behaved very generously to his kinsman, giving him his choice
   of the land. If we deny ourselves for peace' sake, the Lord will more
   than make it up to us. As far as the patriarch can see, he can claim,
   and we may do the like by faith. Abram had to wait for the actual
   possession, but the Lord entailed the land upon him and his posterity.
   Boundless blessings belong to us by covenant gift. All things are ours.
   When we please the Lord, He makes us to look everywhere, and see all
   things our own, whether things present, or things to come, all are
   ours, and we are Christ's, and Christ is God's.

   "Blessed shalt thou be in the field" Deut. 28:3

   So was Isaac blessed when he walked therein at eventide to meditate.
   How often has the Lord met us when we have been alone! The hedges and
   the trees can bear witness to our joy. We look for such blessedness
   again.

   So was Boaz blessed when he reaped his harvest, and his workmen met him
   with benedictions. May the Lord prosper all who drive the plough! Every
   farmer may urge this promise with God, if indeed he obeys the voice of
   the Lord God.

   We go to the field to labor as father Adam did; and since the curse
   fell on the soil through the sin of Adam the first, it is a great
   comfort to find a blessing through Adam the second.

   We go to the field for exercise, and we are happy in the belief that
   the Lord will bless that exercise, and give us health, which we will
   use to His glory.

   We go to the field to study nature, and there is nothing in a knowledge
   of the visible creation which may not be sanctified to the highest uses
   by the divine benediction.

   We have at last to go to the field to bury our dead; yea, others will
   in their turn take us to God's acre in the field: but we are blessed,
   whether weeping at the tomb, or sleeping in it.

   "He that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about" Ps. 32:10

   O fair reward of trust! My Lord, grant it me to the full! The truster
   above all men feels himself to be a sinner; and lo, mercy is prepared
   for him: he knows himself to have no deservings, but mercy comes in,
   and keeps house for him on a liberal scale. O Lord, give me this mercy,
   even as I trust in thee!

   Observe, my soul, what a bodyguard thou hast! As a prince is compassed
   about with soldiery, so art thou compassed about with mercy. Before and
   behind, and on all sides, ride these mounted guards of grace. We dwell
   in the center of the system of mercy, for we dwell in Christ Jesus.

   O my soul, what an atmosphere dost thou breathe! As the air surrounds
   thee, even so does the mercy of thy Lord. To the wicked there are many
   sorrows, but to thee there are so many mercies that thy sorrows are not
   worth mentioning. David says, "Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye
   righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart." In
   obedience to this precept my heart shall triumph in God, and I will
   tell out my gladness. As thou hast compassed me with mercy, I will also
   compass thine altars, O my God, with songs of thanksgiving!

   "The Lord hath been mindful of us: he will bless us" Ps. 115:12

   I can set my seal to that first sentence. Cannot you? Yes, Jehovah has
   thought of us, provided for us, comforted us, delivered us, and guided
   us. In all the movements of His providence He has been mindful of us,
   never overlooking our mean affairs. His mind has been full of us --
   that is the other form of the word "mindful." This has been the case
   all along, and without a single break. At special times, however, we
   have more distinctly seen this mindfulness, and we would recall them at
   this hour with overflowing gratitude. Yes, yes, "the Lord hath been
   mindful of us."

   The next sentence is a logical inference from the former one. Since God
   is unchangeable, He will continue to be mindful of us in the future as
   He has been in the past; and His mindfulness is tantamount to blessing
   us. But we have here, not only the conclusion of reason but the
   declaration of inspiration: we have it on the Holy Ghost's authority --
   "HE WILL BLESS US." This means great things and unsearchable. The very
   indistinctness of the promise indicates its infinite reach. He will
   bless us after His own divine manner, and that for ever and ever.
   Therefore, let us each say, "Bless the Lord, O my soul!"

   "I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to
   destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man" Hos. 11:9

   The Lord thus makes known His sparing mercies. It may be that the
   reader is now under heavy displeasure, and everything threatens his
   speedy doom. Let the text hold him up from despair. The Lord now
   invites you to consider your ways, and confess your sins. If He had
   been man, He would long ago have cut you off. If He were now to act
   after the manner of men, it would be a word and a blow and then there
   would be an end of you: but it is not so, for "as high as the heavens
   are above the earth, so high are his ways above your ways."

   You rightly judge that He is angry, but He keepeth not His anger for
   ever: if you turn from sin to Jesus, God will turn from wrath. Because
   God is God, and not man, there is still forgiveness for you, even
   though you may be steeped up to your throat in iniquity. You have a God
   to deal with, and not a hard man, nor even a merely just man. No human
   being could have patience with you: you would have wearied out an
   angel, as you have wearied your sorrowing father; but God is
   longsuffering. Come and try Him at once. Confess, believe, and turn
   from your evil way, and you shall be saved.

   "Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work
   shall be rewarded" II Chron. 15:7

   God had done great things for King Asa and Judah, but yet they were a
   feeble folk. Their feet were very tottering in the ways of the Lord,
   and their hearts very hesitating, so that they had to be warned that
   the Lord would be with them while they were with Him, but that if they
   forsook Him He would leave them. They were also reminded of the sister
   kingdom, how ill it fared in its rebellion, and how the Lord was
   gracious to it when repentance was shown. The Lord's design was to
   confirm them in His way, and make them strong in righteousness. So
   ought it to be with us. God deserves to be served with all the energy
   of which we are capable.

   If the service of God is worth anything, it is worth everything. We
   shall find our best reward in the Lord's work if we do it with
   determined diligence. Our labor is not in vain in the Lord, and we know
   it. Half-hearted work will bring no reward; but, when we throw our
   whole soul into the cause, we shall see prosperity. This text was sent
   to the author of these notes in a day of terrible storm, and it
   suggested to him to put on all steam, with the assurance of reaching
   port in safety with a glorious freight.

   "He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear
   their cry, and will save them" Ps. 145:19

   His own Spirit has wrought this desire in us, and therefore He will
   answer it. It is His own life within which prompts the cry, and
   therefore He will hear it. Those who fear Him are men under the holiest
   influence, and, therefore, their desire is to glorify God, and enjoy
   Him for ever. Like Daniel, they are men of desires, and the Lord will
   cause them to realize their aspirations.

   Holy desires are grace in the blade, and the heavenly Husbandman will
   cultivate them till they come to the full corn in the ear. God-fearing
   men desire to be holy, to be useful, to be a blessing to others, and so
   to honor their Lord. They desire supplies for their need, help under
   burdens, guidance in perplexity, deliverance in distress; and sometimes
   this desire is so strong, and their case so pressing, that they cry out
   in agony, like little children in pain, and then the Lord works most
   comprehensively, and does all that is needful, according to this Word
   -- "and will save them."

   Yes, if we fear God, we have nothing else to fear; if we cry to the
   Lord, our salvation is certain.

   Let the reader lay this text on his tongue, and keep it in his mouth
   all the day, and it will be to him as "a wafer made with honey."

   "Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more" Nah. 1:12

   There is a limit to affliction. God sends it and God removes it. Do you
   sigh, and say "When will the end be?" Remember that our griefs will
   surely and finally end when this poor earthly life is over. Let us
   quietly wait, and patiently endure the will of the Lord till He cometh.

   Meanwhile, our Father in Heaven takes away the rod when His design in
   using it is fully served. When He has whipped away our folly, there
   will be no more strokes. Or, if the affliction is sent for testing us,
   that our graces may glorify God, it will end when the Lord has made us
   bear witness to His praise. We would not wish the affliction to depart
   till God has gotten out of us all the honor which we can possibly yield
   Him.

   There may today be "a great calm." Who knows how soon those raging
   billows will give place to a sea of glass, and the sea birds sit on the
   gentle waves? After long tribulation the flail is hung up, and the
   wheat rests in the garner. We may, before many hours are past, be just
   as happy as now we are sorrowful. It is not hard for the Lord to turn
   night into day. He that sends the clouds can as easily clear the skies.
   Let us be of good cheer. It is better on before. Let us sing Hallelujah
   by anticipation.

   Feb. 20


   "The Lord shall guide thee continually" Isa. 58:11

   What aileth thee? Hast thou lost thy way? Art thou entangled in a dark
   wood, and canst thou not find thy paths? Stand still, and see the
   salvation of God. He knows the way, and He will direct thee in it if
   thou cry unto Him.

   Every day brings its own perplexity. How sweet to feel that the
   guidance of the Lord is continual! If we choose our own way, or consult
   with flesh and blood, we cast off the Lord's guidance; but if we
   abstain from self-will, then He will direct every step of our road,
   every hour of the day, and every day of the year, and every year of our
   life. If we will but be guided, we shall be guided. If we will commit
   our way unto the Lord, He will direct our course so that we shall not
   lose ourselves.

   But note to whom this promise is made. Read the previous verse: "If
   thou draw out thy soul to the hungry." We must feel for others, and
   give them, not a few dry crusts, but such things as we ourselves would
   wish to receive. If we show a tender care for our fellow-creatures in
   the hour of their need, then will the Lord attend to our necessities,
   and make Himself our continual Guide. Jesus is the Leader, not of
   misers, nor of those who oppress the poor, but of the kind and
   tender-hearted. Such persons are pilgrims, who shall never miss their
   way.

   "He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great" Ps.
   115:13

   This is a word of cheer to those who are of humble station and mean
   estate. Our God has a very gracious consideration for those of small
   property, small talent, small influence, small weight. God careth for
   the small things in creation, and even regards sparrows in their
   lighting upon the ground. Nothing is small to God, for He makes use of
   insignificant agents for the accomplishment of His purposes. Let the
   least among men seek of God a blessing upon his littleness, and he
   shall find his contracted sphere to be a happy one.

   Among those who fear the Lord there are little and great. Some are
   babes, and others are giants. But these are all blessed. Little faith
   is blessed faith. Trembling hope is blessed hope. Every grace of the
   Holy Spirit, even though it be only in the bud, bears a blessing within
   it. Moreover, the Lord Jesus bought both the small and the great with
   the same precious blood, and He has engaged to preserve the lambs as
   well as the full-grown sheep. No mother overlooks her child because it
   is little; nay, the smaller it is, the more tenderly does she nurse it.
   If there be any preference with the Lord, He does not arrange them as
   "great and small," but as "small and great.

   "David said moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the
   lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the
   hand of this Philistine" I Sam. 17:37

   This is not a promise if we consider only the words, but it is truly so
   as to its sense; for David spoke a word which the Lord endorsed by
   making it true. He argued from past deliverances that he should receive
   help in a new danger. In Jesus all the promises are Yea and Amen to the
   glory of God by us, and so the Lord's former dealings with His
   believing people will be repeated.

   Come, then, let us recall the Lord's former lovingkindnesses. We could
   not have hoped to be delivered aforetime by our own strength; yet the
   Lord delivered us. Will He not again save us? We are sure He will. As
   David ran to meet his foe, so will we. The Lord has been with us, He is
   with us, and He has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
   Why do we tremble? Was the past a dream? Think of the dead bear and
   lion. Who is this Philistine? True, he is not quite the same, and is
   neither bear nor lion; but then God is the same, and His honor is as
   much concerned in the one case as in the other. He did not save us from
   the beasts of the forest to let a giant kill us. Let us be of good
   courage.

   Feb. 23


   "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
   will, and it shall be done unto you" John 15:7

   Of necessity we must be in Christ to live unto Him, and we must abide
   in Him to be able to claim the largesse of this promise from Him. To
   abide in Jesus is never to quit Him for another love, or another
   object, but to remain in living, loving, conscious, willing union with
   Him. The branch is not only ever near the stem, but ever receiving life
   and fruitfulness from it. All true believers abide in Christ in a
   sense; but there is a higher meaning, and this we must know before we
   can gain unlimited power at the throne. "Ask what ye will" is for
   Enochs who walk with God, for Johns who lie in the Lord's bosom, for
   those whose union with Christ leads to constant communion.

   The heart must remain in love, the mind must be rooted in faith, the
   hope must be cemented to the Word, the whole man must be joined unto
   the Lord, or else it would be dangerous to trust us with power in
   prayer. The carte blanche can only be given to one whose very life is,
   "Not I, but Christ liveth in me." O you who break your fellowship, what
   power you lose! If you would be mighty in your pleadings, the Lord
   Himself must abide in you, and you in Him.

   Feb. 24


   "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
   will, and it shall be done unto you" John 15:7

   Note well, that we must hear Jesus speak if we expect Him to hear us
   speak. If we have no ear for Christ, He will have no ear for us. In
   proportion as we hear we shall be heard.

   Moreover, what is heard must remain, must live in us, and must abide in
   our character as a force and a power. We must receive the truths which
   Jesus taught, the precepts which He issued, and the movements of His
   Spirit within us; or we shall have no power at the mercy-seat.

   Suppose our Lord's words to be received, and to abide in us, what a
   boundless field of privilege is opened up to us! We are to have our
   will in prayer, because we have already surrendered our will to the
   Lord's command. Thus are Elijahs trained to handle the keys of Heaven,
   and lock or loose the clouds. One such man is worth a thousand common
   Christians. Do we humbly desire to be intercessors for the church and
   the world, and like Luther to be able to have what we will of the Lord?
   Then we must bow our ear to the voice of the Well-beloved, and treasure
   up His words, and carefully obey them. He had need to "hearken
   diligently" who would pray effectually.

   Feb. 25


   "Ye shall be named the priests of the Lord" Isa. 61:6

   This literal promise to Israel belongs spiritually to the seed after
   the Spirit, namely, to all believers. If we live up to our privileges,
   we shall live unto God so clearly and distinctly, that men shall see
   that we are set apart for holy service, and shall name us the priests
   of the Lord. We may work, or trade, as others do, and yet we may be
   solely and wholly the ministering servants of God. Our one occupation
   shall be to present the perpetual sacrifice of prayer, and praise, and
   testimony, and self-consecration, to the living God by Jesus Christ.

   This being our one aim, we may leave distracting concerns to those who
   have no higher calling. "Let the dead bury their dead." It is written,
   "Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien
   shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers." They may manage
   politics, puzzle out financial problems, discuss science, and settle
   the last new quibbles of criticism; but we will give ourselves unto
   such service as becomes those who, like the Lord Jesus, are ordained to
   a perpetual priesthood.

   Accepting this honorable promise as involving a sacred duty, let us put
   on the vestments of holiness, and minister before the Lord all day
   long.

   Feb. 26


   "The lip of truth shall be established for ever; but a lying tongue is
   but for a moment" Prov. 12:19

   Truth wears well. Time tests it, but it right well endures the trial.
   If, then, I have spoken the truth, and have for the present to suffer
   for it, I must be content to wait. If also I believe the truth of God,
   and endeavor to declare it, I may meet with much opposition, but I need
   not fear, for ultimately the truth must prevail.

   What a poor thing is the temporary triumph of falsehood! "A lying lip
   is but for a moment!" It is a mere gourd, which comes up in a night,
   and perishes in a night; and the greater its development the more
   manifest its decay. On the other hand, how worthy of an immortal being
   is the avowal and defense of that truth which can never change; the
   everlasting gospel, which is established in the immutable truth of an
   unchanging God! An old proverb saith, "He that speaks truth shames the
   devil." Assuredly he that speaks the truth of God will put to shame all
   the devils in hell, and confound all the seed of the serpent which now
   hiss out their falsehoods.

   O my heart, take care that thou be in all things on the side of truth,
   both in small things and great; but specially, on the side of Him by
   whom grace and truth have come among men!

   Feb. 27


   "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting
   in the Lord" Ps. 112:7

   Suspense is dreadful. When we have no news from home, we are apt to
   grow anxious, and we cannot be persuaded that "no news is good news."
   Faith is the cure for this condition of sadness: the Lord by His Spirit
   settles the mind in holy serenity, and all fear is gone as to the
   future as well as the present.

   The fixedness of heart spoken of by the Psalmist is to be diligently
   sought after. It is not believing this or that promise of the Lord, but
   the general condition of unstaggering trustfulness in our God, the
   confidence which we have in Him that He will neither do us ill Himself,
   nor suffer anyone else to harm us. This constant confidence meets the
   unknown as well as the known of life. Let the morrow be what it may,
   our God is the God of tomorrow. Whatever events may have happened,
   which to us are unknown, our Jehovah is God of the unknown as well as
   of the known. We are determined to trust the Lord, come what may. If
   the very worst should happen, our God is still the greatest and best.
   Therefore will we not fear though the postman's knock should startle
   us, or a telegram wake us at midnight. The Lord liveth, and what can
   His children fear?

   Feb. 28


   "Knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring
   substance" Heb. 10:34

   This is well. Our substance here is very insubstantial; there is no
   substance in it. But God has given us a promise of real estate in the
   glory-land, and that promise comes to our hearts with such full
   assurance of its certainty, that we know in ourselves that we have an
   enduring substance there. Yes, "we have" it even now. They say, "A bird
   in the hand is worth two in the bush"; but we have our bird in the bush
   and in the hand too. Heaven is even now our own. We have the title-deed
   of it, we have the earnest of it, we have the first fruits of it. We
   have Heaven in price, in promise, and in principle: this we know not
   only by the hearing of the ear, but "in ourselves."

   Should not the thought of the better substance on the other side of
   Jordan reconcile us to present losses? Our spending-money we may lose,
   but our treasure is safe. We have lost the shadows, but the substance
   remains, for our Saviour lives, and the place which He has prepared for
   us abides. There is a better land, a better substance, a better
   promise; and all this comes to us by a better covenant; wherefore, let
   us be in better spirits, and say unto the Lord, "Every day will I bless
   thee; and praise thy name for ever and ever."

   Feb. 29


   "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life" Ps.
   23:6

   A devout poet sings-


   "Lord, when thou

   Puttest in my time a day, as thou dost now,

   Unknown in other years, grant, I entreat,

   Such grace illume it, that whate'er its phase

   It add to holiness, and lengthen praise!"

   This day comes but once in four years, Oh, that we could win a fourfold
   blessing upon it! Up till now goodness and mercy, like two guards, have
   followed us from day to day, bringing up the rear even as grace leads
   the van; and as this out-of-the-way day is one of the days of our life,
   the two guardian angels will be with us today also. Goodness to supply
   our needs, and mercy to blot out our sins -- these twain shall attend
   our every step this day, and every day till days shall be no more.
   Wherefore, let us serve the Lord on this peculiar day with special
   consecration of heart, and sing His praises with more zest and
   sweetness than ever. Could we not today make an unusual offering to the
   cause of God, or to the poor? By inventiveness of love let us make this
   twenty-ninth of February a day to be remembered forever.

  JOY FOR THE CAST-OUT

   "Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren
   that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the
   Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be
   ashamed" Isa. 66:5

   Possibly this text may not apply to one in a thousand of the readers of
   this little book of promises; but the Lord cheers that one in such
   words as these. Let us pray for all such as are cast out wrongfully
   from the society which they love. May the Lord appear to their joy!

   The text applies to truly gracious men who tremble at the word of the
   Lord. These were hated of their brethren, and at length cast out
   because of their fidelity and their holiness. This must have been very
   bitter to them; and all the more so because their casting out was done
   in the name of religion, and professedly with the view of glorifying
   God. How much is done for the devil in the name of God! The use of the
   name of Jehovah to add venom to the bite of the old serpent is an
   instance of his subtlety.

   The appearing of the Lord for them is the hope of His persecuted
   people. He appears as the advocate and defender of His elect; and when
   He does so, it means a clear deliverance for the God-fearing and shame
   for their oppressors. O Lord, fulfill this word to those whom men are
   deriding!

   "But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right
   hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which
   seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly" Matt. 6:3,4

   No promise is made to those who give to the poor to be seen of men.
   They have their reward at once, and cannot expect to be paid twice.

   Let us hide away our charity; -- yes, hide it even from ourselves. Give
   so often and so much as a matter of course, that you no more take note
   that you have helped the poor than that you have eaten your regular
   meals. Do your alms without even whispering to yourself, "How generous
   I am!" Do not thus attempt to reward yourself. Leave the matter with
   God, who never fails to see, to record, and to reward. Blessed is the
   man who is busy in secret with his kindness: he finds a special joy in
   his unknown benevolences. This is the bread, which eaten by stealth, is
   sweeter than the banquets of kings. How can I indulge myself today with
   this delightful luxury? Let me have a real feast of tenderness and flow
   of soul.

   Here and hereafter the Lord, Himself, will personally see to the
   rewarding of the secret giver of alms. This will be in His own way and
   time; and He will choose the very best. How much this promise means it
   will need eternity to reveal.

   March 3


   "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer
   thine Holy One to see corruption" Ps. 16:10

   This word has its proper fulfillment in the Lord Jesus; but it applies
   also, with a variation, to all who are in Him. Our soul shall not be
   left in the separate state, and our body, though it see corruption,
   shall rise again. The general meaning, rather than the specific
   application, is that to which we would call our readers' thoughts at
   this particular time.

   We may descend in spirit very low till we seem to be plunged in the
   abyss of hell; but we shall not be left there. We may appear to be at
   death's door in heart, and soul, and consciousness; but we cannot
   remain there. Our inward death as to joy and hope may proceed very far;
   but it cannot run on to its full consequences, so as to reach the utter
   corruption of black despair. We may go very low, but not lower than the
   Lord permits; we may stay in the lowest dungeon of doubt for a while,
   but we shall not perish there. The star of hope is still in the sky
   when the night is blackest. The Lord will not forget us and hand us
   over to the enemy. Let us rest in hope. We have to deal with One whose
   mercy endureth for ever. Surely, out of death, and darkness, and
   despair we shall yet arise to life, light, and liberty.

   "Them that honor me I will honor" I Sam. 2:30

   Do I make the honor of God the great object of my life and the rule of
   my conduct? If so, He will honor me. I may for a while receive no honor
   from man, but God will Himself put honor upon me in the most effectual
   manner. In the end it will be found the surest way to honor to be
   willing to be put to shame for conscience' sake.

   Eli had not honored the Lord by ruling his household well, and his sons
   had not honored the Lord by behavior worthy of their sacred office, and
   therefore the Lord did not honor them, but took the high-priesthood out
   of their family, and made young Samuel to be ruler in the land instead
   of any of their line. If I would have my family ennobled, I must honor
   the Lord in all things. God may allow the wicked to win worldly honors;
   but the dignity which He Himself gives, even glory, honor, and
   immortality, He reserves for those who by holy obedience take care to
   honor Him.

   What can I do this day to honor the Lord? I will promote His glory by
   my spoken testimony, and by my practical obedience. I will also honor
   Him with my substance, and by offering to Him some special service. Let
   me sit down and think how I can honor Him, since He will honor me.

   "He blesseth the habitation of the just" Prov. 3:33

   He fears the Lord, and therefore he comes under the divine protection
   even as to the roof which covers himself and his family. His home is an
   abode of love, a school of holy training, and a place of heavenly
   light. In it there is a family altar where the name of the Lord is
   daily had in reverence. Therefore the Lord blesses his habitation. It
   may be a humble cottage or a lordly mansion; but the Lord's blessing
   comes because of the character of the inhabitant, and not because of
   the size of the dwelling.

   That house is most blest in which the master and mistress are
   God-fearing people; but a son or daughter or even a servant may bring a
   blessing on a whole household. The Lord often preserves, prospers, and
   provides for a family for the sake of one or two in it, who are just
   persons in His esteem, because His grace has made them so. Beloved, let
   us have Jesus for our constant guest even as the sisters of Bethany
   had, and then we shall be blessed indeed.

   Let us look to it that in all things we are just -- in our trade, in
   our judgment of others, in our treatment of neighbors, and in our own
   personal character. A just God cannot bless unjust transactions.

   "In thee the fatherless findeth mercy" Hos. 14:3

   This is an excellent reason for casting away all other confidences and
   relying upon the Lord alone. When a child is left without its natural
   protector, our God steps in and becomes his guardian: so also when a
   man has lost every object of dependence, he may cast himself upon the
   living God and find in Him all that he needs. Orphans are cast upon the
   fatherhood of God, and He provides for them. The writer of these pages
   knows what it is to hang on the bare arm of God, and he bears his
   willing witness that no trust is so well warranted by facts, or so sure
   to be rewarded by results, as trust in the invisible but ever living
   God.

   Some children who have fathers are not much the better off because of
   them, but the fatherless with God are rich. Better have God and no
   other friend than all the patrons on the earth and no God. To be
   bereaved of the creature is painful, but so long as the Lord remains
   the fountain of mercy to us, we are not truly orphaned. Let fatherless
   children plead the gracious word for this morning, and let all who have
   been bereaved of visible support do the same. Lord, let me find mercy
   in thee! The more needy and helpless I am, the more confidently do I
   appeal to thy loving heart.

   "The Lord looseth the prisoners" Ps. 146:7

   He has done it. Remember Joseph, Israel in Egypt, Manasseh, Jeremiah,
   Peter, and many others. He can do it still. He breaks the bars of brass
   with a word, and snaps the fetters of iron with a look. He is doing it.
   In a thousand places troubled ones are coming forth to light and
   enlargement. Jesus still proclaims the opening of the prison to them
   that are bound. At this moment doors are flying back and fetters are
   dropping to the ground.

   He will delight to set you free, dear friend, if at this time you are
   mourning because of sorrow, doubt, and fear. It will be a joy to Jesus
   to give you liberty. It will give Him as great a pleasure to loose you
   as it will be a pleasure to you to be loosed. No, you have not to snap
   the iron band: the Lord Himself will do it. Only trust Him, and He will
   be your Emancipator. Believe in Him in spite of the stone walls, or the
   manacles of iron. Satan cannot hold you, sin cannot enchain you, even
   despair cannot bind you, if you will now believe in the Lord Jesus, and
   in the freeness of His grace, and the fullness of His power to save.

   Defy the enemy, and let the word now before you be your song of
   deliverance: "Jehovah looseth the prisoners."

   "Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store" Deut. 28:5

   Obedience brings a blessing on all the provisions which our industry
   earns for us. That which comes in and goes out at once, like fruit in
   the basket which is for immediate use, shall be blest; and that which
   is laid by with us for a longer season shall equally receive a
   blessing. Perhaps ours is a handbasket portion. We have a little for
   breakfast, and a scanty bite for dinner in a basket when we go out to
   do our work in the morning. This is well, for the blessing of God is
   promised to the basket. If we live from hand to mouth, getting each
   day's supply in the day, we are as well off as Israel; for when the
   Lord entertained His favored people He only gave them a day's manna at
   a time. What more did they need? What more do we need?

   But if we have a store, how much we need the Lord to bless it! For
   there is the care of getting, the care of keeping, the care of
   managing, the care of using; and, unless the Lord bless it, these cares
   will eat into our hearts, till our goods become our gods, and our cares
   prove cankers.

   O Lord, bless our substance. Enable us to use it for thy glory. Help us
   to keep worldly things in their proper places, and never may our
   savings endanger the saving of our souls.

   March 9


   "And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried
   away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof
   shall ye have peace" Jer. 29:7

   The principle involved in this text would suggest to all of us who are
   the Lord's strangers and foreigners that we should be desirous to
   promote the peace and prosperity of the people among whom we dwell.
   Specially should our nation and our city be blest by our constant
   intercession. An earnest prayer for your country and other countries is
   well becoming in the mouth of every believer.

   Eagerly let us pray for the great boon of peace, both at home and
   abroad. If strife should cause bloodshed in our streets, or if foreign
   battle should slay our brave soldiers, we should all bewail the
   calamity; let us therefore pray for peace, and diligently promote those
   principles by which the classes at home and the races abroad may be
   bound together in bonds of amity.

   We ourselves are promised quiet in connection with the peace of the
   nation, and this most desirable; for thus we can bring up our families
   in the fear of the Lord, and also preach the gospel without let or
   hindrance. Today let us be much in prayer for our country, confessing
   national sins, and asking for national pardon and blessing, for Jesus'
   sake.

   March 10


   "I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
   should not abide in darkness" John 12:46

   This world is dark as midnight; Jesus has come that by faith we may
   have light, and may no longer sit in the gloom which covers all the
   rest of mankind.

   Whosoever is a very wide term: it means you and me. If we trust in
   Jesus we shall no more sit in the dark shadow of death, but shall enter
   into the warm light of a day which shall never end. Why do we not come
   out into the light at once?

   A cloud may sometimes hover over us, but we shall not abide in darkness
   if we believe in Jesus. He has come to give us broad daylight. Shall He
   come in vain? If we have faith we have the privilege of sunlight: let
   us enjoy it. From the night of natural depravity, of ignorance, of
   doubt, of despair, of sin, of dread, Jesus has come to set us free; and
   all believers shall know that He no more comes in vain than the sun
   rises and fails to scatter his heat and light.

   Shake off thy depression, dear brother. Abide not in the dark, but
   abide in the light. In Jesus is thy hope, thy joy, thy Heaven. Look to
   Him, to Him only, and thou shalt rejoice as the birds rejoice at
   sunrise, and as the angels rejoice before the throne.

   March 11

  WHOSE BATTLE?

   "And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword
   and spear: for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our
   hands" I Sam. 17:47

   Let this point be settled, that the battle is the Lord's, and we may be
   quite sure of the victory, and of the victory in such a way as will
   best of all display the power of God. The Lord is too much forgotten by
   all men, yea, even by the assemblies of Israel; and when there is an
   opportunity to make men see that the Great First Cause can achieve His
   purposes without the power of man, it is a priceless occasion which
   should be well employed. Even Israel looks too much to sword and spear.
   It is a grand thing to have no sword in the hand of David, and yet for
   David to know that his God will overthrow a whole army of aliens.

   If we are indeed contending for truth and righteousness, let us not
   tarry till we have talent, or wealth, or any other form of visible
   power at our disposal; but with such stones as we find in the brook,
   and with our own usual sling, let us run to meet the enemy. If it were
   our own battle we might not be confident; but if we are standing up for
   Jesus, and warring in His strength alone, who can withstand us? Without
   a trace of hesitancy let us face the Philistines; for the Lord of Hosts
   is with us, and who can be against us?

   March 12


   "And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out" Deut.
   33:18

   The blessings of the tribes are ours; for we are the true Israel who
   worship God in the spirit, and have no confidence in the flesh. Zebulun
   is to rejoice because Jehovah will bless his "going out"; we also see a
   promise for ourselves lying latent in this benediction. When we go out
   we will look out for occasions of joy.

   We go out to travel, and the providence of God is our convoy. We go out
   to emigrate, and the Lord is with us both on land and sea. We go out as
   missionaries, and Jesus saith, "Lo, I am with you unto the end of the
   world." We go out day by day to our labor, and we may do so with
   pleasure, for God will be with us from morn till eve.

   A fear sometimes creeps over us when starting, for we know not what we
   may meet with; but this blessing may serve us right well as a word of
   good cheer. As we pack up for moving, let us put this verse into our
   traveling trunk; let us drop it into our hearts, and keep it there;
   yea, let us lay it on our tongue to make us sing. Let us weigh anchor
   with a song, or jump into the carriage with a psalm. Let us belong to
   the rejoicing tribe, and in our every movement praise the Lord with
   joyful hearts.

   March 13


   "Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.
   But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to
   all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt
   speak" Jer. 1:6, 7

   Jeremiah was young and felt a natural shrinking when sent upon a great
   errand by the Lord; but He who sent him would not have him say, "I am a
   child." What he was in himself must not be mentioned, but lost in the
   consideration that he was chosen to speak for God. He had not to think
   out and invent a message, nor to choose an audience: he was to speak
   what God commanded, and speak where God sent him, and this he would be
   enabled to do in strength not his own.

   Is it not so with some young preacher, or teacher who may read these
   lines? God knows how young you are, and how slender are your knowledge
   and experience; but if He chooses to send you, it is not for you to
   shrink from the heavenly call. God will magnify Himself in your
   feebleness. If you were as old as Methuselah, how much would your years
   help you? If you were as wise as Solomon, you might be equally as
   willful as he. Keep you to your message and it will be your wisdom;
   follow your marching orders and they will be your discretion.

   March 14


   "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you" Isa. 66:13

   A mother's comfort! Ah, this is tenderness itself. How she enters into
   her child's grief! How she presses him to her bosom, and tries to take
   all his sorrow into her own heart! He can tell her all, and she will
   sympathize as nobody else can. Of all comforters the child loves best
   his mother, and even full-grown men have found it so.

   Does Jehovah condescend to act the mother's part? This is goodness
   indeed. We readily perceive how He is a father; but will He be as a
   mother also? Does not this invite us to holy familiarity, to unreserved
   confidence, to sacred rest? When God Himself becomes "the Comforter" no
   anguish can long abide. Let us tell out our trouble, even though sobs
   and sighs should become our readiest utterance. He will not despise us
   for our tears; our mother did not. He will consider our weakness as she
   did, and He will put away our faults, only in a surer, safer way than
   our mother could do. We will not try to bear our grief alone: that
   would be unkind to one so gentle and so kind. Let us begin the day with
   our loving God, and wherefore should we not finish it in the same
   company, since mothers weary not of their children?

   March 15


   "Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; Although I have cast them far
   off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the
   countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries
   where they shall come" Ezek. 11:16

   Banished from the public means of grace, we are not removed from the
   grace of the means. The Lord who places His people where they feel as
   exiles will Himself be with them, and be to them all that they could
   have had at home, in the place of their solemn assemblies. Take this to
   yourselves, O ye who are called to wander!

   God is to His people a place of refuge. They find sanctuary with Him
   from every adversary. He is their place of worship too. He is with them
   as with Jacob when he slept in the open field, and rising, said,
   "Surely God was in this place." To them also He will be a sanctuary of
   quiet, like the Holy of Holies, which was the noiseless abode of the
   Eternal. They shall be quiet from fear of evil.

   God Himself, in Christ Jesus, is the sanctuary of mercy. The ark of the
   covenant is the Lord Jesus, and Aaron's rod, the pot of manna, the
   tables of the law, all are in Christ our sanctuary. In God we find the
   shrine of holiness and of communion. What more do we need? O Lord,
   fulfill this promise and be ever to us as a little sanctuary!

   March 16

  TO OTHERS AN "ENSAMPLE"

   "Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and
   seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you" Phil. 4:9

   It is well when a man can with advantage be so minutely copied as Paul
   might have been. Oh, for grace to imitate him this day and every day!

   Should we, through divine grace, carry into practice the Pauline
   teaching, we may claim the promise which is now open before us; and
   what a promise it is! God, who loves peace, makes peace, and breathes
   peace, will be with us. "Peace be with you" is a sweet benediction; but
   for the God of peace to be with us is far more. Thus we have the
   fountain as well as the streams, the sun as well as his beams. If the
   God of peace be with us, we shall enjoy the peace of God which passeth
   all understanding, even though outward circumstances should threaten to
   disturb. If men quarrel, we shall be sure to be peacemakers, if the
   Maker of peace be with us.

   It is in the way of truth that real peace is found. If we quit the
   faith or leave the path of righteousness under the notion of promoting
   peace, we shall be greatly mistaken. First pure, then peaceable, is the
   order of wisdom and of fact. Let us keep to Paul's line, and we shall
   have the God of peace with us as He was with the apostle.

   March 17


   "Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,
   saith the Lord" Jer. 1:8

   Whenever fear comes in and makes us falter, we are in danger of falling
   into sin. Conceit is to be dreaded, but so is cowardice. "Dare to be a
   Daniel." Our great Captain should be served by brave soldiers.

   What a reason for bravery is here! God is with those who are with Him.
   God will never be away when the hour of struggle comes. Do they
   threaten you? Who are you that you should be afraid of a man that shall
   die? Will you lose your situation? Your God whom you serve will find
   bread and water for His servants. Can you not trust Him? Do they pour
   ridicule upon you? Will this break your bones or your heart? Bear it
   for Christ's sake, and even rejoice because of it.

   God is with the true, the just, the holy, to deliver them; and He will
   deliver you. Remember how Daniel came out of the lions' den, and the
   three holy children out of the furnace. Yours is not so desperate a
   case as theirs; but if it were, the Lord would bear you through, and
   make you more than a conqueror. Fear to fear. Be afraid to be afraid.
   Your worst enemy is within your own bosom. Get to your knees and cry
   for help, and then rise up saying, "I will trust, and not be afraid."

   March 18


   "The prayer of the upright is his delight" Prov. 15:8

   This is as good as a promise, for it declares a present fact, which
   will be the same throughout all ages. God takes great pleasure in the
   prayers of upright men; He even calls them His delight. Our first
   concern is to be upright. Neither bending this way nor that, continue
   upright: not crooked with policy, nor prostrate by yielding to evil, be
   you upright in strict integrity and straightforwardness. If we begin to
   shuffle and shift, we shall be left to shift for ourselves. If we try
   crooked ways, we shall find that we cannot pray, and if we pretend to
   do so, we shall find our prayers shut out of Heaven.

   Are we acting in a straight line and thus following out the Lord's
   revealed will? Then let us pray much and pray in faith. If our prayer
   is God's delight, let us not stint Him in that which gives Him
   pleasure. He does not consider the grammar of it, nor the metaphysics
   of it, nor the rhetoric of it; in all these men might despise it. He,
   as a Father, takes pleasure in the lispings of His own babes, the
   stammerings of His new-born sons and daughters. Should we not delight
   in prayer since the Lord delights in it? Let us make errands to the
   throne. The Lord finds us enough reasons for prayer, and we ought to
   thank Him that it is so.

   March 19


   "The Lord will give grace and glory" Ps. 84:11

   Grace is what we need just now, and it is to be had freely. What can be
   freer than a gift? Today we shall receive sustaining, strengthening,
   sanctifying, satisfying grace. He has given daily grace until now, and
   as for the future, that grace is still sufficient. If we have but
   little grace the fault must lie in ourselves; for the Lord is not
   straitened, neither is He slow to bestow it in abundance. We may ask
   for as much as we will and never fear a refusal. He giveth liberally
   and upbraideth not.

   The Lord may not give gold, but He will give grace: He may not give
   gain, but He will give grace. He will certainly send us trial, but He
   will give grace in proportion thereto. We may be called to labor, and
   to suffer, but with the call there will come all the grace required.

   What an AND is that in the text -- "and glory!" We do not need glory
   yet, and we are not yet fit for it; but we shall have it in due order.
   After we have eaten the bread of grace, we shall drink the wine of
   glory. We must go through the holy --which is grace, to the holiest of
   all -- which is glory. These words "and glory" are enough to make a man
   dance for joy. A little while -- a little while, and then glory
   forever!

   March 20


   "Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is,
   and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
   O ye of little faith." Matt. 6:30

   Clothes are expensive, and poor believers may be led into anxiety as to
   where their next suit will come from. The soles are thin; how shall we
   get new shoes? See how our thoughtful Lord has provided against this
   care. Our heavenly Father clothes the grass of the field with a
   splendor such as Solomon could not equal: will He not clothe His own
   children? We are sure He will. There may be many a patch and a darn,
   but raiment we shall have.

   A poor minister found his clothes nearly threadbare, and so far gone
   that they would hardly hold together; but as a servant of the Lord he
   expected his Master to find him his livery. It so happened that the
   writer on a visit to a friend had the loan of the good man's pulpit,
   and it came into his mind to make a collection for him, and there was
   his suit. Many other cases we have seen in which those who have served
   the Lord have found Him considerate of their wardrobe. He who made man
   so that when he had sinned he needed garments, also in mercy supplied
   him with them; and those which the Lord gave to our first parents were
   far better than those they made for themselves.

   March 21


   "Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
   stumble" Prov. 3:23

   That is to say, if we follow the ways of wisdom and holiness we shall
   be preserved in them. He who travels by daylight along the highway is
   under some protection. There is a way for every man, namely, his own
   proper calling in life, and if we devoutly walk therein in the fear of
   God He will preserve US from evil. We may not travel luxuriously, but
   we shall walk safely. We may not be able to run like young men, but we
   shall be able to walk like good men.

   Our greatest danger lies in ourselves: our feeble foot is so sadly apt
   to stumble. Let us ask for more moral strength that our tendency to
   slip may be overcome. Some stumble because they do not see the stone in
   the way: divine grace enables us to perceive sin, and so to avoid it.
   Let us plead this promise, and trust in Him who upholds His chosen.

   Alas! our worst peril is our own carelessness, but against this the
   Lord Jesus has put us on our guard, saying, "Watch and pray."

   Oh for grace to walk this day without a single stumble! It is not
   enough that we do not actually fall; our cry should be that we may not
   make the smallest slip with our feet, but may at the last adore Him
   "who is able to keep us from stumbling."

   March 22


   "He giveth grace unto the humble" James 4:6

   Humble hearts seek grace, and therefore they get it. Humble hearts
   yield to the sweet influences of grace, and so it is bestowed on them
   more and more largely. Humble hearts lie in the valleys where streams
   of grace are flowing, and hence they drink of them. Humble hearts are
   grateful for grace and give the Lord the glory of it, and hence it is
   consistent with His honor to give it to them.

   Come, dear reader, take a lowly place. Be little in thine own esteem,
   that the Lord may make much of thee. Perhaps the sigh breaks out, "I
   fear I am not humble." It may be that this is the language of true
   humility. Some are proud of being humble, and this is one of the very
   worst sorts of pride. We are needy, helpless, undeserving,
   hell-deserving creatures, and if we are not humble we ought to be. Let
   us humble ourselves because of our sins against humility, and then the
   Lord will give us to taste of His favor. It is grace which makes us
   humble, and grace which finds in this humility an opportunity for
   pouring in more grace. Let us go down that we may rise. Let us be poor
   in spirit that God may make us rich. Let us be humble that we may not
   need to be humbled, but may be exalted by the grace of God.

   March 23


   "I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not" Isa. 42:16

   Think of the infinitely glorious Jehovah acting as a Guide to the
   blind! What boundless condescension does this imply! A blind man cannot
   find a way which he does not know. Even when he knows the road, it is
   hard for him to traverse it; but a road which he has not known is quite
   out of the question for his unguided feet. Now, we are by nature blind
   as to the way of salvation, and yet the Lord leads us into it, and
   brings us to Himself, and then opens our eyes. As to the future, we are
   all of us blind, and cannot see an hour before us; but the Lord Jesus
   will lead us even to our journey's end. Blessed be His name!

   We cannot guess in which way deliverance can possibly come to us, but
   the Lord knows, and He will lead us till we shall have escaped every
   danger. Happy are those who place their hand in that of the great
   Guide, and leave their way and themselves entirely with Him. He will
   bring them all the way; and when He has brought them home to glory and
   has opened their eyes to see the way by which He has led them, what a
   song of gratitude will they sing unto their great Benefactor! Lord,
   lead thy poor blind child this day, for I know not my way!

   March 24


   "But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from
   evil" II Thess. 3:3

   Men are often as devoid of reason as of faith. There are with us still
   "unreasonable and wicked men." There is no use in arguing with them or
   trying to be at peace with them: they are false at heart, and deceitful
   in speech. Well, what of this? Shall we worry ourselves with them? No;
   let us turn to the Lord, for He is faithful. No promise from His Word
   will ever be broken. He is neither unreasonable in His demands upon us,
   nor unfaithful to our claims upon Him. We have a faithful God. Be this
   our joy.

   He will stablish us so that wicked men shall not cause our downfall,
   and He will keep us so that none of the evils which now assail us shall
   really do us damage. What a blessing for us that we need not contend
   with men, but are allowed to shelter ourselves in the Lord Jesus, who
   is in truest sympathy with us. There is one true heart, one faithful
   mind, one never changing Love; there let us repose. The Lord will
   fulfill the purpose of His grace to us, His servants, and we need not
   allow a shadow of a fear to fall upon our spirits. Not all that men or
   devils can do can hinder us of the divine protection and provision.
   This day let us pray the Lord to stablish and keep us.

   March 25


   "When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie
   down, and thy sleep shall be sweet" Prov. 3:24

   Is the reader likely to be confined for a while to the bed by sickness?
   Let him go upstairs without distress with this promise upon his heart
   -- "When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid."

   When we go to bed at night, let this word smooth our pillow. We cannot
   guard ourselves in sleep, but the Lord will keep us through the night.
   Those who lie down under the protection of the Lord are as secure as
   kings and queens in their palaces, and a great deal more so. If with
   our lying down there is a laying down of all cares and ambitions, we
   shall get refreshment out of our beds such as the anxious and covetous
   never find in theirs. Ill dreams shall be banished, or even if they
   come, we shall wipe out the impression of them, knowing that they are
   only dreams.

   If we sleep thus we shall do well. How sweetly Peter slept when even
   the angel's light did not wake him, and he needed a hard jog in the
   side to wake him up. And yet he was sentenced to die on the morrow.
   Thus have martyrs slept before their burning. "So he giveth his beloved
   sleep."

   To have sweet sleep we must have sweet lives, sweet tempers, sweet
   meditations, and sweet love.

   "The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing" Ps. 41:3

   Remember that this is a promise to the man who considers the poor. Are
   you one of these? Then take home the text.

   See how in the hour of sickness the God of the poor will bless the man
   who cares for the poor! The everlasting arms shall stay up his soul as
   friendly hands and downy pillows stay up the body of the sick. How
   tender and sympathizing is this image; how near it brings our God to
   our infirmities and sicknesses! Whoever heard this of the old heathen
   Jove, or of the gods of India, or China? This is language peculiar to
   the God of Israel; He it is who deigns to become nurse and attendant
   upon good men. If He smites with one hand, He sustains with the other.
   Oh, it is blessed fainting when one falls upon the Lord's own bosom,
   and is borne thereon! Grace is the best of restoratives; divine love is
   the safest stimulant for a languishing patient; it makes the soul
   strong as a giant, even when the bones are breaking through the skin.
   No physician like the Lord, no tonic like His promise, no wine like His
   love.

   If the reader has failed in his duty to the poor, let him see what he
   is losing, and at once become their friend and helper.

   "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you" James 4:8

   The nearer we come to God, the more graciously will He reveal Himself
   to us. When the prodigal comes to his father, his father runs to meet
   him. When the wandering dove returns to the ark, Noah puts out his hand
   to pull her in unto him. When the tender wife seeks her husband's
   society, he comes to her on wings of love. Come then, dear friend, let
   us draw nigh to God who so graciously awaits us, yea, comes to meet us.

   Did you ever notice that passage in Isaiah 58:9? There the Lord seems
   to put Himself at the disposal of His people, saying to them, "Here I
   am." As much as to say -- "What have you to say to me? What can I do
   for you? I am waiting to bless you. How can we hesitate to draw near?
   God is nigh to forgive, to bless, to comfort, to help, to quicken, to
   deliver. Let it be the main point with us to get near to God. This
   done, all is done. If we draw near to others, they may before long grow
   weary of us and leave us; but if we seek the Lord alone, no change will
   come over His mind, but He will continue to come nearer and yet nearer
   to us by fuller and more joyful fellowship.

   March 28


   "The Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail" Deut. 28:13

   If we obey the Lord, He will compel our adversaries to see that His
   blessing rests upon us. Though this be a promise of the law, yet it
   stands good to the people of God; for Jesus has removed the curse, but
   He has established the blessing.

   It is for saints to lead the way among men by holy influence: they are
   not to be the tail, to be dragged hither and thither by others. We must
   not yield to the spirit of the age, but compel the age to do homage to
   Christ. If the Lord be with us, we shall not crave toleration for
   religion, but we shall seek to seat it on the throne of society. Has
   not the Lord Jesus made His people priests? Surely they are to teach,
   and must not be learners from the philosophies of unbelievers. Are we
   not in Christ made kings to reign upon the earth? How, then, can we be
   the servants of custom, the slaves of human opinion?

   Have you, dear friend, taken up your true position for Jesus? Too many
   are silent because diffident, if not cowardly. Should we allow the name
   of the Lord Jesus to be kept in the background? Should our religion
   drag along as a tail? Should it not rather lead the way and be the
   ruling force with ourselves and others?

   March 29


   "I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee" Acts 18:10

   So long as the Lord had work for Paul to do in Corinth, the fury of the
   mob was restrained. The Jews opposed themselves and blasphemed; but
   they could neither stop the preaching of the gospel, nor the conversion
   of the hearers. God has power over the most violent minds. He makes the
   wrath of man to praise Him when it breaks forth, but He still more
   displays His goodness when He restrains it; and He can restrain it. "By
   the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone, till thy
   people pass over, O Lord."

   Do not, therefore, feel any fear of man when you know that you are
   doing your duty. Go straight on, as Jesus would have done, and those
   who oppose shall be as a bruised reed and as smoking flax. Many a time
   men have had cause to fear because they were themselves afraid; but a
   dauntless faith in God brushes fear aside like the cobwebs in a giant's
   path. No man can harm us unless the Lord permits. He who makes the
   devil himself to flee at a word, can certainly control the devil's
   agents. Maybe they are already more afraid of you than you are of them.
   Therefore, go forward, and where you looked to meet with foes you will
   find friends.

   March 30

  PRAYER, THANKSGIVING, PRAISE

   "Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication
   with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus" Phil. 4:6,7

   No care, but all prayer. No anxiety, but much joyful communion with
   God. Carry your desires to the Lord of your life, the guardian of your
   soul. Go to Him with two portions of prayer, and one of fragrant
   praise. Do not pray doubtfully, but thankfully. Consider that you have
   your petitions, and therefore thank God for His grace. He is giving you
   grace, give Him thanks. Hide nothing. Allow no want to lie rankling in
   your bosom; "make known your requests." Run not to man. Go only to your
   God, the Father of Jesus, who loves you in Him.

   This shall bring you God's own peace. You shall not be able to
   understand the peace which you shall enjoy. It will enfold you in its
   infinite embrace. Heart and mind through Christ Jesus shall be steeped
   in a sea of rest. Come life or death, poverty, pain, slander, you shall
   dwell in Jesus above every ruffling wind or darkening cloud. Will you
   not obey this dear command?

   Yes, Lord, I do believe thee; but, I beseech thee, help mine unbelief.

   March 31


   "Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked,
   when it cometh. For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep
   thy foot from being taken" Prov. 3: 25,26

   When God is abroad in judgments, He would not have His people alarmed.
   He has not come forth to harm, but to defend the righteous.

   He would have them manifest courage. We who enjoy the presence of God
   ought to display presence of mind. Since the Lord Himself may suddenly
   come, we ought not to be surprised at anything sudden. Serenity under
   the rush and roar of unexpected evils is a precious gift of divine
   love.

   The Lord would have His chosen display discrimination, so that they may
   see that the desolation of the wicked is not a real calamity to the
   universe. Sin alone is evil; the punishment which follows thereupon is
   as a preserving salt to keep society from putrefying. We should be far
   more shocked at the sin which deserves hell, than at the hell which
   comes out of sin.

   So, too, should the Lord's people exhibit great quietness of spirit.
   Satan and his serpent seed are full of all subtlety; but those who walk
   with God shall not be taken in their deceitful snares. Go on, believer
   in Jesus, and let the Lord be thy confidence.

  THE KING'S HIGHWAY

   "The wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein" Isa. 35:8

   The way of holiness is so straight and plain that the simplest minds
   cannot go astray if they constantly follow it. The worldly wise have
   many twists and turns, and yet they make terrible blunders, and
   generally miss their end. Worldly policy is a poor short-sighted thing,
   and when men choose it as their road, it leads them over dark
   mountains. Gracious minds know no better than to do as the Lord bids
   them; but this keeps them in the king's highway, and under royal
   protection.

   Let the reader never for a moment attempt to help himself out of a
   difficulty by a falsehood, or by a questionable act; but let him keep
   in the middle of the high road of truth and integrity, and he will be
   following the best possible course. In our lives we must never practice
   circular sailing, nor dream of shuffling. Be just and fear not. Follow
   Jesus and heed no evil consequences. If the worst of ills could be
   avoided by wrong-doing, we should, in the very attempt, have fallen
   into an evil worse than any other ill could be. God's way must be the
   best way. Follow it though men think you a fool, and you will be truly
   wise.

   Lord, lead thy servants in a plain path because of their enemies.

   April 2

  TRUE HEART-ENERGY

   "Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
   profiting may appear to all" I Tim. 4:15

   This is, practically, a promise that, by diligent meditation and the
   giving up of our whole mind to our work for the Lord, we shall make a
   progress which all can see. Not by hasty reading, but by deep
   meditation, we profit by the Word of God. Not by doing a great deal of
   work in a slovenly manner, but by giving our best thought to what we
   attempt, we shall get real profit. "In all labor there is profit," but
   not in fuss and hurry without true heart-energy.

   If we divide ourselves between God and mammon, or Christ and self, we
   shall make no progress. We must give ourselves wholly to holy things,
   or else we shall be poor traders in heavenly business, and at our
   stock-taking no profit will be shown.

   Am I a minister? Let me be a minister wholly, and not spend my energies
   upon secondary concerns. What have I to do with party politics, or vain
   amusements? Am I a Christian? Let me make my service of Jesus my
   occupation, my lifework, my one pursuit. We must be in-and-in with
   Jesus, and then out-and-out for Jesus, or else we shall make neither
   progress nor profit, and neither the church nor the world will feel
   that forceful influence which the Lord would have us exercise.

   April 3


   "Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before
   the Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and
   against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation
   and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have
   heard thee, saith the Lord" II Kings 22:19

   Many despise warning, and perish. Happy is he who trembles at the word
   of the Lord. Josiah did so, and he was spared the sight of the evil
   which the Lord determined to send upon Judah because of her great sins.
   Have you this tenderness? Do you practice this self-humiliation? Then
   you also shall be spared in the evil day. God sets a mark upon the men
   that sigh and cry because of the sin of the times. The destroying angel
   is commanded to keep his sword in its sheath till the elect of God are
   sheltered: these are best known by their godly fear, and their
   trembling at the Word of the Lord. Are the times threatening? Do Popery
   and Infidelity advance with great strides, and do you dread national
   chastisement upon this polluted nation? Well you may. Yet rest in this
   promise, "Thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace: and thine
   eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place."
   Better still, the Lord Himself may come, and then the days of our
   mourning shall be ended.

   April 4

  GOD'S HORNETS

   "And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite,
   the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee" Exod. 23:28

   What the hornets were we need not consider. They were God's own army,
   which He sent before His people to sting their enemies, and render
   Israel's conquest easy. Our God by His own chosen means will fight for
   His people, and gall their foes, before they come into the actual
   battle. Often He confounds the adversaries of truth by methods in which
   reformers themselves have no hand. The air is full of mysterious
   influences which harass Israel's foes. We read in the Apocalypse that
   "the earth helped the woman.

   Let us never fear. The stars in their courses fight against the enemies
   of our souls. Oftentimes when we march to the conflict we find no host
   to contend with. "The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your
   peace." God's hornets can do more than our weapons. We could never
   dream of the victory being won by such means as Jehovah will use. We
   must obey our marching orders and go forth to the conquest of the
   nations for Jesus, and we shall find that the Lord has gone before us,
   and prepared the way; so that in the end we shall joyfully confess,
   "His own right hand, and his holy arm, have gotten him the victory."

   April 5


   "Thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be for gotten of me"
   Isa. 44:21

   Our Jehovah cannot so forget His servants as to cease to love them. He
   chose them not for a time, but for ever. He knew what they would be
   when He called them into the divine family. He blots out their sins
   like a cloud; and we may be sure that He will not turn them out of
   doors for iniquities which He has blotted out. It would be blasphemy to
   imagine such a thing.

   He will not forget them so as to cease to think of them. One forgetful
   moment on the part of our God would be our ruin. Therefore He says:
   "Thou shalt not be forgotten of me." Men forget us: those whom we have
   benefited turn against us: we have no abiding place in the fickle
   hearts of men; but God will never forget one of His true servants. He
   binds Himself to us not by what we do for Him, but by what He has done
   for us. We have been loved too long, and bought at too great a price to
   be now forgotten. Jesus sees in us His soul's travail, and that He
   never can forget. The Father sees in us the spouse of His Son, and the
   Spirit sees in us His own effectual work. The Lord thinketh upon us.
   This day we shall be succored and sustained. Oh, that the Lord may
   never be forgotten of us!

   April 6

  ONE KING, ONE LORD

   "And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there
   be one Lord, and his name one" Zech. 14:9

   Blessed prospect! This is no dream of an enthusiast, but the
   declaration of the infallible Word. Jehovah shall be known among all
   people, and His gracious sway shall be acknowledged by every tribe of
   man. Today, it is far from being so. Where do any bow before the Great
   King? How much there is of rebellion! What lords many, and gods many,
   there are on the earth! Even among professed Christians what
   diversities of ideas there are about Him and His gospel! One day there
   shall be one King, one Jehovah, and one name for the living God. O
   Lord, hasten it! We daily cry, Thy kingdom come.

   We will not discuss the question as to when this shall be, lest we lose
   the comfort of the certainty that it shall be. So surely as the Holy
   Ghost spake by His prophets, so surely shall the whole earth be filled
   with the glory of the Lord. Jesus did not die in vain. The Spirit of
   God worketh not in vain. The Father's eternal purposes shall not be
   frustrated. Here, where Satan triumphed, Jesus shall be crowned, and
   the Lord God Omnipotent shall reign. Let us go our way to our daily
   work and warfare made strong in faith.

   April 7


   "And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name
   of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee" Deut. 28:10

   Then we can have no reason to be afraid of them. This would show a mean
   spirit, and be a token of unbelief rather than of faith. God can make
   us so like Himself, that men shall be forced to see that we rightly
   bear His name, and truly belong to the Holy Jehovah. Oh, that we may
   obtain this grace, which the Lord waits to bestow!

   Be assured that ungodly men have a fear of true saints. They hate them,
   but they also fear them. Haman trembled because of Mordecai, even when
   he sought the good man's destruction. In fact, their hate often arises
   out of a dread which they are too proud to confess. Let us pursue the
   path of truth and uprightness without the slightest tremor. Fear is not
   for us, but for those who do ill and fight against the Lord of hosts.
   If indeed the name of the Eternal God is named upon us, we are secure;
   for, as of old, a Roman had but to say Romanus sum, I am a Roman, and
   he could claim the protection of all the legions of the vast empire; so
   every one who is a man of God has omnipotence as his guardian, and God
   will sooner empty Heaven of angels than leave a saint without defense.
   Be braver than lions for the right, for God is with you.

   April 8


   "The Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou
   hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at
   Rome" Acts 23:11

   Are you a witness for the Lord, and are you just now in danger? Then
   remember that you are immortal till your work is done. If the Lord has
   more witness for you to bear, you will live to bear it. Who is he that
   can break the vessel which the Lord intends again to use?

   If there is no more work for you to do for your Master, it cannot
   distress you that He is about to take you home, and put you where you
   will be beyond the reach of adversaries. Your witness-bearing for Jesus
   is your chief concern, and you cannot be stopped in it till it is
   finished: therefore be at peace. Cruel slander, wicked
   misrepresentation, desertion of friends, betrayal by the most trusted
   one, and whatever else may come, cannot hinder the Lord's purpose
   concerning you. The Lord stands by you in the night of your sorrow, and
   He says, "Thou must yet bear witness for me." Be calm, be filled with
   joy in the Lord.

   If you do not need this promise just now, you may very soon. Treasure
   it up. Remember also to pray for missionaries, and all persecuted ones,
   that the Lord would preserve them even to the completion of their life
   work.

   April 9

  THE BIBLE'S SUPREME PLACE

   "Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend
   them" Ps. 119:165

   Yes, a true love for the great Book will bring us great peace from the
   great God, and be a great protection to us. Let us live constantly in
   the society of the law of the Lord, and it will breed in our hearts a
   restfulness such as nothing else can. The Holy Spirit acts as a
   Comforter through the Word, and sheds abroad those benign influences
   which calm the tempests of the soul.

   Nothing is a stumblingblock to the man who has the Word of God dwelling
   in him richly. He takes up his daily cross and it becomes a delight.
   For the fiery trial he is prepared, and counts it not strange, so as to
   be utterly cast down by it. He is neither stumbled by prosperity, as so
   many are, nor crushed by adversity, as others have been; for he lives
   beyond the changing circumstances of external life. When his Lord puts
   before him some great mystery of the faith which makes others cry,
   "This is an hard saying; who can hear it?" the believer accepts it
   without question; for his intellectual difficulties are overcome by his
   reverent awe of the law of the Lord, which is to him the supreme
   authority to which he joyfully bows. Lord, work in us this love, this
   peace, this rest, this day.

   April 10


   "And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it
   upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that everyone that is bitten,
   when he looketh upon it, shall live" Num. 21:8

   This is a glorious gospel type. Jesus, numbered with the transgressors,
   hangs before us on the cross. A look to Him will heal us of the
   serpent-bite of sin; will heal us at once- 'When he looketh upon it, he
   shall live." Let the reader who is mourning his sinfulness note the
   words -- "Everyone that looketh upon it shall live." Every looker will
   find this true. I have found it so. I looked to Jesus and lived at
   once. I know I did. Reader, if you look to Jesus you will live too.
   True, you are swelling with the venom, and you see no hope. True, also
   there is no hope but this one. But this is no doubtful cure --
   "Everyone that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live."

   The brazen serpent was not lifted up as a curiosity to be gazed upon by
   the healthy; but its special purpose was for those who were "bitten."
   Jesus died as a real Saviour for real sinners. Whether the bite has
   made you a drunkard, or a thief, or an unchaste or a profane person, a
   look at the Great Saviour will heal you of these diseases, and make you
   live in holiness and communion with God. Look and live.

   April 11


   "And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his
   brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the
   least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord" Jer. 31:34

   Truly, whatever else we do not know, we know the Lord. This day is this
   promise true in our experience, and it is not a little one. The least
   believer among us knows God in Christ Jesus. Not as fully as we desire;
   but yet truly and really we know the Lord. We not only know doctrines
   about Him, but we know HIM. He is our Father and our Friend. We are
   acquainted with Him personally. We can say, "My Lord, and my God." We
   are on terms of close fellowship with God, and many a happy season do
   we spend in His holy company. We are no more strangers to our God, but
   the secret of the Lord is with us.

   This is more than nature could have taught us. Flesh and blood has not
   revealed God to us. Christ Jesus has made known the Father to our
   hearts. If, then, the Lord has made us know Himself, is not this the
   fountain of all saving knowledge? To know God is eternal life. So soon
   as we come to acquaintance with God we have the evidence of being
   quickened into newness of life. O my soul, rejoice in this knowledge,
   and bless thy God all this day!

   April 12


   "For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
   more" Jer. 31:34

   When we know the Lord, we receive the forgiveness of sins. We know Him
   as the God of Grace, passing by our transgressions. What a joyful
   discovery is this!

   But how divinely is this promise worded: the Lord promises no more to
   remember our sins! Can God forget? He says He will, and He means what
   He says. He will regard us as though we had never sinned. The great
   atonement so effectually removed all sin, that it is to the mind of God
   no more in existence. The believer is now in Christ Jesus, as accepted
   as Adam in his innocence; yea, more so, for he wears a divine
   righteousness, and that of Adam was but human.

   The Great Lord will not remember our sins so as to punish them, or so
   as to love us one atom the less because of them. As a debt when paid
   ceases to be a debt, even so doth the Lord make a complete obliteration
   of the iniquity of His people.

   When we are mourning over our transgressions and shortcomings, and this
   is our duty as long as we live, let us at the same time rejoice that
   they will never be mentioned against us. This makes us hate sin. God's
   free pardon makes us anxious never again to grieve Him by disobedience.

   April 13


   "Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
   glorious body" Phil. 3:21

   Often when we are racked with pain, and unable to think or worship, we
   feel that this indeed is "the body of our humiliation," and when we are
   tempted by the passions which rise from the flesh we do not think the
   word "vile" at all too vigorous a translation. Our bodies humble u5;
   and that is about the best thing they do for us. Oh, that we were duly
   lowly, because our bodies ally us with animals, and even link us with
   the dust!

   But our Saviour, the Lord Jesus, shall change all this. We shall be
   fashioned like His own body of glory. This will take place in all who
   believe in Jesus. By faith their souls have been transformed, and their
   bodies will undergo such a renewal as shall fit them for their
   regenerated spirits. How soon this grand transformation will happen we
   cannot tell; but the thought of it should help us to bear the trials of
   today, and all the woes of the flesh, In a little while we shall be as
   Jesus now is. No more aching brows, no more swollen limbs, no more dim
   eyes, no more fainting hearts. The old man shall be no more a bundle of
   infirmities, nor the sick man a mass of agony. "Like unto his glorious
   body." What an expression! Even our flesh shall rest in hope of such a
   resurrection!

   April 14


   "He shall choose our inheritance for us" Ps. 47:4

   Our enemies would allot us a very dreary portion, but we are not left
   in their hands. The Lord will cause us to stand in our lot, and our
   place is appointed by His infinite wisdom. A wiser mind than our own
   arranges our destiny. The ordaining of all things is with God, and we
   are glad to have it so; we choose that God should choose for us. If we
   might have our own way we would wish to let all things go in God's way.

   Being conscious of our own folly, we would not desire to rule our own
   destinies. We feel safer and more at ease when the Lord steers our
   vessel than we could possibly be if we could direct it according to our
   own judgment. Joyfully we leave the painful present and the unknown
   future with our Father, our Saviour, our Comforter.

   O my soul, this day lay down thy wishes at Jesus feet! If thou hast of
   late been somewhat wayward and willful, eager to be and to do after
   thine own mind, now dismiss thy foolish self, and place the reins in
   the Lord's hands. Say, "He shall choose." If others dispute the
   sovereignty of the Lord, and glory in the freewill of man, do thou
   answer them, "He shall choose for me." It is my freest choice to let
   Him choose. As a free agent, I elect that He should have absolute sway.

   April 15

  DESIRES OF RlGHTEOUS GRANTED

   "The desire of the righteous shall be granted" Prov. 10:24

   Because it is a righteous desire it is safe for God to grant it. It
   would be neither good for the man himself, nor for society at large,
   that such a promise should be made to the unrighteous. Let us keep the
   Lord's commands, and He will rightfully have respect to our desires.

   When righteous men are left to desire unrighteous desires, they will
   not be granted to them. But then these are not their real desires; they
   are their wanderings or blunders; and it is well that they should be
   refused. Their gracious desires shall come before the Lord, and He will
   not say them nay.

   Does the Lord deny us our requests for a time? Let the promise for
   today encourage us to ask again. Has He denied us altogether? We will
   thank Him still, for it always was our desire that He should deny us if
   He judged a denial to be best.

   As to some things, we ask very boldly. Our chief desires are for
   holiness, usefulness, likeness to Christ, preparedness for Heaven.
   These are the desires of grace rather than of nature -- the desires of
   the righteous man rather than of the mere man. God will not stint us in
   these things, but will do for us exceeding abundantly. "Delight thyself
   also in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart."
   This day, my soul, ask largely!

   April 16


   "In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO
   THE LORD" Zech. 14:20

   Happy day when all things shall be consecrated, and the horses' bells
   shall ring out holiness to the Lord! That day has come to me. Do I not
   make all things holy to God? These garments, when I put them on or take
   them off, shall they not remind me of the righteousness of Christ
   Jesus, my Lord? Shall not my work be done as unto the Lord? Oh, that
   today my clothes may be vestments, my meals sacraments, my house a
   temple, my table an altar, my speech incense, and myself a priest!
   Lord, fulfill thy promise, and let nothing be to me common or unclean.

   Let me in faith expect this. Believing it to be so, I shall be helped
   to make it so. As I myself am the property of Jesus, my Lord may take
   an inventory of all I have, for it is altogether His own; and I resolve
   to prove it to be so by the use to which I put it this day. From
   morning till evening I would order all things by a happy and holy rule.
   My bells shall ring -why should they not? Even my horses shall have
   bells -- who has such a right to music as the saints have? But all my
   bells, my music, my mirth, shall be turned to holiness, and shall ring
   out the name of "The Happy God."

   "When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at
   peace with him" Prov. 16:7

   I must see that my ways please the Lord. Even then I shall have
   enemies; and, perhaps, all the more certainly because I endeavor to do
   that which is right. But what a promise this is! The Lord will make the
   wrath of man to praise Him, and abate it so that it shall not distress
   me.

   He can constrain an enemy to desist from harming me, even though he has
   a mind to do so. This He did with Laban, who pursued Jacob, but did not
   dare to touch him. Or He can subdue the wrath of the enemy, and make
   him friendly, as He did with Esau, who met Jacob in a brotherly manner,
   though Jacob had dreaded that he would smite him and his family with
   the sword. The Lord can also convert a furious adversary into a brother
   in Christ, and a fellow-worker, as He did with Saul of Tarsus. Oh, that
   He would do this in every case where a persecuting spirit appears!

   Happy is the man whose enemies are made to be to him what the lions
   were to Daniel in the den, quiet and companionable! When I meet death,
   who is called the last enemy, I pray that I may be at peace. Only let
   my great care be to please the Lord in all things. Oh, for faith and
   holiness; for these are a pleasure unto the Most High!

   "I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" Josh. 1:5

   This word to Joshua is often quoted; it is the basis of that New
   Testament word, "He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake
   thee."

   Beloved, a life of warfare is before us, but the Lord of Hosts is with
   us. Are we called to lead a great but fickle people? This promise
   guarantees us all the wisdom and prudence that we shall need. Have we
   to contend with cunning and powerful enemies? Here is strength and
   valor, prowess and victory. Have we a vast heritage to win? By this
   sign we shall achieve our purpose; the Lord Himself is with us.

   It would be woe to us indeed if Jehovah could fail us; but, as this can
   never be, the winds of disquietude are laid to sleep in the caverns of
   divine faithfulness. On no one Occasion will the Lord desert us. Happen
   what may, He will be at our side. Friends drop from us, their help is
   but an April shower; but God is faithful, Jesus is the same for ever,
   and the Holy Spirit abideth in us.

   Come, my heart, be calm and hopeful today. Clouds may gather, but the
   Lord can blow them away. Since God will not fail me, my faith shall not
   fail; and, as He will not forsake me, neither will I forsake Him. Oh
   for a restful faith!

   April 19


   "For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search my
   sheep, and seek them out" Exod. 34:11

   This He does at the first when His elect are like wandering sheep that
   know not the Shepherd or the fold. How wonderfully doth the Lord find
   out His chosen! Jesus is great as a seeking Shepherd as well as a
   saving Shepherd. Though many of those His Father gave Him have gone as
   near to hell-gate as they well can, yet the Lord by searching and
   seeking discovers them, and draws nigh to them in grace. He has sought
   out us: let us have good hope for those who are laid upon our hearts in
   prayer, for He will find them out also.

   The Lord repeats this process when any of His flock stray from the
   pastures of truth and holiness. They may fall into gross error, sad
   sin, and grievous hardness; but yet the Lord, who has become a surety
   for them to His Father, will not suffer one of them to go so far as to
   perish. He will by providence and grace pursue them into foreign lands,
   into abodes of poverty, into dens of obscurity, into deeps of despair;
   He will not lose one of all that the Father has given Him. It is a
   point of honor with Jesus to seek and to save all the flock, without a
   single exception. What a promise to plead, if at this hour I am
   compelled to cry, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep"!

   April 20


   "The just shall live by faith" Rom. 1:17

   I shall not die. I can, I do believe in the Lord my God, and this faith
   will keep me alive. I would be numbered among those who in their lives
   are just; but even if I were perfect I would not try to live by my
   righteousness; I would cling to the work of the Lord Jesus, and still
   live by faith in Him and by nothing else. If I were able to give my
   body to be burned for my Lord Jesus, yet I would not trust in my own
   courage and constancy, but still would live by faith.


   "Were I a martyr at the stake

   I'd plead my Saviour's name;

   Intreat a pardon for His sake,

   And urge no other claim."

   To live by faith is a far surer and happier thing than to live by
   feelings or by works. The branch, by living in the vine, lives a better
   life than it would live by itself, even if it were possible for it to
   live at all apart from the stem. To live by clinging to Jesus, by
   deriving all from Him, is a sweet and sacred thing. If even the most
   just must live in this fashion, how much more must I who am a poor
   sinner! Lord, I believe. I must trust Thee wholly. What else can I do?
   Trusting Thee is my life. I feel it to be so. I will abide by this even
   to the end.

   April 21


   "He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which
   he hath given will he pay him again" Prov. 19:17

   We are to give to the poor out of pity. Not to be seen and applauded,
   much less to get influence over them; but out of pure sympathy and
   compassion we must give them help.

   We must not expect to get anything back from the poor, not even
   gratitude; but we should regard what we have done as a loan to the
   Lord. He undertakes the obligation, and, if we look to Him in the
   matter, we must not look to the second party. What an honor the Lord
   bestows upon us when He condescends to borrow of us! That merchant is
   greatly favored who has the Lord on his books. It would seem a pity to
   have such a name down for a paltry pittance; let us make it a heavy
   amount. The next needy man that comes this way, let us help him.

   As for repayment we can hardly think of it, and yet here is the Lord's
   note of hand. Blessed be His name, His promise to pay is better than
   gold and silver. Are we running a little short through the depression
   of the times? We may venture humbly to present this bill at the Bank of
   Faith. Has any one of our readers been a bit of a screw to the poor?
   Poor soul. May the Lord forgive him.

   April 22


   "The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord raiseth them that are
   bowed down" Ps. 146:8

   Am I bowed down? Then let me urge this word of grace before the Lord.
   It is His way, His custom, His promise, His delight, to raise up them
   that are bowed down. Is it a sense of sin, and a consequent depression
   of spirit, which now distresses me? Then the work of Jesus is, in this
   case, made and provided to raise me up into rest. O Lord, raise me, for
   thy mercy's sake!

   Is it a sad bereavement, or a great fall in circumstances? Here again
   the Comforter has undertaken to console. What a mercy for us that one
   person of the Sacred Trinity should become the Comforter! This work
   will be well done, since such a glorious One has made it His peculiar
   care.

   Some are so bowed down that only Jesus can loose them from their
   infirmity, but He can, and He will, do it. He can raise us up to
   health, to hope, to happiness. He has often done so under former
   trials, and He is the same Saviour, and will repeat His deeds of
   lovingkindness. We who are today bowed down and sorrowful, shall yet be
   set on high, and those who now mock at us shall be greatly ashamed.
   What an honor to be raised up by the Lord! It is worth while to be
   bowed down that we may experience His upraising power.

   April 23


   "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
   churches; he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death"
   Rev. 2:11

   The first death we must endure unless the Lord should suddenly come to
   His temple. For this let us abide in readiness, awaiting it without
   fear, since Jesus has transformed death from a dreary cavern into a
   passage leading to glory.

   The thing to be feared is not the first, but the second death; not the
   parting of the soul from the body, but the final separation of the
   entire man from God. This is death indeed. This death kills all peace,
   joy, happiness, hope. When God is gone all is gone. Such a death is far
   worse than ceasing to be: it is existence without the life which makes
   existence worth the having.

   Now, if by God's grace we fight on to the end, and conquer in the
   glorious war, no second death can lay its chill finger upon us. We
   shall have no fear of death and hell, for we shall receive a crown of
   life which fadeth not away. How this nerves us for the fight! Eternal
   life is worth a life's battle. To escape the hurt of the second death
   is a thing worth struggling for throughout a lifetime.

   Lord, give us faith, so that we may overcome, and then grant us grace
   to remain unharmed though sin and Satan dog our heels!

   April 24


   "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in
   mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I
   will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing,
   that there shall not be room enough to receive it," Mal. 3:10

   Many read and plead this promise without noticing the condition upon
   which the blessing is promised. We cannot expect Heaven to be opened or
   blessing poured out unless we pay our dues unto the Lord our God and to
   His cause. There would be no lack of funds for holy purposes if all
   professing Christians paid their fair share.

   Many are poor because they rob God. Many churches, also, miss the
   visitations of the Spirit because they starve their ministers. If there
   is no temporal meat for God's servants, we need not wonder if their
   ministry has but little food in it for our souls. When missions pine
   for means, and the work of the Lord is hindered by an empty treasury,
   how can we look for a large amount of soul-prosperity?

   Come, come! What have I given of late? Have I been mean to my God? Have
   I stinted my Saviour? This will never do. Let me give my Lord Jesus His
   tithe by helping the poor, and aiding His work, and then I shall prove
   His power to bless me on a large scale.

   April 25


   "The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after
   him" Prov. 20:7

   Anxiety about our family is natural, but we shall be wise if we turn it
   into care about our own character. If we walk before the Lord in
   integrity, we shall do more to bless our descendants than if we
   bequeathed them large estates. A father's holy life is a rich legacy
   for his sons.

   The upright man leaves his heirs his example, and this in itself will
   be a mine of true wealth. How many men may trace their success in life
   to the example of their parents!

   He leaves them also his repute. Men think all the better of us as the
   sons of a man who could be trusted, the successors of a tradesman of
   excellent repute. Oh, that all young men were anxious to keep up the
   family name!

   Above all, he leaves his children his prayers and the blessing of a
   prayer-hearing God, and these make our offspring to be favored among
   the sons of men. God will save them even after we are dead. Oh, that
   they might be saved at once!

   Our integrity may be God's means of saving our sons and daughters. If
   they see the truth of our religion proved by our lives, it may be that
   they will believe in Jesus for themselves. Lord, fulfill this word to
   my household!

   April 26


   "And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest" Deut.
   15:18

   An Israelitish master was to give his bondservant liberty in due time,
   and when he left his service he was to start him in life with a liberal
   portion. This was to be done heartily and cheerfully, and then the Lord
   promised to bless the generous act. The spirit of this precept, and,
   indeed, the whole law of Christ, binds us to treat work-people well. We
   ought to remember how the Lord has dealt with us, and that this renders
   it absolutely needful that we should deal graciously with others. It
   becomes those to be generous who are the children of a gracious God.
   How can we expect our great Master to bless us in our business if we
   oppress those who serve us?

   What a benediction is here set before the liberal mind! To be blessed
   in all that we do is to be blessed indeed. The Lord will send us this
   partly in prosperity, partly in content of mind, and partly in a sense
   of His favor, which is the best of all blessings. He can make us feel
   that we are under His special care, and are surrounded by His peculiar
   love. This makes this earthly life a joyous prelude to the life to
   come. God's blessing is more than a fortune. It maketh rich, and addeth
   no sorrow therewith.

   April 27


   "The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me" Ps. 138:8

   He who has begun will carry on the work which is being wrought within
   my soul. The Lord is concerned about everything that concerns me. All
   that is now good, but not perfect, the Lord will watch over, and
   preserve, and carry out to completion. This is a great comfort. I could
   not perfect the work of grace myself. Of that I am quite sure, for I
   fail every day, and have only held on so long as I have because the
   Lord has helped me. If the Lord were to leave me, all my past
   experience would go for nothing, and I should perish from the way. But
   the Lord will continue to bless me. He will perfect my faith, my love,
   my character, my life-work. He will do this because He has begun a work
   in me. He gave me the concern I feel, and, in a measure, He has
   fulfilled my gracious aspirations. He never leaves a work unfinished;
   this would not be for His glory, nor would it be like Him. He knows how
   to accomplish His gracious design, and though my own evil nature and
   the world, and the devil, all conspire to hinder Him, I do not doubt
   His promise. He will perfect that which concerneth me, and I will
   praise Him for ever. Lord, let thy gracious work make some advance this
   day!

   April 28


   "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and
   they shall be my people" II Cor. 6:16

   Here is a mutual interest. Each belongs to each. God is the portion of
   His people, and the chosen people are the portion of their God. The
   saints find in God their chief possession, and He reckons them to be
   His peculiar treasure. What a mine of comfort lies in this fact for
   each believer!

   This happy condition of mutual interest leads to mutual consideration.
   God will always think of His own people, and they will always think of
   Him. This day my God will perform all things for me; what can I do for
   Him? My thoughts ought to run toward Him, for He thinketh upon me. Let
   me make sure that it is so, and not be content with merely admitting
   that so it ought to be.

   This, again, leads to mutual fellowship. God dwells in us, and we dwell
   in Him; He walks with us and we walk with God. Happy communion this!

   Oh, for grace to treat the Lord as my God: to trust Him and to serve
   Him, as His Godhead deserves! Oh, that I could love, worship, adore,
   and obey Jehovah in spirit and in truth! this is my heart's desire.
   When I shall attain to it, I shall have found my Heaven. Lord, help me!
   Be my God in helping me to know thee as my God, for Jesus' sake.

   April 29


   "Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the Lord, and he
   shall save thee" Prov. 20:22

   Be not in haste. Let anger cool down. Say nothing and do nothing to
   avenge yourself. You will be sure to act unwisely if you take up the
   cudgels and fight your own battles; and, certainly, you will not show
   the spirit of the Lord Jesus. It is nobler to forgive, and let the
   offense pass. To let an injury rankle in your bosom, and to meditate
   revenge, is to keep old wounds open, and to make new ones. Better
   forget and forgive.

   Peradventure, you say that you must do something or be a great loser;
   then do what this morning's promise advises: "Wait on the Lord, and he
   shall save thee." This advice will not cost you money, but is worth far
   more. Be calm and quiet. Wait upon the Lord: tell Him your grievance:
   spread Rabshakeh's letter before the Lord, and this of itself will be
   an ease to your burdened mind. Besides, there is the promise, "He shall
   save thee." God will find a way of deliverance for you. How He will do
   it neither you nor I can guess, but do it He will. If the Lord save
   you, this will be a deal better than getting into petty quarrels, and
   covering yourself with filth by wrestling with the unclean. Be no more
   angry. Leave your suit with the Judge of all.

   April 30

  THE OVERCOMER'S REWARD

   "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and
   will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which
   no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it" Rev. 2:17

   My heart, be thou stirred up to persevere in the holy war, for the
   reward of victory is great. Today we eat of heavenly food which falls
   about our camps; the food of the wilderness, the food which comes from
   Heaven, the food which never fails the pilgrims to Canaan. But there is
   reserved for us in Christ Jesus a still higher degree of spiritual
   life, and a food for it which, as yet is hidden from our experience. In
   the golden pot which was laid up in the ark there was a portion of
   manna hidden away, which though kept for ages never grew stale. No one
   ever saw it; it was hid with the ark of the covenant, in the Holy of
   Holies. Even so, the highest life of the believer is hid with Christ,
   in God. We shall come to it soon. Being made victorious through the
   grace of our Lord Jesus, we shall eat of the King's meat, and feed upon
   royal dainties. We shall feed upon Jesus. He is our "hidden manna" as
   well as the manna of the wilderness. He is all in all to us in our
   highest, as well as in our lowest estate. He helps us to fight, gives
   us the victory, and then is Himself our reward. Lord, help me to
   overcome.

   "The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing,
   and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands" Isa. 55:12

   When sin is pardoned, our greatest sorrow is ended, and our truest
   pleasure begins. Such is the joy which the Lord bestows upon His
   reconciled ones, that it overflows and fills all nature with delight.
   The material world has latent music in it, and a renewed heart knows
   how to bring it out and make it vocal. Creation is the organ, and a
   gracious man finds out its keys, lays his hand thereon, and wakes the
   whole system of the universe to the harmony of praise. Mountains and
   hills, and other great objects, are, as it were, the bass of the
   chorus; while the trees of the wood, and all things that have life,
   take up the air of the melodious song.

   When God's Word is made to prosper among us, and souls are saved, then
   everything seems full of song. When we hear the confessions of young
   believers, and the testimonies of well-instructed saints, we are made
   so happy that we must praise the Lord, and then it seems as if rocks
   and hills, and woods and fields, echoed our joy-notes, and turned the
   world into an orchestra. Lord, on this happy Mayday, lead me out into
   thy tuneful world as rich in praise as a lark in full song.

   May 2


   "He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
   everlasting" Gal. 6:8

   Sowing looks like a losing business, for we put good corn into the
   ground never to see it any more. Sowing to the Spirit seems a very
   fanciful, dreamy business; for we deny ourselves, and apparently get
   nothing for it. Yet if we sow to the Spirit by studying to live unto
   God, seeking to obey the will of God, and laying ourselves out to
   promote His honor, we shall not sow in vain. Life shall be our reward,
   even everlasting life. This we enjoy here as we enter into the
   knowledge of God, communion with God, and enjoyment of God. This life
   flows on like an ever-deepening, ever-widening river, till it bears us
   to the ocean of infinite felicity, where the life of God is ours for
   ever and ever.

   Let us not this day sow to our flesh, for the harvest will be
   corruption, since flesh always tends that way; but with holy
   self-conquest let us live for the highest, purest, and most spiritual
   ends, seeking to honor our most holy Lord by obeying His most gracious
   Spirit. What a harvest will that be when we reap life everlasting! What
   sheaves of endless bliss will be reaped! What a festival will that
   harvest be! Lord, make us such reapers, for thy Son's sake.

   May 3


   "And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of
   the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall
   the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines" II
   Sam. 5:24

   There are signs of the Lord's moving which should move us. The Spirit
   of God blows where He listeth, and we hear the sound thereof. Then is
   the time for us to be more than ever astir. We must seize the golden
   opportunity, and make the most we can of it. It is ours to fight the
   Philistines at all times; but when the Lord Himself goes out before us,
   then we should be specially valiant in the war.

   The breeze stirred the tops of the trees, and David and his men took
   this for the signal for an onslaught, and at their advance the Lord,
   Himself, smote the Philistines. Oh, that this day the Lord may give us
   an opening to speak for Him with many of our friends! Let us be on the
   watch to avail ourselves of the hopeful opening when it comes. Who
   knows but this may be a day of good tidings; a season of soul-winning.
   Let us keep our ear open to hear the rustle of the wind, and our minds
   ready to obey the signal. Is not this promise, "then shall the Lord go
   out before thee," a sufficient encouragement to play the man? Since the
   Lord goes before us, we dare not hold back.

   May 4


   "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when
   I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me" Micah 7:8

   This may express the feeling of a man or woman down-trodden and
   oppressed. Our enemy may put out our light for a season. There is sure
   hope for us in the Lord; and if we are trusting in Him, and holding
   fast our integrity, our season of down-casting and darkness will soon
   be over. The insults of the foe are only for a moment. The Lord will
   soon turn their laughter into lamentation, and our sighing into
   singing.

   What if the great enemy of souls should for a while triumph over us, as
   he has triumphed over better men than we are, yet let us take heart,
   for we shall overcome him before long. We shall rise from our fall, for
   our God has not fallen, and He will lift us up. We shall not abide in
   darkness, although for the moment we sit in it; for our Lord is the
   fountain of light, and He will soon bring us a joyful day. Let us not
   despair, or even doubt. One turn of the wheel and the lowest will be at
   the top. Woe unto those who laugh now, for they shall mourn and weep
   when their boasting is turned into everlasting contempt. But blessed
   are all holy mourners, for they shall be divinely comforted.

  WHY REMAIN CAPTIVE?

   "The Lord thy God will turn thy captivity" Deut. 30:3

   God's own people may sell themselves into captivity by sin. A very
   bitter fruit is this, of an exceeding bitter root. What a bondage it is
   when the child of God is sold under sin, held in chains by Satan,
   deprived of his liberty, robbed of his power in prayer, and his delight
   in the Lord! Let us watch that we come not into such bondage; but if
   this has already happened to us, let us by no means despair.

   But we cannot be held in slavery for ever. The Lord Jesus has paid too
   high a price for our redemption to leave us in the enemy's hand. The
   way to freedom is, "Return unto the Lord thy God." Where we first found
   salvation we shall find it again. At the foot of Christ's cross
   confessing sin we shall find pardon and deliverance. Moreover, the Lord
   will have us obey His voice according to all that He has commanded us,
   and we must do this with all our heart, and all our soul, and then our
   captivity shall end.

   Often depression of spirit and great misery of soul are removed as soon
   as we quit our idols and bow ourselves in obedience before the living
   God. We need not be captives. We may return to Zion's citizenship, and
   that speedily. Lord, turn our captivity!

   May 6


   "Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord
   all the day long. For surely there is an end; and thine expectation
   shall not be cut off" Prov. 23:17, 18

   When we see the wicked prosper we are apt to envy them. When we hear
   the noise of their mirth, and our own spirit is heavy, we half think
   that they have the best of it. This is foolish and sinful. If we knew
   them better, and specially if we remembered their end, we should pity
   them.

   The cure for envy lies in living under a constant sense of the divine
   presence, worshiping God and communing with Him all the day long,
   however long the day may seem. True religion lifts the soul into a
   higher region, where the judgment becomes more clear, and the desires
   are more elevated. The more of Heaven there is in our lives, the less
   of earth we shall covet. The fear of God casts out envy of men.

   The death-blow of envy is a calm consideration of the future. The
   wealth and glory of the ungodly are a vain show. This pompous
   appearance flashes out for an hour, and then is extinguished. What is
   the prosperous sinner the better for his prosperity when judgment
   overtakes him? As for the godly man, his end is peace and blessedness,
   and none can rob him of his joy; wherefore, let him forego envy, and be
   filled with sweet content.

   May 7


   "And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that
   the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee
   mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath
   sworn unto thy fathers" Deut. 13:17

   Israel must conquer idolatrous cities, and destroy all the spoil,
   regarding all that had been polluted by idolatry as an accursed thing
   to be burned with fire. Now, sin of all sorts must be treated by
   Christians in the same manner. We must not allow a single evil habit to
   remain. It is now war to the knife with sins of all sorts and sizes,
   whether of the body, the mind, or the spirit. We do not look upon this
   giving up of evil as deserving mercy, but we regard it as a fruit of
   the grace of God, which we would on no account miss.

   When God causes us to have no mercy on our sins, then He has great
   mercy on us. When we are angry with evil, God is no more angry with us.
   When we multiply our efforts against iniquity, the Lord multiplies our
   blessings. The way of peace, of growth, of safety, of joy in Christ
   Jesus, will be found by following out these words: "There shall nought
   of the cursed thing cleave to thine hand." Lord, purify me this day.
   Compassion, prosperity, increase, and joy, will surely be given to
   those who put away sin with solemn resolution.

   "Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye
   receive" Matt. 20:7

   Yes, there is work in Christ's vineyard for old bodies. It is the
   eleventh hour, and yet He will let us work. What great grace is this!
   Surely every old man ought to jump at this invitation! After men are
   advanced in years nobody wants them as servants; they go from shop to
   shop, and employers look at their grey hairs, and shake their heads.
   But Jesus will engage old people, and give them good wages too! This is
   mercy indeed. Lord, help the aged to enlist in thy service without an
   hour's delay.

   But will the Lord pay wages to worn-out old men? Do not doubt it. He
   says He will give you what is right if you will work in His field. He
   will surely give you grace here and glory hereafter. He will grant
   present comfort and future rest; strength equal to your day, and a
   vision of glory when the night of death comes on. All these the Lord
   Jesus will as freely give to the aged convert as to one who enters His
   service in his youth.

   Let me tell this to some unsaved old man or old woman, and pray the
   Lord to bless it, for Jesus sake. Where can I find such persons? I will
   be on the look-out for them, and kindly tell them the news.

   "For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his
   holy name" Ps. 33:21

   The root of faith produces the flower of heart-joy. We may not at the
   first rejoice, but it comes in due time. We trust the Lord when we are
   sad, and in due season He so answers our confidence that our faith
   turns to fruition and we rejoice in the Lord. Doubt breeds distress,
   but trust means joy in the long run.

   The assurance expressed by the Psalmist in this verse is really a
   promise held out in the hands of holy confidence. Oh for grace to
   appropriate it. If we do not rejoice at this moment, yet we shall do
   so, as surely as David's God is our God.

   Let us meditate upon the Lord's holy name, that we may trust Him the
   better and rejoice the more readily. He is in character holy, just,
   true, gracious, faithful and unchanging. Is not such a God to be
   trusted? He is all-wise, almighty, and everywhere present; can we not
   cheerfully rely upon Him? Yes, we will do so at once, and do so without
   reserve. Jehovah-Jireh will provide, Jehovah-Shalom will send peace,
   Jehovah-Tsidkenu will justify, Jehovah-Shammah will be for ever near,
   and in Jehovah-Nissi we will conquer every foe. They that know thy name
   will trust thee; and they that trust thee will rejoice in thee, O Lord.

   "So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
   what man shall do unto me" Heb. 13:6

   Because God will never leave nor forsake us, we may well be content
   with such things as we have. Since the Lord is ours, we cannot be left
   without a friend, a treasure, and a dwelling-place. This assurance may
   make us feel quite independent of men. Under such high patronage we do
   not feel tempted to cringe before our fellowmen, and ask of them
   permission to call our lives our own; but what we say we boldly say,
   and defy contradiction.

   He who fears God has nothing else to fear. We should stand in such awe
   of the living Lord that all the threats that can be used by the
   proudest persecutor should have no more effect upon us than the
   whistling of the wind. Man in these days cannot do so much against us
   as he could when the apostle wrote the verse at the head of this page.
   Racks and stakes are out of fashion. Giant Pope cannot burn the
   pilgrims now. If the followers of false teachers try cruel mockery and
   scorn, we do not wonder at it, for the men of this world cannot love
   the heavenly seed. What then? We must bear the world's scorn. It breaks
   no bones. God helping us, let us be bold, and when the world rages let
   it rage, but let us not fear it.

   "Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last."
   Gen. 49:19

   Some of us have been like the tribe of Gad. Our adversaries for a while
   were too many for us, they came upon us like a troop. Yes, and for the
   moment they overcame us; and they exulted greatly because of their
   temporary victory. Thus they only proved the first part of the family
   heritage to be really ours, for Christ's people, like Dan, shall have a
   troop overcoming them. This being overcome is very painful, and we
   should have despaired if we had not by faith believed the second line
   of our father's benediction, "He shall overcome at the last." "All's
   well that ends well," said the world's poet; and he spoke the truth. A
   war is to be judged, not by first successes or defeats, but by that
   which happens "at the last." The Lord will give to truth and
   righteousness victory "at the last"; and, as Mr. Bunyan says, that
   means for ever, for nothing can come after the last.

   What we need is patient perseverance in well-doing, calm confidence in
   our glorious Captain. Christ, our Lord Jesus, would teach us His holy
   art of setting the face like a flint to go through with work or
   suffering till we can say, "It is finished." Hallelujah. Victory!
   Victory! We believe the promise. "He shall overcome at the last."

   May 12


   "Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof; so he that
   waiteth on his master shall be honored" Prov. 27:18

   He who tends the fig tree has figs for his pains, and he who waits on a
   good master has honor as his reward. Truly the Lord Jesus is the very
   best of masters, and it is an honor to be allowed to do the least act
   for His sake. To serve some lords is to watch over a crab tree and eat
   the crabs as one's wages; but to serve my Lord Jesus is to keep a fig
   tree of the sweetest figs. His service is in itself delight,
   continuance in it is promotion, success in it is blessedness below, and
   the reward for it is glory above.

   Our greatest honors will be gathered in that season when the figs will
   be ripe, even in the next world. Angels who are now our servitors will
   bear us home when our day's work is done. Heaven, where Jesus is, will
   be our honorable mansion, eternal bliss our honorable portion, and the
   Lord Himself our honorable companion. Who can imagine the full meaning
   of this promise, "He that waiteth on his master shall be honored"?

   Lord, help me to wait upon my Master. Let me leave all idea of honor to
   the hour when thou thyself shalt honor me. May thy Holy Spirit make me
   a lowly and patient worker and waiter!

   May 13


   "And I will give him the morning star" Rev. 2:28

   Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, what a blessing it is
   to see in Jesus "the morning star"! I remember when we read in the
   newspapers the idle tale that the star of Bethlehem had again appeared.
   On inquiry we found that it was only "the morning star"; but no great
   mistake had been made after all.

   It is best to see Jesus as the sun; but when we cannot do so, the next
   best thing is to see Him as that star which prophesies the day, and
   shows that the eternal light is near at hand. If I am not today all
   that I hope to be, yet I see Jesus, and that assures me that I shall
   one day be like Him. A sight of Jesus by faith is the pledge of
   beholding Him in His glory and being transformed into His image. If I
   have not at this hour all the light and joy I could desire, yet I shall
   have it; for as surely as I see the morning star I shall see the day.
   The morning star is never far from the sun.

   Come, my soul, has the Lord given thee the morning star? Dost thou hold
   fast that truth, grace, hope, and love which the Lord has given thee?
   Then in this thou hast the dawn of coming glory. He that makes thee
   overcome evil, and persevere in righteousness, has therein given thee
   the morning star.

   "Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will
   heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up Hosea 6:1

   It is the Lord's way to tear before He heals. This is the honest love
   of His heart, and the sure surgery of His hand. He also bruises before
   He binds up, or else it would be uncertain work. The law comes before
   the gospel; the sense of need before the supply of it. Is the reader
   now under the convincing, crushing hand of the Spirit? Has he received
   the spirit of bondage again to fear? This is a salutary preliminary to
   real gospel healing and binding up.

   Do not despair, dear heart, but come to the Lord with all thy jagged
   wounds, black bruises, and running sores. He alone can heal, and He
   delights to do it. It is our Lord's office to bind up the
   brokenhearted, and He is gloriously at home at it. Let us not linger,
   but at once return unto the Lord from whom we have gone astray. Let us
   show Him our gaping wounds, and beseech Him to know His own work, and
   complete it. Will a surgeon make an incision, and then leave his
   patient to bleed to death? Will the Lord pull down our old house, and
   then refuse to build us a better one? Dost thou ever wantonly increase
   the misery of poor anxious souls? That be far from thee, O Lord.

   May 15

  GOD'S HIGH PLACES

   "I will set him on high because he hath known my name Ps. 91:14

   Does the Lord say this to me? Yes, if I have known His name. Blessed be
   the Lord, I am no stranger to Him. I have tried Him, and proved Him,
   and known Him, and, therefore, do I trust Him. I know His name as a
   sin-hating God, for by His Spirit's convincing power I have been taught
   that He will never wink at evil. But I also know Him as the
   sin-pardoning God in Christ Jesus, for He has forgiven me all
   trespasses. His name is faithfulness, and I know it, for He has never
   forsaken me though my troubles have multiplied upon me.

   This knowledge is a gift of grace, and the Lord makes it to be the
   reason why He grants another grace-gift, namely, setting on high. This
   is grace upon grace. Observe that if we climb on high, the position may
   be dangerous; but if the Lord sets us there, it is safe. He may raise
   us to great usefulness, to eminent experience, to success in service,
   to leadership among workers, to a father's place among the little ones.
   If He does not do this, He may set us on high by near fellowship, clear
   insight, holy triumph, and gracious anticipation of eternal glory. When
   God sets us on high, Satan himself cannot pull us down. Oh, that this
   may be our case all through this day!

   May 16


   "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" Matt. 5:7

   It is not meet that the man who will not forgive should be forgiven,
   nor shall he who will not give to the poor have his own wants relieved.
   God will measure to us with our own bushels, and those who have been
   hard masters and hard creditors, will find that the Lord will deal
   hardly with them. "He shall have judgment without mercy, that hath
   shewed no mercy."

   This day let us try to give and to forgive. Let us mind the two bears
   -- bear and forbear. Let us be kind, and gentle, and tender. Let us not
   put harsh constructions upon men's conduct, nor drive hard bargains,
   nor pick foolish quarrels, nor be difficult to please. Surely we wish
   to be blessed, and we also want to obtain mercy: let us be merciful,
   that we may have mercy. Let us fulfill the condition, that we may earn
   the beatitude. Is it not a pleasant duty to be kind? Is there not much
   more sweetness in it than in being angry and ungenerous? Why, there is
   a blessedness in the thing itself! Moreover, the obtaining of mercy is
   a rich reward. What but sovereign grace could suggest such a promise as
   this? We are merciful to our fellow-mortal in pence, and the Lord
   forgives us ''all that debt.''

   "The upright shall have good things in possession" Prov. 28:10

   The Book of Proverbs is also a Book of Promises. Promises ought to be
   proverbs among the people of God. This is a very remarkable one. We are
   accustomed to think of our good things as in reversion, but here we are
   told that we shall have them in possession.

   Not all the malice and cunning of our enemies can work our destruction:
   they shall fall into the pit which they have digged. Our inheritance is
   so entailed upon us that we shall not be kept out of it, nor so turned
   out of the way as to miss it.

   But what have we now? We have a quiet conscience through the precious
   blood of Jesus. We have the love of God set upon us beyond all change.
   We have power with God in prayer in all time of need. We have the
   providence of God to watch over us, the angels of God to minister to
   us, and, above all, the Spirit of God to dwell in us. In fact, all
   things are ours. "Whether things present or things to come: all are
   yours.'' Jesus is ours. Yea, the divine trinity in unity is ours.
   Hallelujah. Let us not pine and whine, and stint and slave, since we
   have good things in possession. Let us live on our God and rejoice in
   Him all the day. Help us, O Holy Ghost!

   May 18


   "And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten" Joel
   2:25

   Yes, those wasted years over which we sigh shall be restored to us. God
   can give us such plentiful grace that we shall crowd into the remainder
   of our days as much of service as will be some recompense for those
   years of unregeneracy over which we mourn in humble penitence.

   The locusts of backsliding, worldliness, lukewarmness, are now viewed
   by us as a terrible plague. Oh, that they had never come near us! The
   Lord in mercy has now taken them away, and we are full of zeal to serve
   Him. Blessed be His name, we can raise such harvests of spiritual
   graces as shall make our former barrenness to disappear. Through rich
   grace we can turn to account our bitter experience, and use it to warn
   others. We can become the more rooted in humility, childlike
   dependence, and penitent spirituality, by reason of our former
   shortcomings. If we are the more watchful, zealous, and tender, we
   shall gain by our lamentable losses. The wasted years, by a miracle of
   love, can be restored. Does it seem too great a boon? Let us believe
   for it, and live for it, and we may yet realize it, even as Peter
   became all the more useful a man after his presumption was cured by his
   discovered weakness. Lord, aid us by thy grace.

   May 19


   "Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou return, then will I bring thee
   again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the
   precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth" Jer. 15:19

   Poor Jeremiah! Yet why do we say so? The weeping prophet was one of the
   choicest servants of God, and honored by Him above many. He was hated
   for speaking the truth. The word which was so sweet to him was bitter
   to his hearers, yet he was accepted of his Lord. He was commanded to
   abide in his faithfulness, and then the Lord would continue to speak
   through him. He was to deal boldly and truthfully with men, and perform
   the Lord's winnowing work upon the professors of his day, and then the
   Lord gave him this word, "Thou shalt be as my mouth."

   What an honor! Should not every preacher, yea, every believer, covet
   it? For God to speak by us, what a marvel! We shall speak sure, pure
   truth; and we shall speak it with power. Our word shall not return
   void; it shall be a blessing to those who receive it, and those who
   refuse it shall do so at their peril. Our lips shall feed many. We
   shall arouse the sleeping and call the dead to life.

   O dear reader, pray that it may be so with all the sent servants of our
   Lord.

   May 20


   "I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will
   break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron"
   Isa. 45:2

   This was for Cyrus; but it is evermore the heritage of all the Lord's
   own spiritual servants. Only let us go forward by faith, and our way
   will be cleared for us. Crooks and turns of human craft and Satanic
   subtlety shall be straightened for us; we shall not need to track their
   devious windings. The gates of brass shall be broken, and the iron bars
   which fastened them shall be cut asunder. We shall not need the
   battering ram nor the crowbar: the Lord Himself will do the impossible
   for us, and the unexpected shall be a fact.

   Let us not sit down in coward fear. Let us press onward in the path of
   duty; for the Lord hath said it, "I will go before thee." Ours not to
   reason why; ours but to dare and dash forward. It is the Lord's work,
   and He will enable us to do it: all impediments must yield before Him.
   Hath He not said, "I will break in pieces the gates of brass?" What can
   hinder His purpose or balk His decrees? Those who serve God have
   infinite resources. The way is clear to faith though barred to human
   strength. When Jehovah says, "I will," as He does twice in this
   promise, we dare not doubt.

   May 21

  RAIN WITHOUT CLOUDS? NEVER!

   "If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth"
   Eccl. 11:3

   Why, then, do we dread the clouds which now darken our sky? True, for a
   while they hide the sun, but the sun is not quenched; he will shine out
   again before long. Meanwhile those black clouds are filled with rain;
   and the blacker they are, the more likely they are to yield plentiful
   showers. How can we have rain without clouds?

   Our troubles have always brought us blessings, and they always will.
   They are the dark chariots of bright grace. These clouds will empty
   themselves before long, and every tender herb will be the gladder for
   the shower. Our God may drench us with grief, but He will not drown us
   with wrath; nay, He will refresh us with mercy. Our Lord's love-letters
   often come to us in black-edged envelopes. His wagons rumble, but they
   are loaded with benefit. His rod blossoms with sweet flowers and
   nourishing fruits. Let us not worry about the clouds, but sing because
   May flowers are brought to us through the April clouds and showers.

   O Lord, the clouds are the dust of thy feet! How near thou art in the
   cloudy and dark day! Love beholds thee, and is glad. Faith sees the
   clouds emptying themselves and making the little hills rejoice on every
   side.

   May 22


   "Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt
   stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy
   right hand shall save me" Ps. 138:7

   Wretched walking in the midst of trouble. Nay, blessed walking, since
   there is a special promise for it. Give me a promise, and what is the
   trouble? What doth my Lord teach me here to say? Why this "Thou wilt
   revive me." I shall have more life, more energy, more faith. Is it not
   often so, that trouble revives us, like a breath of cold air when one
   is ready to faint?

   How angry are my enemies and especially the arch-enemy! Shall I stretch
   forth my hand and fight my foes? No, my hand is better employed in
   doing service for my Lord. Besides, there is no need, for my God will
   use His far-reaching arm, and He will deal with them far better than I
   could if I were to try. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
   Lord." He will with His own right hand of power and wisdom save me, and
   what more can I desire?

   Come, my heart, talk this promise over to thyself till thou canst use
   it as the song of thy confidence, the solace of thy loneliness. Pray to
   be revived thyself, and leave the rest with the Lord, who performeth
   all things for thee.

   May 23


   "For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him
   that hath no helper" Ps. 72:12

   The needy cries; what else can he do? His cry is heard of God; what
   else need he do? Let the needy reader take to crying at once, for this
   will be his wisdom. Do not cry in the ears of friends, for even if they
   can help you it is only because the Lord enables them. The nearest way
   is to go straight to God, and let your cry come up before Him.
   Straightforward makes the best runner: run to the Lord, and not to
   secondary causes.

   "Alas!" you cry, "I have no friend or helper." So much the better; you
   can rely upon God in both capacities -- as without supplies and without
   helpers. Make your double need your double plea. Even for temporal
   mercies you may wait upon God, for He careth for His children in these
   temporary concerns. As for spiritual necessities, which are the
   heaviest of all, the Lord will hear your cry, and will deliver you and
   supply you.

   O poor friend, try your rich God. O helpless one, lean on His help. He
   has never failed me, and I am sure He will never fail you. Come as a
   beggar, and God will not refuse you help. Come with no plea but His
   grace. Jesus is King, will He let you perish of want? What! Did you
   forget this?

   May 24

  ONE A MAJORITY!

   "One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he it is
   that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you" Joshua 23:10

   Why count heads? One man with God is a majority though there be a
   thousand on the other side. Sometimes our helpers may be too many for
   God to work with them, as was the case with Gideon, who could do
   nothing till he had increased his forces by thinning out their numbers.
   But the Lord's hosts are never too few. When God would found a nation,
   He called Abram alone and blessed him. When He would vanquish proud
   Pharaoh, He used no armies, but Only Moses and Aaron. The "one man
   ministry," as certain wise men call it, has been far more used of the
   Lord than trained bands with their officers. Did all the Israelites
   together slay so many as Samson alone? Saul and his hosts slew their
   thousands, but David his ten thousands.

   The Lord can give the enemy long odds and yet vanquish him. If we have
   faith, we have God with us, and what are multitudes of men? One
   shepherd's dog can drive before him a great flock of sheep. If the Lord
   sent thee, O my brother, his strength will accomplish his divine
   purpose. Wherefore, rely on the promise, and be very courageous.

   May 25

  GOD'S TREASURY

   "The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure" Deut. 28:12

   This refers first to the rain. The Lord will give this in its season.
   Rain is the emblem of all those celestial refreshings which the Lord is
   ready to bestow upon His people. Oh for a copious shower to refresh the
   Lord's heritage!

   We seem to think that God's treasury can only be opened by a great
   prophet like Elijah, but it is not so, for this promise is to all the
   faithful in Israel, and, indeed, to each one of them. O believing
   friend, "the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure." Thou, too,
   mayest see Heaven opened, and thrust in thy hand and take out thy
   portion, yea, and a portion for all thy brethren round about thee. Ask
   what thou wilt, and thou shalt not be denied, if thou abidest in
   Christ, and His words abide in thee.

   As yet thou hast not known all thy Lord's treasures, but He shall open
   them up to thine understanding. Certainly thou hast not yet enjoyed the
   fullness of His covenant riches, but He will direct thine heart into
   His love, and reveal Jesus in thee. Only the Lord himself can do this
   for thee; but here is His promise, and if thou wilt hearken diligently
   unto His voice, and obey His will, His riches in glory by Christ Jesus
   shall be thine.

   May 26


   "Ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and
   thy water" Exod. 23:25

   What a promise is this! To serve God is in itself a high delight. But
   what an added privilege to have the blessing of the Lord resting upon
   us in all things! Our commonest things become blessed when we ourselves
   are consecrated to the Lord. Our Lord Jesus took bread and blessed it;
   behold, we also eat of blessed bread. Jesus blessed water and made it
   wine: the water which we drink is far better to us than any of the wine
   with which men make merry; every drop has a benediction in it. The
   divine blessing is on the man of God in everything, and it shall abide
   with him at every time.

   What if we have only bread and water! Yet it is blessed bread and
   water. Bread and water we shall have. That is implied, for it must be
   there for God to bless it. "Thy bread shall be given thee, and thy
   waters shall be sure." With God at our table, we not only ask a
   blessing, but we have one. It is not only at the altar but at the table
   that He blesses us. He serves those well who serve Him well. This
   table-blessing is not of debt, but of grace. Indeed, there is a
   troubled grace; He grants us grace to serve Him, by His grace feeds us
   with bread, and then in His grace blesses it.

   May 27

  AS THE LIFE -- SO THE FRUIT

   "For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall
   neither be barren nor fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
   Christ" II Peter 1:8

   If we desire to glorify our Lord by fruitfulness we must have certain
   things within us; for nothing can come out of us which is not first of
   all within us. We must begin with faith, which is the groundwork of all
   the virtues; and then diligently add to it virtue, knowledge,
   temperance, and patience. With these we must have godliness and
   brotherly love. All these put together will most assuredly cause us to
   produce, as our life fruit, the clusters of usefulness, and we shall
   not be mere idle knowers, but real doers of the Word. These holy things
   must not only be in us, but abound, or we shall be barren. Fruit is the
   overflow of life, and we must be full before we can flow over.

   We have noticed men of considerable parts and opportunities who have
   never succeeded in doing real good in the conversion of souls; and
   after close observation we have concluded that they lacked certain
   graces which are absolutely essential to fruit-bearing. For real
   usefulness, graces are better than gifts. As the man is, so is his
   work. If we would do better we must be better. Let the text be a gentle
   hint to unfruitful professors, and to myself also.

   May 28


   "And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good" Gen. 32:12

   This is the sure way of prevailing with the Lord in prayer. We may
   humbly remind Him of what He has said. Our faithful God will never run
   back from His word, nor will He leave it unfulfilled; yet He loves to
   be enquired of by His people, and put in mind of His promise. This is
   refreshing to their memories, reviving to their faith, and renewing to
   their hope. God's Word is given, not for His sake, but for ours. His
   purposes are settled, and He needs nothing to bind Him to His design of
   doing His people good; but He gives the promise for our strengthening
   and comfort. Hence He wishes us to plead it, and say to Him, "Thou
   saidst."

   "I will surely do thee good" is just the essence of all the Lord's
   gracious sayings. Lay a special stress on the word "surely." He will do
   us good, real good, lasting good, only good, every good. He will make
   us good, and this is to do us good in the very highest degree. He will
   treat us as He does his saints while we are here, and that is good. He
   will soon take us to be with Jesus and all His chosen, and that is
   supremely good. With this promise in our hearts we need not fear angry
   Esau, nor anyone else. If the Lord will do us good, who can do us hurt?

   May 29


   "And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to
   become fishers of men" Mark 1:17

   Only by coming after Jesus can we obtain our heart's desire, and be
   really useful to our fellow men. Oh, how we long to be successful
   fishers for Jesus! We would sacrifice our lives to win souls. But we
   are tempted to try methods which Jesus would never have tried. Shall we
   yield to this suggestion of the enemy? If so, we may splash the water,
   but we shall never take the fish. We must follow after Jesus if we
   would succeed. Sensational methods, entertainments, and so forth -- are
   these coming after Jesus? Can we imagine the Lord Jesus drawing a
   congregation by such means as are now commonly used? What is the result
   of such expedients? The result is nothing which Jesus will count up at
   the last great day.

   We must keep to our preaching as our Master did, for by this means
   souls are saved. We must preach our Lord's doctrine, and proclaim a
   full and free gospel; for this is the net in which souls are taken. We
   must preach with His gentleness, boldness, and love; for this is the
   secret of success with human hearts. We must work under divine
   anointing, depending upon the sacred Spirit. Thus, coming after Jesus,
   and not running before Him, nor aside from Him, we shall be fishers of
   men.

   "Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man
   sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven"
   Matt. 26:64

   Ah, Lord, thou wast in thy lowest state when before thy persecutors
   thou wast made to stand like a criminal! Yet the eyes of thy faith
   could see beyond thy present humiliation into thy future glory. What
   words are these, "Nevertheless -- hereafter"! I would imitate thy holy
   foresight, and in the midst of poverty, or sickness, or slander, I also
   would say, "Nevertheless -- hereafter." Instead of weakness, thou hast
   all power; instead of shame, all glory; instead of derision, all
   worship. Thy cross has not dimmed the splendor of thy crown, neither
   has the spittle marred the beauty of thy face. Say, rather, thou art
   the more exalted and honored because of thy sufferings.

   So, Lord, I also would take courage from the "hereafter." I would
   forget the present tribulation in the future triumph. Help thou me by
   directing me into thy Father's love and into thine own patience, so
   that when I am derided for thy name I may not be staggered, but think
   more and more of the hereafter, and, therefore, all the less of today.
   I shall be with thee soon and behold thy glory. Wherefore, I am not
   ashamed, but say in my inmost soul, "Nevertheless -- hereafter."

  "BE OF GOOD CHEER"

   "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
   overcome the world" John 16:33

   My Lord's words are true as to the tribulation. I have my share of it
   beyond all doubt. The flail is not hung up out of the way, nor can I
   hope that it will be laid aside so long as I lie upon the
   threshingfloor. How can I look to be at home in the enemy's country,
   joyful while in exile, or comfortable in a wilderness? This is not my
   rest. This is the place of the furnace, and the forge, and the hammer.
   My experience tallies with my Lord's words.

   I note how He bids me "be of good cheer." Alas! I am far too apt to be
   downcast. My spirit soon sinks when I am sorely tried. But I must not
   give way to this feeling. When my Lord bids me cheer up I must not dare
   to be cast down.

   What is the argument which He uses to encourage me? Why, it is His own
   victory. He says, "I have overcome the world." His battle was much more
   severe than mine. I have not yet resisted unto blood. Why do I despair
   of overcoming? See, my soul, the enemy has been once overcome. I fight
   with a beaten foe. O world, Jesus has already vanquished thee; and in
   me, by His grace, He will overcome thee again. Therefore am I of good
   cheer, and sing unto my conquering Lord.

  GOD'S PROMISE KEEPS

   "Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many
   days." Eccl. 11:1

   We must not expect to see an immediate reward for all the good we do;
   nor must we always confine our efforts to places and persons which seem
   likely to yield us a recompense for our labors. The Egyptian casts his
   seed upon the waters of the Nile, where it might seem a sheer waste of
   corn. But in due time the flood subsides, the rice or other grain sinks
   into the fertile mud, and rapidly a harvest is produced. Let us today
   do good to the unthankful and the evil. Let us teach the careless and
   the obstinate. Unlikely waters may cover hopeful soil. Nowhere shall
   our labor be in vain in the Lord.

   It is ours to cast our bread upon the waters; it remains with God to
   fulfill the promise, "Thou shalt find it." He will not let His promise
   fail. His good word which we have spoken shall live, shall be found,
   shall be found by us. Perhaps not just yet, but some day we shall reap
   what we have sown. We must exercise our patience; for perhaps the Lord
   may exercise it. "After many days," says the Scripture, and in many
   instances those days run into months and years, and yet the Word stands
   true. God's promise will keep; let us mind that we keep the precept,
   and keep it this day.

   "For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds
   in sunder." Nahum 1:13

   The Assyrian was allowed for a season to oppress the Lord's people, but
   there came a time for his power to be broken. So, many a heart is held
   in bondage by Satan, and frets sorely under the yoke. Oh, that to such
   prisoners of hope the word of the Lord may come at once, according to
   the text, "Now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy
   bonds in sunder"!

   See! The Lord promises a present deliverance: "Now will I break his
   yoke from off thee." Believe for immediate freedom, and according to
   thy faith so shall it be unto thee at this very hour. When God saith
   "now," let no man say "tomorrow."

   See how complete the rescue is to be; for the yoke is not to be
   removed, but broken; and the bonds are not to be untied, but burst
   asunder. Here is a display of divine force which guarantees that the
   oppressor shall not return. His yoke is broken, we cannot again be
   bowed down by its weight. His bonds are burst asunder, they can no
   longer hold us. Oh, to believe in Jesus for complete and everlasting
   emancipation! "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free
   indeed." Come, Lord, and set free thy captives, according to thy word.

   June 3

  SURE-FOOTEDNESS

   "The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hind's
   feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places." Hab. 3:19

   This confidence of the man of God is tantamount to a promise; for that
   which faith is persuaded of is the purpose of God. The prophet had to
   traverse the deep places of poverty and famine, but he went down hill
   without slipping, for the Lord gave him standing. By-and-by he was
   called to the high places of the hills of conflict; and he was no more
   afraid to go up than to go down.

   See! The Lord lent him strength. Nay, Jehovah Himself was his strength.
   Think of that: the Almighty God Himself becomes our strength!

   Note, that the Lord also gave him sure-footedness. The hinds leap over
   rock and crag, never missing their foothold. Our Lord will give us
   grace to follow the most difficult paths of duty without a stumble. He
   can fit our foot for the crags, so that we shall be at home where apart
   from God we should perish.

   One of these days we shall be called to higher places still. Up yonder
   we shall climb, even to the mount of God, the high places where the
   shining ones are gathered. Oh, what feet are the feet of faith, by
   which, following the Hind of the Morning, we shall ascend into the hill
   of the Lord!

   June 4


   "They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make
   up my jewels." Mal. 3:17

   A day is coming in which the crown jewels of our great King shall be
   counted, that it may be seen whether they answer to the inventory which
   His Father gave Him. My soul, wilt thou be among the precious things of
   Jesus? Thou art precious to Him if He is precious to thee, and thou
   shalt be His "in that day," if He is thine in this day.

   In the days of Malachi, the chosen of the Lord were accustomed so to
   converse with each other that their God Himself listened to their talk.
   He liked it so well that He took notes of it; yes, and made a book of
   it, which he lodged in His Record Office. Pleased with their
   conversation, He was also pleased with them. Pause, my soul, and ask
   thyself: If Jesus were to listen to thy talk would He be pleased with
   it? Is it to His glory and to the edification of the brotherhood? Say,
   my soul, and be sure thou sayest the truth.

   But what will the honor be for us poor creatures to be reckoned by the
   Lord to be His crown jewels! This honor have all the saints. Jesus not
   only says, "They are mine," but, "They shall be mine." He bought us,
   sought us, brought us in, and has so far wrought us to His image, that
   we shall be fought for by Him with all His might.

   June 5

  IS THERE A DIFFERENCE?

   "But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
   tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth
   put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel." Exod. 11:7

   What! Has God power over the tongues of dogs? Can he keep curs from
   barking? Yes, it is even so. He can even prevent an Egyptian dog from
   worrying one of the lambs of Israel's flock. Doth God silence dogs, and
   doggish ones among men, and the great dog at hell's gate? Then let us
   move on our way without fear.

   If He lets dogs move their tongues, yet He can stop their teeth. They
   may make a dreadful noise, and still do us no real harm. Yet, how sweet
   is quiet! How delightful to move about among enemies, and perceive that
   God maketh them to be at peace with us! Like Daniel in the den of
   lions, we are unhurt amid destroyers.

   Oh, that today, this word of the Lord to Israel might be true to me!
   Does the dog worry me? I will tell my Lord about him. Lord, he does not
   care for my pleadings; do thou speak the word of power, and he must lie
   down. Give me peace, O my God, and let me see thy hand so distinctly in
   it that I may most clearly perceive the difference which thy grace has
   made between me and the ungodly!

   June 6


   "The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer."
   Ps. 6:9

   The experience here recorded is mine. I can set to my seal that God is
   true. In very wonderful ways He has answered the prayers of His servant
   many and many a time. Yes, and He is hearing my present supplication,
   and He is not turning away His ear from me. Blessed be His holy name!

   What then? Why, for certain the promise which lies sleeping in the
   Psalmist's believing confidence is also mine. Let me grasp it by the
   hand of faith: "The Lord will receive my prayer." He will accept it,
   think of it, and grant it in the way and time which His loving wisdom
   judges to be best. I bring my poor prayer in my hand to the great King,
   and He gives me audience, and graciously receives my petition. My
   enemies will not listen to me, but my Lord will. They ridicule my
   tearful prayers, but my Lord does not; He receives my prayer into His
   ear and His heart.

   What a reception this is for a poor sinner! We receive Jesus, and then
   the Lord receives us and our prayers for His Son's sake. Blessed be
   that dear name which franks our prayers so that they freely pass even
   within the golden gates. Lord, teach me to pray, since thou hearest my
   prayers.

   June 7


   "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
   neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." John 10:28

   We believe in the eternal security of the saints. First, because they
   are Christ's, and He will never lose the sheep which He has bought with
   His blood, and received of His Father.

   Next, because He gives them eternal life, and if it be eternal, well
   then, it is eternal, and there can be no end to it, unless there can be
   an end to hell, and Heaven, and God. If spiritual life can die out, it
   is manifestly not eternal life, but temporary life. But the Lord speaks
   of eternal life, and that effectually shuts out the possibility of an
   end.

   Observe, further, that the Lord expressly says, "They shall never
   perish." As long as words have a meaning, this secures believers from
   perishing. The most obstinate unbelief cannot force this meaning out of
   this sentence.

   Then, to make the matter complete, He declares that His people are in
   His hand, and He defies all their enemies to pluck them out of it.
   Surely it is a thing impossible even for the fiend of hell. We must be
   safe in the grasp of an Almighty Saviour.

   Be it ours to dismiss carnal fear as well as carnal confidence, and
   rest peacefully in the hollow of the Redeemer's hand.

   June 8


   "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
   liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." James 1:5

   "If any of you lack wisdom." There is no "if" in the matter, for I am
   sure I lack it. What do I know? How can I guide my own way? How can I
   direct others? Lord, I am a mass of folly, and wisdom I have none.

   Thou sayest, "Let him ask of God." Lord, I now ask. Here at thy
   footstool I ask to be furnished with heavenly wisdom for this day's
   perplexities, ay, and for this day's simplicities; for I know I may do
   very stupid things, even in plain matters, unless thou dost keep me out
   of mischief.

   I thank thee that all I have to do is to ask. What grace is this on thy
   part, that I have only to pray in faith, and thou wilt give me wisdom!
   Thou dost here promise me a liberal education, and that, too, without
   an angry tutor, or a scolding usher. This, too, thou wilt bestow
   without a fee -- bestow it on a fool who lacks wisdom. O Lord, I thank
   thee for that positive and expressive word, "It shall be given him." I
   believe it. Thou wilt this day make thy babe to know the hidden wisdom
   which the carnally prudent never learn. Thou wilt guide me with thy
   counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.

   June 9


   "I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people,
   and they shall trust in the name of the Lord" Zeph. 3:12

   When true religion is ready to die out among the wealthy it finds a
   home among the poor of this world, rich in faith. The Lord has even now
   his faithful remnant. Am I one of them?

   Perhaps it is because men are afflicted and poor that they learn to
   trust in the name of the Lord. He that hath no money must try what he
   can do on trust. He whose own name is good for nothing in his own
   esteem, acts wisely to rest in another name, even that best of names,
   the name of Jehovah. God will always have a trusting people, and these
   will be an afflicted and poor people. Little as the world thinks of
   them, their being left in the midst of a nation is the channel of
   untold blessings to it. Here we have the conserving salt which keeps in
   check the corruption which is in the world through lust.

   Again the question comes home to each one of us, Am I one of them? Am I
   afflicted by the sin within me and around me? Am I poor in spirit, poor
   spiritually in my own judgment? Do I trust in the Lord? That is the
   main business. Jesus reveals the name, the character, the person of
   God; am I trusting in Him? If so, I am left in this world for a
   purpose. Lord, help me to fulfill it.

   June 10


   "They shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid" Zeph.
   3:13

   Yesterday we thought of the afflicted and poor people whom the Lord
   left to be a living seed in a dead world. The prophet says of such that
   they shall not work iniquity nor speak lies. So that while they had
   neither rank nor riches to guard them, they were also quite unable to
   use those weapons in which the wicked place so much reliance: they
   could neither defend themselves by sin nor by subtlety.

   What then? Would they be destroyed? By no means! They should both feed
   and rest, and be not merely free from danger, but even quiet from fear
   of evil. Sheep are very feeble creatures, and wolves are terrible
   enemies; yet at this hour sheep are more numerous than wolves, and the
   cause of the sheep is always winning, while the cause of the wolves is
   always declining. One day flocks of sheep will cover the plains, and
   not a wolf will be left. The fact is that sheep have a shepherd, and
   this gives them provender, protection, and peace. "None" -- which means
   not one, whether in human or diabolical form -- "shall make them
   afraid." Who shall terrify the Lord's flock when He is near? We lie
   down in green pastures, for Jesus Himself is food and rest to our
   souls.

   June 11


   "Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed" Isa. 54:4

   We shall not be ashamed of our faith. Carping critics may assail the
   Scriptures upon which we ground our belief, but every year the Lord
   will make it more and more clear that in His Book there is no error, no
   excess, and no omission. It is no discredit to be a simple believer;
   the faith which looks alone to Jesus is a crown of honor on any man's
   head, and better than a star on his breast.

   We shall not be ashamed of our hope. It shall be even as the Lord has
   said. We shall be fed, led, blest and rested. Our Lord will come, and
   then the days of our mourning shall be ended. How we shall glory in the
   Lord who first gave us lively hope, and then gave us that which we
   hoped for!

   We shall not be ashamed of our love. Jesus is to us the altogether
   lovely, and never, never, shall we have to blush because we have
   yielded our hearts to Him. The sight of our glorious Well-beloved will
   justify the most enthusiastic attachment to Him. None will blame the
   martyrs for dying for Him. When the enemies of Christ are clothed with
   everlasting contempt, the lovers of Jesus shall find themselves honored
   by all holy beings, because they chose the reproach of Christ rather
   than the treasures of Egypt.

   June 12


   "Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall
   be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew"
   Deut. 33:28

   The more we dwell alone, the more safe shall we be. God would have His
   people separate from sinners. His call to them is, "Come ye out from
   among them." A Christian world is such a monstrosity as the Scriptures
   never contemplate. A worldly Christian is spiritually diseased. Those
   who compromise with Christ's enemies may be reckoned with them.

   Our safety lies, not in making terms with the enemy but in dwelling
   alone with our best Friend. If we do this, we shall dwell in safety,
   despite the sarcasms, the slanders, and the sneers of the world. We
   shall be safe from the baleful influence of its unbelief, its pride,
   its vanity, its filthiness.

   God also will make us dwell in safety alone in that day when sin shall
   be visited on the nations by wars and famines.

   The Lord brought Abram from Ur of the Chaldees, but he stopped
   half-way. He had no blessing till, having set out to go to the land of
   Canaan, to the land of Canaan he came. He was safe alone even in the
   midst of foes. Lot was not safe in Sodom though in a circle of friends.
   Our safety is in dwelling apart with God.

   June 13


   "I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it,
   I will keep it night and day" Isa. 27:3

   When the Lord Himself speaks in His own proper person rather than
   through a prophet, the word has a peculiar weight to believing minds.
   It is Jehovah Himself who is the keeper of His own vineyard; He does
   not trust it to any other, but He makes it His own personal care. Are
   they not well kept whom God Himself keeps?

   We are to receive gracious watering, not only, every day and every
   hour, "but every moment." How we ought to grow! How fresh and fruitful
   every plant should be! What rich clusters the vines should bear!

   But disturbers come; little foxes and the boar. Therefore, the Lord
   Himself is our Guardian, and that at all hours, both "night and day."
   What, then, can harm us? Why are we afraid? He tends, He waters, He
   guards; what more do we need?

   Twice in this verse the Lord says, "I will." What truth, what power,
   what love, what immutability we find in the great "I will" of Jehovah!
   Who can resist His will? If He says "I will," what room is there for
   doubt? With an "I will" of God we can face all the hosts of sin, death,
   and hell. O Lord, since thou sayest, "I will keep thee," I reply, "I
   will praise thee!"

   June 14


   "For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake;
   because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people." I Sam. 12:22

   God's choice of His people is the reason for His abiding by them, and
   not forsaking them. He chose them for His love, and He loves them for
   His choice. His own good pleasure is the source of their election, and
   His election is the reason for the continuance of His pleasure in them.
   It would dishonor His great name for Him to forsake them, since it
   would either show that He made an error in His choice, or that He was
   fickle in His love. God's love has this glory, that it never changes,
   and this glory He will never tarnish.

   By all the memories of the Lord's former lovingkindnesses let us rest
   assured that He will not forsake us. He who has gone so far as to make
   us His people, will not undo the creation of His grace. He has not
   wrought such wonders for us that He might leave us after all. His Son
   Jesus has died for us, and we may be sure that He has not died in vain.
   Can He forsake those for whom He shed His blood? Because He has
   hitherto taken pleasure in choosing and in saving us, it will be His
   pleasure still to bless us. Our Lord Jesus is no changeable Lover.
   Having loved His own, He loves them to the end.

   June 15


   "The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of
   Jerusalem all the days of thy life" Ps. 128:5

   This is a promise to the God-fearing man who walks in the ways of
   holiness with earnest heed. He shall have domestic blessedness; his
   wife and children shall be a source of great home happiness. But then
   as a member of the church he desires to see the cause prosper, for he
   is as much concerned for the Lord's house as for his own. When the Lord
   builds our house, it is but fitting that we should desire to see the
   Lord's house builded. Our goods are not truly good unless we promote by
   them the good of the Lord's chosen church.

   Yes, you shall get a blessing when you go up to the assemblies of Zion;
   you shall be instructed, enlivened, and comforted, where prayer and
   praise ascend, and testimony is borne to the Great Sacrifice. "The Lord
   shall bless thee out of Zion."

   Nor shall you alone be profited; the church itself shall prosper;
   believers shall be multiplied, and their holy work shall be crowned
   with success. Certain gracious men have this promise fulfilled to them
   as long as they live. Alas! When they die the cause often flags. Let us
   be among those who bring good things to Jerusalem all their days. Lord,
   of thy mercy make us such! Amen.

   June 16


   "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
   abundance" Matt. 13:12

   When the Lord has given to a man much grace He will give him more. A
   little faith is a nest egg; more faith will come to it. But then it
   must not be seeming faith, but real and true. What a necessity is laid
   upon us to make sure work in religion, and not to profess much, and
   possess nothing! For one of these days the very profession will be
   taken from us, if that be all we have. The threatening is as true as
   the promise.

   Blessed be the Lord, it is His way when He has once made a beginning to
   go on bestowing the graces of His Spirit, till he who had but little,
   and yet truly had that little, is made to have abundance. Oh, for that
   abundance! Abundance of grace is a thing to be coveted. It would be
   well to know much, but better to love much. It would be delightful to
   have abundance of skill to serve God, but better still to have
   abundance of faith to trust in the Lord for skill and everything.

   Lord, since thou hast given me a sense of sin, deepen my hatred of
   evil. Since thou hast caused me to trust Jesus, raise my faith to full
   assurance. Since thou hast made me to love Thee, cause me to be carried
   away with vehement affection for Thee!

   June 17


   "For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you
   against your enemies, to save you" Deut. 20:4

   We have no enemies but the enemies of God. Our fights are not against
   men, but against spiritual wickednesses. We war with the devil, and the
   blasphemy, and error, and despair, which he brings into the field of
   battle. We fight with all the armies of sin-impurity, drunkenness,
   oppression, infidelity, and ungodliness. With these we contend
   earnestly, but not with sword or spear; the weapons of our warfare are
   not carnal.

   Jehovah, our God, abhors everything which is evil, and, therefore, He
   goeth with us to fight for us in this crusade. He will save us, and He
   will give us grace to war a good warfare, and win the victory. We may
   depend upon it that if we are on God's side God is on our side. With
   such an august ally the conflict is never in the least degree doubtful.
   It is not that truth is mighty and must prevail, but that might lies
   with the Father who is Almighty, with Jesus who has all power in Heaven
   and in earth, and with the Holy Spirit who worketh His will among men.

   Soldiers of Christ, gird on your armor. Strike home in the name of the
   God of holiness, and by faith grasp His salvation. Let not this day
   pass without striking a blow for Jesus and holiness.

   June 18


   "Now will I rise, saith the Lord; now will I be exalted; now will I
   lift up myself" Isa. 33:10

   When the spoilers had made the land as waste as if devoured by locusts,
   and the warriors who had defended the country sat down and wept like
   women, then the Lord came to the rescue. When travelers ceased from the
   roads to Zion, and Bashan and Carmel were as vineyards from which the
   fruit has failed, then the Lord arose. God is exalted in the midst of
   an afflicted people, for they seek His face and trust Him. He is still
   more exalted when in answer to their cries He lifts up Himself to
   deliver them and overthrow their enemies.

   Is it a day of sorrow with us? Let us expect to see the Lord glorified
   in our deliverance. Are we drawn out in fervent prayer? Do we cry day
   and night unto Him? Then the set time for His grace is near. God will
   lift up Himself at the right season. He will arise when it will be most
   for the display of His glory. We wish for His glory more than we long
   for our own deliverance. Let the Lord be exalted, and our chief desire
   is obtained.

   Lord, help us in such a way that we may see that thou thyself art
   working. May we magnify thee in our inmost souls. Make all around us to
   see how good and great a God thou art.

   June 19


   "Let my heart be sound in thy statutes: that I be not ashamed" Ps.
   119:80

   We may regard this inspired prayer as containing within itself the
   assurance that those who keep close to the Word of God shall never have
   cause to be ashamed of doing so.

   See, the prayer is for soundness of heart. A sound creed is good, a
   sound judgment concerning it is better, but a sound heart toward the
   truth is best of all. We must love the truth, feel the truth, and obey
   the truth, otherwise we are not truly sound in God's statutes. Are
   there many in these evil days who are sound? Oh, that the writer and
   the reader may be two of this sort!

   Many will be ashamed in the last great day, when all disputes will be
   decided. Then they will see the folly of their inventions, and be
   filled with remorse because of their proud infidelity and willful
   defiance of the Lord; but he who believed what the Lord taught, and did
   what the Lord commanded, will stand forth justified in what he did.
   Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun. Men much slandered and
   abused shall find their shame turned into glory in that day.

   Let us pray the prayer of our text, and we may be sure that its promise
   will be fulfilled to us. If the Lord makes us sound, He will keep us
   safe.

   "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
   fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
   me" Ps. 23:4

   Sweet are these words in describing a deathbed assurance. How many have
   repeated them in their last hours with intense delight!

   But the verse is equally applicable to agonies of spirit in the midst
   of life. Some of us, like Paul, die daily through a tendency to gloom
   of soul. Bunyan puts the Valley of the Shadow of Death far earlier in
   the pilgrimage than the river which rolls at the foot of the celestial
   hills. We have some of us traversed the dark and dreadful defile of
   "the shadow of death" several times, and we can bear witness that the
   Lord alone enabled us to bear up amid its wild thought, its mysterious
   horrors, its terrible depressions. The Lord has sustained us, and kept
   us above all real fear of evil, even when our spirit has been
   overwhelmed. We have been pressed and oppressed, but yet we have lived,
   for we have felt the presence of the Great Shepherd, and have been
   confident that His crook would prevent the foe from giving us any
   deadly wound.

   Should the present time be one darkened by the raven wings of a great
   sorrow, let us glorify God by a peaceful trust in Him.

  A WOMAN'S WAR

   "The Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman" Judges 4:9

   Rather an unusual text, but there may be souls in the world that may
   have faith enough to grasp it. Barak, the man, though called to the
   war, had little stomach for the fight unless Deborah would go with him,
   and so the Lord determined to make it a woman's war. By this means He
   rebuked the slackness of the man, and gained for Himself the more
   renown, and cast the more shame upon the enemies of His people.

   The Lord can still use feeble instrumentalities. Why not me? He may use
   persons who are not commonly called to great public engagements. Why
   not you? The woman who slew the enemy of Israel was no Amazon, but a
   wife who tarried in her tent. She was no orator, but a woman who milked
   the cows and made butter. May not the Lord use any one of us to
   accomplish His purpose? Somebody may come to the house today, even as
   Sisera came to Jael's tent. Be it ours, not to slay him, but to save
   him. Let us receive him with great kindness, and then bring forth the
   blessed truth of salvation by the Lord Jesus, our great Substitute, and
   press home the command, "Believe and live." Who knoweth but some
   stouthearted sinner may be slain by the gospel today?

   June 22

  HE WITH US; WE WITH HIM

   "The fear of the Lord prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked
   shall be shortened" Prov. 10:27

   There is no doubt about it. The fear of the Lord leads to virtuous
   habits, and these prevent that waste of life which comes of sin and
   vice. The holy rest which springs out of faith in the Lord Jesus also
   greatly helps a man when he is ill. Every physician rejoices to have a
   patient whose mind is fully at ease. Worry kills, but confidence in God
   is like healing medicine.

   We have therefore all the arrangements for long life, and if it be
   really for our good, we shall see a good old age, and come to our
   graves as shocks of corn in their season. Let us not be overcome with
   sudden expectation of death the moment we have a finger-ache, but let
   us rather expect that we may have to work on through a considerable
   length of days.

   And what if we should soon be called to the higher sphere? Certainly
   there would be nothing to deplore in such a summons, but everything to
   rejoice in. Living or dying we are the Lord's. If we live, Jesus will
   be with us; if we die, we shall be with Jesus.

   The truest lengthening of life is to live while we live, wasting no
   time, but using every hour for the highest ends. So be it this day.

   June 23


   "Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall
   not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it
   with shield, nor cast a bank against it" II Kings 19:32

   Neither did Sennacherib molest the city. He had boasted loudly, but he
   could not carry out his threats. The Lord is able to stop the enemies
   of His people in the very act. When the lion has the lamb between his
   jaws, the great Shepherd of the sheep can rob him of his prey. Our
   extremity only provides an opportunity for a grander display of divine
   power and wisdom.

   In the case before us, the terrible foe did not put in an appearance
   before the city which he thirsted to destroy. No annoying arrow could
   he shoot over the walls, and no besieging engines could he put to work
   to batter down the castles, and no banks could he cast up to shut in
   the inhabitants. Perhaps in our case also the Lord will prevent our
   adversaries from doing us the least harm. Certainly He can alter their
   intentions, or render their designs so abortive that they will gladly
   forego them. Let us trust in the Lord and keep His way, and He will
   take care of us. Yea, He will fill us with wondering praise as we see
   the perfection of His deliverance.

   Let us not fear the enemy till he actually come, and then let us trust
   in the Lord.

   June 24

  THE LORD'S "MUCH MORE"

   "And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
   hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man
   of God answered, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this" II
   Chron. 25:9

   If you have made a mistake, bear the loss of it; but do not act
   contrary to the will of the Lord. The Lord can give you much more than
   you are likely to lose; and if He does not, will you begin bargaining
   and chaffering with God? The king of Judah has hired an army from
   idolatrous Israel, and he was commanded to send home the fighting men
   because the Lord was not with them. He was willing to send away the
   host, only he grudged paying the hundred talents for nothing. Oh for
   shame! If the Lord will give the victory without the hirelings, surely
   it was a good bargain to pay their wages and to be rid of them.

   Be willing to lose money for conscience' sake, for peace's sake, for
   Christ's sake. Rest assured that losses for the Lord are not losses.
   Even in this life they are more than recompensed: in some cases the
   Lord prevents any loss from happening. As to our immortal life, what we
   lose for Jesus is invested in Heaven. Fret not at apparent disaster but
   listen to the whisper, "The Lord is able to give thee much more than
   this."

   June 25


   "And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye
   shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending
   upon the Son of man" John 1:51

   Yes, to our faith this sight is plain even at this day. We do see
   Heaven opened. Jesus Himself has opened that kingdom to all believers.
   We gaze into the place of mystery and glory, for He has revealed it to
   us. We shall enter it soon, for He is the way.

   Now we see the explanation of Jacob's ladder. Between earth and Heaven
   there is a holy commerce; prayer ascends, and answers come down, by the
   way of Jesus, the Mediator. We see this ladder when we see our Lord. In
   Him a stairway of light now furnishes a clear passage to the throne of
   the Most High. Let us use it, and send up by it the messengers of our
   prayers. We shall live the angelic life ourselves if we run up to
   Heaven in intercession, and lay hold upon the blessings of the
   covenant, and then descend again to scatter those gifts among the sons
   of men.

   This choice sight which Jacob only saw in a dream we will turn into a
   bright reality. This very day we will be up and down the ladder each
   hour; climbing in communion, and coming down in labor to save our
   fellow-men. This is thy promise, O Lord Jesus, let us joyfully see it
   fulfilled.

   June 26


   "Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord
   draweth nigh" James 5:8

   The last word in the Canticle of love is, "Make haste, my beloved," and
   among the last words of the Apocalypse we read, "The Spirit and the
   Bride say, Come"; to which the heavenly Bridegroom answers, "Surely I
   come quickly." Love longs for the glorious appearing of the Lord, and
   enjoys this sweet promise -- "The coming of the Lord draweth nigh."
   This stays our minds as to the future. We look out with hope through
   this window.

   This sacred "window of agate" lets in a flood of light upon the
   present, and puts us into fine condition for immediate work or
   suffering. Are we tried? Then the nearness of our joy whispers
   patience. Are we growing weary because we do not see the harvest of our
   seed-sowing? Again this glorious truth cries to us, "Be patient." Do
   our multiplied temptations cause us in the least to waver? Then the
   assurance, that before long the Lord will be here, preaches to us from
   this text, "Stablish your hearts." Be firm, be stable, be constant,
   "stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord." Soon
   will you hear the silver trumpets which announce the coming of your
   King. Be not in the least afraid. Hold the fort, for He is coming; yea,
   He may appear this very day.

   June 27

  THANK HIM; DWELL ACCEPTABLY

   "Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright
   shall dwell in thy presence" Ps. 140:13

   Oh, that my heart may be upright, that I may always be able to bless
   the name of the Lord! He is so good to those that be good, that I would
   fain be among them, and feel myself full of thankfulness every day.
   Perhaps, for a moment, the righteous are staggered when their integrity
   results in severe trial; but assuredly the day shall come when they
   shall bless their God that they did not yield to evil suggestions and
   adopt a shifty policy. In the long run true men will thank the God of
   the right for leading them by a right way. Oh, that I may be among
   them!

   What a promise is implied in this second clause, "The upright shall
   dwell in thy presence!" They shall stand accepted where others appear
   only to be condemned. They shall be the courtiers of the Great King,
   indulged with audience whensoever they desire it. They shall be favored
   ones upon whom Jehovah smiles, and with whom He graciously communes.
   Lord, I covet this high honor, this precious privilege: it will be
   Heaven on earth to me to enjoy it. Make me in all things upright, that
   I may today, and tomorrow, and every day stand in thy heavenly
   presence. Then will I give thanks unto thy name evermore. Amen.

   June 28


   "And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou
   shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent
   thee?" Judges 6:14

   What a look was that which the Lord gave to Gideon! He looked him out
   of his discouragements into a holy bravery. If our look to the Lord
   saves us, what will not His look at us do? Lord, look on me this day,
   and nerve me for its duties and conflicts.

   What a word was this which Jehovah spoke to Gideon! "Go." He must not
   hesitate. He might have answered, "What, go in all this weakness!" But
   the Lord put that word out of court by saying, "Go in this thy might."
   The Lord had looked might into him, and he had now nothing to do but to
   use it, and save Israel by smiting the Midianites. It may be that the
   Lord has more to do by me than I ever dreamed of. If He has looked upon
   me He has made me strong. Let me by faith exercise the power with which
   He has entrusted me. He never bids me "idle away my time in this my
   might." Far from it. I must "go," because He strengthens me.

   What a question is that which the Lord puts to me even as He put it to
   Gideon! "Have not I sent thee?" Yes, Lord, thou hast sent me, and I
   will go in thy strength. At thy command I go, and, going, I am assured
   that thou wilt conquer by me.

   June 29


   "Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
   things, which thou knowest not" Jer. 33:3

   God encourages us to pray. They tell us that prayer is a pious exercise
   which has no influence except upon the mind engaged in it. We know
   better. Our experience gives the lie a thousand times over to this
   infidel assertion. Here Jehovah, the living God, distinctly promises to
   answer the prayer of His servant. Let us call upon Him again, and admit
   no doubt upon the question of His hearing us and answering us. He that
   made the ear, shall He not hear? He that gave parents a love to their
   children, will He not listen to the cries of His own sons and
   daughters?

   God will answer His pleading people in their anguish. He has wonders in
   store for them. What they have never seen, heard of, or dreamed of, He
   will do for them. He will invent new blessings if needful. He will
   ransack sea and land to feed them: He will send every angel out of
   Heaven to succor them, if their distress requires it. He will astound
   us with His grace, and make us feel that it was never before done in
   this fashion. All He asks of us is that we will call upon Him. He
   cannot ask less of us. Let us cheerfully render Him our prayers at
   once.

   June 30


   "Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy
   youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant" Ezek.
   16:60

   Notwithstanding our sins, the Lord is still faithful in His love to us.
   He looks back. See how He remembers those early days of ours when He
   took us into covenant with Himself, and we gave ourselves over to Him.
   Happy days those! The Lord does not twit us with them, and charge us
   with being insincere. No, He looks rather to His covenant with us than
   to our covenant with Him. There was no hypocrisy in that sacred
   compact, on His part, at any rate. How gracious is the Lord thus to
   look back in love!

   He looks forward also. He is resolved that the covenant shall not fail.
   If we do not stand to it, He does. He solemnly declares, "I will
   establish unto thee an everlasting covenant." He has no mind to draw
   back from His promises. Blessed be His name, He sees the sacred seal,
   "the blood of the everlasting covenant," and He remembers our Surety,
   in whom He ratified that covenant, even His own dear Son; and therefore
   He rests in His covenant engagements. "He abideth faithful; he cannot
   deny himself."

   O Lord, lay this precious word upon my heart, and help me to feed upon
   it all this day!

   "God shall be with you" Gen. 48:21

   Good old Jacob could no more be with Joseph, for his hour had come to
   die: but he left his son without anxiety, for he said with confidence,
   "God shall be with you." When our dearest relations, or our most
   helpful friends, are called home by death, we must console ourselves
   with the reflection that the Lord is not departed from us, but lives
   for us, and abides with us for ever.

   If God be with us, we are in ennobling company, even though we are poor
   and despised. If God be with us, we have all-sufficient strength, for
   nothing can be too hard for the Lord. If God be with us, we are always
   safe, for none can harm those who walk under His shadow. Oh, what a joy
   we have here! Not only is God with us, but He will be with us. With us
   as individuals; with us as families; with us as churches. Is not the
   very name of Jesus, Immanuel -- God with us? Is not this the best of
   all, that God is with us? Let us be bravely diligent, and joyously
   hopeful. Our cause must prosper, the truth must win, for the Lord is
   with those who are with Him.

   All this day may this sweet word be enjoyed by every believer who turns
   to "Faith's Check Book." No greater happiness is possible.

   July 2


   "So he giveth his beloved sleep" Ps. 127:2

   Ours is not a life of anxious care, but of happy faith. Our heavenly
   Father will supply the wants of His own children, and He knoweth what
   we have need of before we ask Him. We may therefore go to our beds at
   the proper hour, and not wear ourselves out by sitting up late to plot,
   and plan, and contrive. If we have learned to rely upon our God we
   shall not lie awake with fear gnawing at our hearts; but we shall leave
   our care with the Lord, our meditation of Him shall be sweet, and He
   will give us refreshing sleep.

   To be the Lord's beloved is the highest possible honor, and he who has
   it may feel that ambition itself could desire no more, and therefore
   every selfish wish may go to sleep. What more is there even in Heaven
   than the love of God? Rest, then, O soul, for thou hast all things.

   Yet we toss to and fro unless the Lord Himself gives us not only the
   reasons for rest, but rest itself. Yea, He doth this. Jesus Himself is
   our peace, our rest, our all. On His bosom we sleep in perfect
   security, both in life and in death.


   "Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood,

   I lay me down to rest,

   As in the embraces of my God,

   Or on my Saviour's breast.

   July 3


   "He will be our guide even unto death" Ps. 48:14

   We need a guide. Sometimes we would give all that we have to be told
   exactly what to do, and where to turn. We are willing to do right, but
   we do not know which out of two roads we are to follow. Oh, for a
   guide!

   The Lord our God condescends to serve us as guide. He knows the way,
   and will pilot us along it till we reach our journey's end in peace.
   Surely we do not desire more infallible direction. Let us place
   ourselves absolutely under His guidance, and we shall never miss our
   way. Let us make Him our God and we shall find Him our guide. If we
   follow His law we shall not miss the right road of life, provided we
   first learn to lean upon Him in every step that we take.

   Our comfort is, that as He is our God for ever and ever, He will never
   cease to be with us as our guide. "Even unto death" will He lead us,
   and then we shall dwell with Him eternally, and go no more out for
   ever. This promise of divine guidance involves life-long security:
   salvation at once, guidance unto our last hour, and then endless
   blessedness. Should not each one seek this in youth, rejoice in it in
   middle life, and repose in it in old age? This day let us look up for
   guidance before we trust ourselves out of doors.

   July 4

  THE WORD, NECESSARY FOOD

   "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
   out of the mouth of God." Matt. 4:4

   If God so willed it we could live without bread, even as Jesus did for
   forty days; but we could not live without His Word. By that Word we
   were created, and by it alone can we be kept in being, for he
   sustaineth all things by the Word of His power. Bread is a second
   cause; the Lord Himself is the first source of our sustenance. He can
   work without the second cause as well as with it; and we must not tie
   Him down to one mode of operation. Let us not be too eager after the
   visible, but let us look to the invisible God. We have heard believers
   say that in deep poverty, when bread ran short, their appetites became
   short too; and to others, when common supplies failed, the Lord has
   sent in unexpected help. But we must have the Word of the Lord. With
   this alone we can withstand the devil. Take this from us, and our enemy
   will have us in his power, for we shall soon faint. Our souls need
   food, and there is none for them outside of the Word of the Lord. All
   the books and all the preachers in the world cannot furnish us a single
   meal: it is only the Word from the mouth of God that can fill the mouth
   of a believer. Lord, evermore give us this bread. We prize it above
   royal dainties.

   July 5


   "But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord; and thou shalt
   not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid." Jer.
   39:17

   When the Lord's faithful ones are suffering for Him, they shall have
   sweet messages of love from Himself, and sometimes they shall have glad
   tidings for those who sympathize with them and help them. Ebed-melech
   was only a despised Ethiopian, but he was kind to Jeremiah, and so the
   Lord sent him this special promise by the mouth of his prophet. Let us
   be ever mindful of God's persecuted servants, and He will reward us.

   Ebed-melech was to be delivered from the men whose vengeance he feared.
   He was a humble black man, but Jehovah would take care of him.
   Thousands were slain by the Chaldeans, but this lowly Negro could not
   be hurt. We, too, may be fearful of some great ones who are bitter
   against us; but if we have been faithful to the Lord's cause in the
   hour of persecution, He will be faithful to us. After all, what can a
   man do without the Lord's permission? He puts a bit into the mouth of
   rage, and a bridle upon the head of power. Let us fear the Lord, and we
   shall have no one else to fear. No cup of cold water given to a
   despised prophet of God shall be without its reward; and if we stand up
   for Jesus, Jesus will stand up for us.

   July 6

  HIS LOVE; HIS GIFT; HIS SON

   "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." John 3:16

   Of all the stars in the sky the polestar is the most useful to the
   mariner. This text is a polestar, for it has guided more souls to
   salvation than any other Scripture. It is among promises what the Great
   Bear is among constellations.

   Several words in it shine with peculiar brilliance. Here we have God's
   love, with a "so" to it, which marks its measureless greatness. Then we
   have God's gift in all its freeness and greatness. This also is God's
   Son, that unique and priceless gift of a love which could never fully
   show itself till Heaven's Only-begotten had been sent to live and die
   for men. These three points are full of light.

   Then there is the simple requirement of believing, which graciously
   points to a way of salvation suitable for guilty men. This is backed by
   a wide description -- "whosoever believeth in him." Many have found
   room in "whosoever" who would have felt themselves shut out by a
   narrower word. Then comes the great promise, that believers in Jesus
   shall not perish, but have everlasting life. This is cheering to every
   man who feels that he is ready to perish, and that he cannot save
   himself. We believe in the Lord Jesus, and we have eternal life.

   July 7


   "Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing,
   O mountains: for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have
   mercy upon his afflicted." Isa. 49:13

   So sweet are the comforts of the Lord, that not only the saints
   themselves may sing of them, but even the Heavens and the earth may
   take up the song. It takes something to make a mountain sing; and yet
   the prophet summons quite a choir of them. Lebanon, and Sirion, and the
   high hills of Bashan and Moab, He would set them all singing because of
   Jehovah's grace to His own Zion. May we not also make mountains of
   difficulty, and trial, and mystery, and labor become occasions for
   praise unto our God? "Break forth into singing, O mountains!"

   This word of promise, that our God will have mercy upon His afflicted,
   has a whole peal of bells connected with it. Hear their music --
   "Sing!" "Be joyful!" "Break forth into singing." The Lord would have
   His people happy because of His unfailing love. He would not have us
   sad and doubtful; He claims from us the worship of believing hearts. He
   cannot fail us: why should we sigh or sulk as if He would do so? Oh for
   a well-tuned harp! Oh for voices like those of the cherubim before the
   throne!

   July 8


   "The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
   delivereth them." Ps. 34:7

   We cannot see the angels, but it is enough that they can see us. There
   is one great Angel of the Covenant, whom not having seen we love, and
   His eye is always upon us both day and night. He has a host of holy
   ones under Him, and He causes these to be watchers over His saints and
   to guard them from all ill. If devils do us mischief, shining ones do
   us service. Note that the Lord of angels does not come and go, and pay
   us transient visits, but He and His armies encamp around us. The
   headquarters of the army of salvation are where those live whose trust
   is in the living God. This camp surrounds the faithful, so that they
   cannot be attacked from any quarter unless the adversary can break
   through the entrenchments of the Lord of angels. We have a fixed
   protection, a permanent watch. Sentineled by the messengers of God, we
   shall not be surprised by sudden assaults, nor swallowed up by
   overwhelming forces. Deliverance is promised in this verse --
   deliverance by the great Captain of our salvation, and that deliverance
   we shall obtain again and again until our warfare is accomplished and
   we exchange the field of conflict for the home of rest.

   July 9


   "Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell
   with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me Ps. 101:6

   If David spoke thus, we may be sure that the Son of David will be of
   the same mind. Jesus looks out for faithful men, and He fixes His eyes
   upon them, to observe them, to bring them forward, to encourage them,
   and to reward them. Let no true-hearted man think that he is
   overlooked; the King Himself has His eye upon him.

   There are two results of this royal notice. First we read, "that they
   may dwell with me." Jesus brings the faithful into His house, He sets
   them in His palace, He makes them His companions, He delights in their
   society. We must be true to our Lord, and He will then manifest Himself
   to us. When our faithfulness costs us most it will be best rewarded;
   the more furiously men reject, the more joyfully will our Lord receive
   us.

   Next, he says of the sincere man, "he shall serve me." Jesus will use
   for His own glory those who scorn the tricks of policy, and are
   faithful to Himself, His Word, and His Cross. These shall be in His
   royal retinue, the honored servants of His Majesty. Communion and
   usefulness are the wages of faithfulness. Lord make me faithful, that I
   may dwell with thee, and serve thee.

   July 10


   "Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favor her,
   yea, the set time, is come. For thy servants take pleasure in her
   stones, and favor the dust thereof." Ps. 102:13, 14

   Yes, our prayers for the church will be heard. The set time is come. We
   love the prayer meeting, and the Sunday school, and all the services of
   the Lord's house. We are bound in heart to all the people of God, and
   can truly say, "There's not a lamb in all thy flock I would disdain to
   feed; There's not a foe before whose face I'd fear thy cause to plead."

   If this is the general feeling, we shall soon enjoy times of refreshing
   from the presence of the Lord. Our assemblies will be filled, saints
   will be revived, and sinners will be converted. This can only come of
   the Lord's mercy; but it will come, and we are called upon to expect
   it. The time, the set time, is come. Let us bestir ourselves. Let us
   love every stone of our Zion, even though it may be fallen down. Let us
   treasure up the least truth, the least ordinance, the least believer,
   even though some may despise them as only so much dust. When we favor
   Zion, God is about to favor her. When we take pleasure in the Lord's
   work, the Lord Himself will take pleasure in it.

   "And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest
   thou this?" John 11:26

   Yes, Lord, we believe it; we shall never die. Our soul may be separated
   from our body, and this is death of a kind; but our soul shall never be
   separated from God, which is the true death -- the death which was
   threatened to sin -- the death penalty which is the worst that can
   happen. We believe this most assuredly, for who shall separate us from
   the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord? We are members of
   the Body of Christ; will Christ lose parts of His body? We are married
   to Jesus; will He be bereaved and widowed? It is not possible. There is
   a life within us which is not capable of being divided from God: yea,
   and the Holy Spirit dwells within us, and how then can we die? Jesus,
   Himself, is our life, and therefore there is no dying for us, for He
   cannot die again. In Him we died unto sin once, and the capital
   sentence cannot a second time be executed. Now we live, and live for
   ever. The reward of righteousness is life everlasting, and we have
   nothing less than the righteousness of God, and therefore can claim the
   very highest reward.

   Living and believing, we believe that we shall live and enjoy.
   Wherefore we press forward with full assurance that our life is secure
   in our living Head.

  WHOM, WHEN, HOW TO DELIVER

   "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
   reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished." II Peter
   2:9

   The godly are tempted and tried. That is not true faith which is never
   put to the test. But the godly are delivered out of their trials, and
   that not by chance, nor by secondary agencies, but by the Lord himself.
   He personally undertakes the office of delivering those who trust Him.
   God loves the godly or godlike, and He makes a point of knowing where
   they are, and how they fare.

   Sometimes their way seems to be a labyrinth, and they cannot imagine
   how they are to escape from threatening danger. What they do not know
   their Lord knows. He knows whom to deliver, and when to deliver, and
   how to deliver. He delivers in the way which is most beneficial to the
   godly, most crushing to the tempter, and most glorifying to Himself. We
   may leave the "how" with the Lord, and be content to rejoice in the
   fact that He will, in some way or other, bring His own people through
   all the dangers, trials, and temptations of this mortal life, to His
   own right hand in glory.

   This day it is not for me to pry into my Lord's secrets, but patiently
   to wait his time, knowing this, that though I know nothing, my heavenly
   Father knows.

   July 13


   "For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword,
   but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy
   trust in me, saith the Lord." Jer. 39:18

   Behold the protecting power of trust in God. The great men of Jerusalem
   fell by the sword, but poor Ebed-melech was secure, for his confidence
   was in Jehovah. Where else should a man trust but in his Maker? We are
   foolish when we prefer the creature to the Creator. Oh, that we could
   in all things live by faith, then should we be delivered in all time of
   danger! No one ever did trust in the Lord in vain, and no one ever
   shall.

   The Lord saith, "I will surely deliver thee." Mark the divine "surely."
   Whatever else may be uncertain, God's care of believers is sure. God
   Himself is the guardian of the gracious. Under His sacred wing there is
   safety even when every danger is abroad. Can we accept this promise as
   sure? Then in our present emergency we shall find that it stands fast.
   We hope to be delivered because we have friends, or because we are
   prudent, or because we can see hopeful signs; but none of these things
   are one half so good as God's simple "because thou hast put thy trust
   in me." Dear reader, try this way, and, trying it, you will keep to it
   all your life. It is as sweet as it is sure.

   July 14


   "Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall
   never suffer the righteous to be moved." Ps. 55:22

   It is a heavy burden, roll it on Omnipotence. It is thy burden now, and
   it crushes thee; but when the Lord takes it, He will make nothing of
   it. If thou art called still to bear it, "he will sustain thee." It
   will be on Him, and not on thee. Thou wilt be so upheld under it that
   the burden will be a blessing. Bring the Lord into the matter and thou
   wilt stand upright under that which in itself would bow thee down.

   Our worst fear is lest our trial should drive us from the path of duty;
   but this the Lord will never suffer. If we are righteous before Him, He
   will not endure that our affliction should move us from our standing.
   In Jesus He accepts us as righteous, and in Jesus He will keep us so.

   What about the present moment? Art thou going forth to this day's trial
   alone? Are thy poor shoulders again to be galled with the oppressive
   load? Be not so foolish. Tell the Lord all about thy grief, and leave
   it with Him. Don't cast your burden down, and then take it up again;
   but roll it on the Lord, and leave it there. Then shalt thou walk at
   large, a joyful and unburdened believer, singing the praises of thy
   great Burden-bearer.

   July 15


   "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted." Matt. 5:4

   By the valley of weeping we come to Zion. One would have thought
   mourning and being blessed were in opposition, but the infinitely wise
   Saviour puts them together, in this beatitude. What He has joined
   together let no man put asunder. Mourning for sin -- our own sins, and
   the sins of others -- is the Lord's seal set upon His faithful ones.
   When the Spirit of grace is poured upon the house of David, or any
   other house, they shall mourn. By holy mourning we receive the best of
   our blessings, even as the rarest commodities come to us by water. Not
   only shall the mourner be blessed at some future day, but Christ
   pronounces him blessed even now.

   The Holy Spirit will surely comfort those hearts which mourn for sin.
   They shall be comforted by the application of the blood of Jesus, and
   by the cleansing power of the Holy Ghost. They shall be comforted as to
   the abounding sin of their city and of their age by the assurance that
   God will glorify Himself, however much men may rebel against Him. They
   shall be comforted with the expectation that they shall be wholly freed
   from sin before long, and shall soon be taken up to dwell for ever in
   the glorious presence of their Lord.

   "I will save her that halteth." Zeph. 3:19

   There are plenty of these lame ones, both male and female. You may meet
   "her that halteth" twenty times in an hour. They are in the right road,
   and exceedingly anxious to run in it with diligence, but they are lame,
   and make a sorry walk of it. On the heavenly road there are many
   cripples. It may be that they say in their hearts -- What will become
   of us? Sin will overtake us, Satan will throw us down. Ready-to-halt is
   our name and our nature; the Lord can never make good soldiers of us,
   nor even nimble messengers to go on His errands. Well, well! He will
   save us, and that is no small thing. He says, "I will save her that
   halteth." In saving us He will greatly glorify Himself. Everybody will
   ask -- How came this lame woman to run the race and win the crown? And
   then the praise will all be given to almighty grace.

   Lord, though I halt in faith, in prayer, in praise, in service, and in
   patience, save me, I beseech thee! Only thou canst save such a cripple
   as I am. Lord, let me not perish because I am among the hindmost, but
   gather up by thy grace the slowest of thy pilgrims -- even me. Behold
   He hath said it shall be so, and therefore, like Jacob, prevailing in
   prayer, I go forward though my sinew be shrunk.

   July 17


   "The people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits."
   Dan. 11:32

   "The Lord is a man of war, Jehovah is his name." Those who enlist under
   His banner shall have a Commander who will train them for the conflict,
   and give them both vigor and valor. The times of which Daniel wrote
   were of the very worst kind, and then it was promised that the people
   of God would come out in their best colors: they would be strong and
   stout to confront the powerful adversary.

   Oh, that we may know our God; His power, His faithfulness, His
   immutable love, and so may be ready to risk everything in His behalf.
   He is One whose character excites our enthusiasm, and makes us willing
   to live and to die for Him. Oh, that we may know our God by familiar
   fellowship with Him; for then we shall become like Him, and shall be
   prepared to stand up for truth and righteousness. He who comes forth
   fresh from beholding the face of God will never fear the face of man.
   If we dwell with Him, we shall catch the heroic spirit, and to us a
   world of enemies will be but as the drop of a bucket. A countless array
   of men, or even of devils, will seem as little to us as the nations are
   to God, and He counts them only as grasshoppers. Oh, to be valiant for
   truth in this day of falsehood.

   July 18


   "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak
   comfortably unto her." Hosea 2:14

   The goodness of God sees us allured by sin, and it resolves to try upon
   us the more powerful allurements of love. Do we not remember when the
   Lover of our souls first cast a spell upon us and charmed us away from
   the fascinations of the world? He will do this again and again whenever
   He sees us likely to be ensnared by evil.

   He promises to draw us apart, for there He can best deal with us, and
   this separated place is not to be a Paradise, but a wilderness, since
   in such a place there will be nothing to take off our attention from
   our God. In the deserts of affliction the presence of the Lord becomes
   everything to us, and we prize His company beyond any value which we
   set upon it when we sat under our own vine and fig-tree in the society
   of our fellows. Solitude and affliction bring more to themselves and to
   their heavenly Father than any other means.

   When thus allured and secluded the Lord has choice things to say to us
   for our comfort. He "speaks to our heart," as the original has it. Oh,
   that at this we may have this promise explained in our experience!
   Allured by love, separated by trial, and comforted by the Spirit of
   truth, may we know the Lord and sing for joy!

   July 19


   "Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy
   strength be." Deut. 33:25

   Here are two things provided for the pilgrim: shoes and strength.

   As for the shoes: they are very needful for traveling along rough ways,
   and for trampling upon deadly foes. We shall not go barefoot -- this
   would not be suitable for princes of the blood royal. Our shoes shall
   not be at all of the common sort, for they shall have soles of durable
   metal, which will not wear out even if the journey be long and
   difficult. We shall have protection proportionate to the necessities of
   the road and the battle. Wherefore let us march boldly on, fearing no
   harm even though we tread on serpents, or set our foot upon the dragon
   himself.

   As for the strength: it shall be continued as long as our days shall
   continue, and it shall be proportioned to the stress and burden of
   those days. The words are few, "as thy days thy strength," but the
   meaning is full. This day we may look for trial, and for work which
   will require energy, but we may just as confidently look for equal
   strength. This word given to Asher is given to us also who have faith
   wherewith to appropriate it. Let us rise to the holy boldness which it
   is calculated to create within the believing heart.

   July 20


   "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
   sin unto salvation." Heb. 9:28

   This is our hope. He to whom we have already looked as coming once to
   bear the sins of many will have another manifestation to the sons of
   men; this is a happy prospect in itself. But that second appearing has
   certain peculiar marks which glorify it exceedingly.

   Our Lord will have ended the business of sin. He has so taken it away
   from His people, and so effectually borne its penalty, that He will
   have nothing to do with it at His second coming. He will present no
   sin-offering, for He will have utterly put sin away.

   Our Lord will then complete the salvation of His people. They will be
   finally and perfectly saved, and will in every respect enjoy the
   fullness of that salvation. He comes not to bear the result of our
   transgressions, but to bring the result of His obedience; not to remove
   our condemnation, but to perfect our salvation.

   Our Lord thus appears only to those who look for Him. He will not be
   seen in this character by men whose eyes are blinded with self and sin.
   To them He will be a terrible Judge, and nothing more. We must first
   look to Him, and then look for Him; and in both cases our look shall be
   life.

   July 21


   "And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
   and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
   ever." Dan. 12:3

   Here is something to wake me up. This is worth living for. To be wise
   is a noble thing in itself: in this place it refers to a divine wisdom
   which only the Lord Himself can bestow. Oh to know myself, my God, my
   Saviour! May I be so divinely taught that I may carry into practice
   heavenly truth, and live in the light of it! Is my life a wise one? Am
   I seeking that which I ought to seek? Am I living as I shall wish I had
   lived when I come to die? Only such wisdom can secure for me eternal
   brightness as of yonder sunlit skies.

   To be a winner of souls is a glorious attainment. I had need be wise if
   I am to turn even one to righteousness; much more if I am to turn many.
   Oh for the knowledge of God, of men, of the Word, and of Christ, which
   will enable me to convert my fellowmen, and to convert large numbers of
   them! I would give myself to this, and never rest till I accomplish it.
   This will be better than winning stars at court. This will make me a
   star, a shining star, a star shining for ever and ever; yea more, it
   will make me shine as many stars. My soul, arouse thyself! Lord,
   quicken me!

   July 22


   "And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee
   unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and
   in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou
   shalt know the Lord." Hosea 2:19,20

   Betrothment unto the Lord! What an honor and a joy! My soul, is Jesus
   indeed thine by His own condescending betrothal? Then, mark, it is for
   ever. He will never break His engagement, much less sue out a divorce
   against a soul joined to Himself in marriage bonds.

   Three times the Lord says, "I will betroth thee." What words He heaps
   together to set forth the betrothal! Righteousness comes in to make the
   covenant legal; none can forbid these lawful banns. Judgment sanctions
   the alliance with its decree: none can see folly or error in the match.
   Lovingkindness warrants that this is a love union, for without love
   betrothal is bondage, and not blessedness. Meanwhile, mercy smiles, and
   even sings; yea, she multiplies herself into "mercies," because of the
   abounding grace of this holy union.

   Faithfulness is the registrar, and records the marriage, and the Holy
   Spirit says "Amen" to it, as He promises to teach the betrothed heart
   all the sacred knowledge needful for its high destiny. What a promise!

   July 23


   "And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." Heb. 10:17

   According to this gracious covenant the Lord treats His people as if
   they had never sinned. Practically, He forgets all their trespasses.
   Sins of all kinds He treats as if they had never been; as if they were
   quite erased from His memory. O miracle of grace! God here doth that
   which in certain aspects is impossible to Him. His mercy worketh
   miracles which far transcend all other miracles.

   Our God ignores our sin now that the sacrifice of Jesus has ratified
   the covenant. We may rejoice in Him without fear that He will be
   provoked to anger against us because of our iniquities. See! He puts us
   among the children; He accepts us as righteous; He takes delight in us
   as if we were perfectly holy. He even puts us into places of trust;
   makes us guardians of His honor, trustees of the crown jewels, stewards
   of the gospel. He counts us worthy, and gives us a ministry; this is
   the highest and most special proof that He does not remember our sins.
   Even when we forgive an enemy, we are very slow to trust him; we judge
   it to be imprudent so to do. But the Lord forgets our sins, and treats
   us as if we had never erred. O my soul, what a promise is this! Believe
   it and be happy.

   July 24


   "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment." Rev.
   3:5

   Warrior of the cross, fight on! Never rest till thy victory is
   complete, for thine eternal reward will prove worthy of a life of
   warfare.

   See, here is perfect purity for thee! A few in Sardis kept their
   garments undefiled, and their recompense is to be spotless. Perfect
   holiness is the prize of our high calling, let us not miss it.

   See, here is joy! Thou shalt wear holiday robes, such as men put on at
   wedding feasts; thou shalt be clothed with gladness, and be made bright
   with rejoicing. Painful struggles shall end in peace of conscience, and
   joy in the Lord.

   See, here is victory! Thou shalt have thy triumph. Palm, and crown, and
   white robe shall be thy guerdon; thou shalt be treated as a conqueror,
   and owned as such by the Lord Himself.

   See, here is priestly array! Thou shalt stand before the Lord in such
   raiment as the sons of Aaron wore; thou shalt offer the sacrifices of
   thanksgiving, and draw near unto the Lord with the incense of praise.

   Who would not fight for a Lord who gives such large honors to the very
   least of His faithful servants? Who would not be clothed in a fool's
   coat for Christ's sake, seeing He will robe us with glory?

   July 25


   "But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in
   thy lot at the end of the days." Dan. 12:13

   We cannot understand all the prophecies, but yet we regard them with
   pleasure, and not with dismay. There can be nothing in the Father's
   decree which should justly alarm His child. Though the abomination of
   desolation be set up, yet the true believer shall not be defiled;
   rather shall he be purified, and made white, and tried. Though the
   earth be burned up, no smell of fire shall come upon the chosen. Amid
   the crash of matter, and the wreck of worlds, the Lord Jehovah will
   preserve His own.

   Calmly resolute in duty, brave in conflict, patient in suffering, let
   us go our way, keeping to our road, and neither swerving from it nor
   loitering in it. The end will come; let us go our way till it does.

   Rest will be ours. All other things swing to and fro, but our
   foundation standeth sure. God rests in His love, and, therefore, we
   rest in it. Our peace is, and ever shall be, like a river. A lot in the
   heavenly Canaan is ours, and we shall stand in it, come what may. The
   God of Daniel will give a worthy portion to all who dare to be decided
   for truth and holiness as Daniel was. No den of lions shall deprive us
   of our sure inheritance.

   July 26


   "And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me
   Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali; for I will take away the names
   of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by
   their name." Hosea 2:16, 17

   That day has come. We view our God no more as Baal, our tyrant lord and
   mighty master, for we are not under law, but under grace. We now think
   of Jehovah, our God, as our Ishi, our beloved husband, our lord in
   love, our next-of-kin in bonds of sacred relationship. We do not
   reverence Him less, but we love Him more. We do not serve Him less
   obediently, but we serve Him for a higher and more endearing reason. We
   no longer tremble under His lash, but rejoice in His love. The slave is
   changed into a child, and the task into a pleasure.

   Is it so with thee, dear reader? Has grace cast out slavish fear and
   implanted filial love? How happy are we in such an experience! Now we
   call the Lord's Day a delight, and worship is never a weariness. Prayer
   is now a privilege, and praise is a holiday. To obey is Heaven; to give
   to the cause of God is a banquet. Thus have all things become new. Our
   mouth is filled with singing, and our heart with music. Blessed be our
   heavenly Ishi for ever and for ever.

   July 27


   "I will give you the sure mercies of David." Acts 13:34

   Nothing of man is sure; but everything of God is so. Especially are
   covenant mercies sure mercies, even as David said "an everlasting
   covenant, ordered in all things and sure."

   We are sure that the Lord meant His mercy. He did not speak mere words:
   there is substance and truth in every one of His promises. His mercies
   are mercies indeed. Even if a promise seems as if it must drop through
   by reason of death, yet it never shall, for the good Lord will make
   good His word.

   We are sure that the Lord will bestow promised mercies on all His
   covenanted ones. They shall come in due course to all the chosen of the
   Lord. They are sure to all the seed, from the least of them unto the
   greatest of them.

   We are sure that the Lord will continue His mercies to His own people.
   He does not give and take. What He has granted us is the token of much
   more. That which we have not yet received is as sure as that which has
   already come; therefore, let us wait before the Lord and be still.
   There is no justifiable reason for the least doubt. God's love, and
   word, and faithfulness are sure. Many things are questionable, but of
   the Lord we sing--"For his mercies shall endure ever faithful, ever
   sure.

   July 28

  BOW DOWN; BE LIFTED UP

   "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may
   exalt you in due time." I Peter 5:6

   This is tantamount to a promise: if we will bow down, the Lord will
   lift us up. Humility leads to honor: submission is the way to
   exaltation. That same hand of God which presses us down is waiting to
   raise us up when we are prepared to bear the blessing. We stoop to
   conquer. Many cringe before men, and yet miss the patronage they crave;
   but he that humbles himself under the hand of God shall not fail to be
   enriched, uplifted, sustained, and comforted by the ever-gracious One.
   It is a habit of Jehovah to cast down the proud, and lift up the lowly.

   Yet there is a time for the Lord's working. We ought now to humble
   ourselves, even at this present moment; and we are bound to keep on
   doing so whether the Lord lays His afflicting hand upon us or not. When
   the Lord smites, it is our special duty to accept the chastisement with
   profound submission. But as for the Lord's exaltation of us, that can
   only come "in due time," and God is the best judge of that day and
   hour. Do we cry out impatiently for the blessing? Would we wish for
   untimely honor? What are we at? Surely we are not truly humbled, or we
   should wait with quiet submission. So let us do.

   July 29


   "He hath cast out thine enemy." Zeph. 3:15

   What a casting out was that! Satan has lost his throne in our nature
   even as he lost his seat in Heaven. Our Lord Jesus has destroyed the
   enemy's reigning power over us. He may worry us, but he cannot claim us
   as his own. His bonds are no longer upon our spirits: the Son has made
   us free, and we are free indeed.

   Still is the arch-enemy the accuser of the brethren; but even from this
   position our Lord has driven him. Our advocate silences our accuser.
   The Lord rebukes our enemies, and pleads the causes of our soul, so
   that no harm comes of all the devil's revilings.

   As a tempter, the evil spirit still assails us, and insinuates himself
   into our minds; but thence also is he cast out as to his former
   preeminence. He wriggles about like a serpent, but he cannot rule like
   a sovereign. He hurls in blasphemous thoughts when he has opportunity;
   but what a relief it is when he is told to be quiet, and is made to
   slink off like a whipped cur! Lord, do this for any who are at this
   time worried and wearied by his barkings. Cast out their enemy, and be
   thou glorious in their eyes. Thou hast cast him down, Lord cast him
   out. Oh, that thou wouldst banish him from the world!

   July 30


   "I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice." John 16:22

   Surely He will come a second time, and then, when He sees us, and we
   see Him, there will be rejoicings indeed. Oh for that joyous return!

   But this promise is being daily fulfilled in another sense. Our
   gracious Lord has many "agains" in His dealings with us. He gave us
   pardon, and He sees us again, and repeats the absolving word as fresh
   sins cause us grief. He has revealed to us our acceptance before God,
   and when our faith in that blessing grows a little dim, He comes to us
   again and again, and says, "Peace be unto you"; and our hearts are
   glad.

   Beloved, all our past mercies are tokens of future mercies. If Jesus
   has been with us, He will see us again. Look upon no former favor as a
   dead and buried thing, to be mourned over; but regard it as a seed
   sown, which will grow, and push its head up from the dust, and cry, "I
   will see you again." Are the times dark because Jesus is not with us as
   he used to be? Let us pluck up courage; for He will not be long away.
   His feet are as those of a roe or young hart, and they will soon bring
   Him to us. Wherefore let us begin to be joyous, since He saith to us
   even now, "I will see you again."

   July 31

  AN APPEAL; DELIVERANCE

   "And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou
   shalt glorify me." Ps. 50:15

   This is a promise indeed!

   Here is an urgent occasion -- "the day of trouble." It is dark at noon
   on such a day, and every hour seems blacker than the one which came
   before it. Then is this promise in season: it is written for the cloudy
   day.

   Here is condescending advice, "call upon me." We ought not to need the
   exhortation: it should be our constant habit all the day and every day.
   What a mercy to have liberty to call upon God! What wisdom to make good
   use of it! How foolish to go running about to men! The Lord invites us
   to lay our case before Him, and surely we will not hesitate to do so.

   Here is reassuring encouragement: "I will deliver thee." Whatever the
   trouble may be, the Lord makes no exceptions, but promises full, sure,
   happy deliverance. He will Himself work out our deliverance by His own
   hand. We believe it, and the Lord honors faith.

   Here is an ultimate result: "Thou shalt glorify me. Ah! that we will do
   most abundantly. When He has delivered us we will loudly praise Him;
   and as He is sure to do it, let us begin to glorify Him at once.

   "And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
   after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
   God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee" Gen. 17:7

   O Lord, thou hast made a covenant with me, thy servant, in Christ Jesus
   my Lord; and now, I beseech thee, let my children be included in its
   gracious provisions. Permit me to believe this promise as made to me as
   well as to Abraham. I know, that my children are born in sin, and
   shapen in iniquity, even as those of other men; therefore, I ask
   nothing on the ground of their birth, for well I know that "that which
   is born of the flesh is flesh," and nothing more. Lord, make them to be
   born under thy covenant of grace by thy Holy Spirit!

   I pray for my descendants throughout all generations. Be thou their God
   as thou art mine. My highest honor is that thou hast permitted me to
   serve thee; may my offspring serve thee in all years to come. O God of
   Abraham, be the God of his Isaac! O God of Hannah, accept her Samuel!

   If, Lord, thou hast favored me in my family, I pray thee remember other
   households of thy people which remain unblest. Be the God of all the
   families of Israel. Let not one of those who fear thy name be tried
   with a godless and wicked household, for thy Son Jesus Christ's sake.
   Amen.

   "Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what
   thou shalt say" Exod. 4:12

   Many a true servant of the Lord is slow of speech, and when called upon
   to plead for his Lord, he is in great confusion lest he should spoil a
   good cause by his bad advocacy. In such a case it is well to remember
   that the Lord made the tongue which is so slow, and we must take care
   that we do not blame our Maker. It may be that a slow tongue is not so
   great an evil as a fast one, and fewness of words may be more of a
   blessing than floods of verbiage. It is also quite certain that real
   saving power does not lie in human rhetoric, with its tropes, and
   pretty phrases, and grand displays. Lack of fluency is not so great a
   lack as it looks.

   If God be with our mouth, and with our mind, we shall have something
   better than the sounding brass of eloquence, or the tinkling cymbal of
   persuasion. God's teaching is wisdom; His presence is power. Pharaoh
   had more reason to be afraid of stammering Moses than of the most
   fluent talker in Egypt; for what he said had power in it; he spoke
   plagues and deaths. If the Lord be with us in our natural weakness we
   shall be girt with supernatural power. Therefore, let us speak for
   Jesus boldly, as we ought to speak.

   "But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and
   he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat" Lev. 22:11

   Strangers, sojourners, and servants upon hire were not to eat of holy
   things. It is so in spiritual matters still. But two classes were free
   at the sacred table, those who were bought with the priest's money, and
   those who were born into the priest's house. Bought and born, these
   were the two indisputable proofs of a right to holy things.

   Bought. Our great High Priest has bought with a price all those who put
   their trust in Him. They are His absolute property -- altogether the
   Lord's. Not for what they are in themselves, but for their owner's sake
   they are admitted into the same privileges which He Himself enjoys, and
   "they shall eat of his meat." He has meat to eat which worldlings know
   not of. "Because ye belong to Christ," therefore shall ye share with
   your Lord.

   Born. This an equally sure way to privilege; if born in the Priest's
   house we take our place with the rest of the family. Regeneration makes
   us fellow-heirs, and of the same body; and, therefore, the peace, the
   joy, the glory, which the Father has given to Christ, Christ has given
   to us. Redemption and regeneration have given us a double claim to the
   divine permit of this promise.

   Aug. 4


   "The Lord bless thee, and keep thee" Num. 6:24

   This first clause of the high-priest's benediction is substantially a
   promise. That blessing which our great High Priest pronounces upon us
   is sure to come, for He speaks the mind of God.

   What a joy to abide under the divine blessing! This puts a gracious
   flavor into all things. If we are blessed, then all our possessions and
   enjoyments are blessed; yea, our losses and crosses, and even our
   disappointments are blessed. God's blessing is deep, emphatic,
   effectual. A man's blessing may begin and end in words; but the
   blessing of the Lord makes rich and sanctifies. The best wish we can
   have for our dearest friend is not "May prosperity attend thee," but
   "The Lord bless thee."

   It is equally a delightful thing to be kept of God; kept by Him, kept
   near Him, kept in Him. They are kept indeed whom God keeps; they are
   preserved from evil, they are reserved unto boundless happiness. God's
   keeping goes with His blessing, to establish it and cause it to endure.

   The author of this little book desires that the rich blessing and sure
   keeping here pronounced may come upon every reader who may at this
   moment be looking at these lines. Please breathe the text to God as a
   prayer for His servants.

   "The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide" Ps.
   37:31

   Put the law into the heart, and the whole man is right. This is where
   the law should be; for then it lies, like the tables of stone in the
   ark, in the place appointed for it. In the head it puzzles, on the back
   it burdens, in the heart it upholds.

   What a choice word is here used, "the law of his God!" When we know the
   Lord as our own God His law becomes liberty to us. God with us in
   covenant makes us eager to obey His will and walk in His commands. Is
   the precept my Father's precept? Then I delight in it.

   We are here guaranteed that obedient-hearted man shall be sustained in
   every step that he takes. He will do that which is right, and he shall
   therefore do that which is wise. Holy action is always the most
   prudent, though it may not at the time seem to be so. We are moving
   along the great highroad of God's providence and grace when we keep to
   the way of His law. The Word of God has never misled a single soul yet;
   its plain directions to walk humbly, justly, lovingly, and in the fear
   of the Lord, are as much words of wisdom to make our way prosperous as
   rules of holiness to keep our garments clean. He walks surely who walks
   righteously.

  GO; TAKE YOUR PROPERTY

   "Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and
   possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear
   not, neither be discouraged" Deut. 1:21

   There is a heritage of grace which we ought to be bold enough to win
   for our own possession. All that one believer has gained is free to
   another. We may be strong in faith, fervent in love, and abundant in
   labor; there is nothing to prevent it; let us go up and take
   possession. The sweetest experience and the brightest grace are as much
   for us as for any of our brethren, Jehovah has set it before us; no one
   can deny our right; let us go up and possess it in His name.

   The world also lies before us to be conquered for the Lord Jesus. We
   are not to leave any country or corner of it unsubdued. That slum near
   our house is before us, not to baffle our endeavors, but to yield to
   them. We have only to summon courage enough to go forward, and we shall
   win dark homes and hard hearts for Jesus. Let us never leave the people
   in a lane or alley to die because we have not enough faith in Jesus and
   His gospel to go up and possess the land. No spot is too benighted, no
   person so profane as to be beyond the power of grace. Cowardice,
   begone! Faith marches to the conquest.

   Aug. 7


   "Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to
   do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:
   turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest
   prosper whithersoever thou goest" Josh. 1:7

   Yes, the Lord will be with us in our holy war, but He demands of us
   that we strictly follow His rules. Our victories will very much depend
   upon our obeying Him with all our heart, throwing strength and courage
   into the actions of our faith. If we are halfhearted we cannot expect
   more than half a blessing.

   We must obey the Lord with care and thoughtfulness. "Observe to do" is
   the phrase used, and it is full of meaning. This is referred to every
   part of the divine will; we must obey with universal readiness. Our
   rule of conduct is "according to all the law." We may not pick and
   choose, but we must take the Lord's commands as they come, one and all.
   In all this we must go on with exactness and constancy. Ours is to be a
   straightforward course, which bends neither to the right nor to the
   left. We are not to err by being more rigid than the law, nor turn out
   of levity to a more free and easy way. With such obedience there will
   come spiritual prosperity. O Lord, help us to see if it be not even so!
   We shall not test thy promise in vain.

   Aug. 8


   "The Lord God will help me" Isa. 50:7

   These are in prophecy the words of Messiah in the day of His obedience
   unto death, when He gave His back to the smiters, and His cheeks to
   them that plucked off the hair. He was confident in divine support, and
   trusted in Jehovah.

   O my soul, thy sorrows are as the small dust of the balance compared
   with thy Lord's! Canst thou not believe that the Lord God will help
   thee? Thy Lord was in a peculiar position; for as the representative of
   sinful men -- their substitute and sacrifice -- it was needful that the
   Father should leave Him, and cause Him to come under desertion of soul.
   No such necessity is laid upon thee: thou are not bound to cry, "Why
   hast thou forsaken me?" Did thy Saviour even in such a case still rely
   upon God, and canst not thou? He died for thee, and thus made it
   impossible that thou shouldst be left alone; wherefore, be of good
   cheer.

   In this day's labors or trials say, "The Lord God will help me." Go
   forth boldly. Set your face like a flint, and resolve that no faintness
   or shamefacedness shall come near you. If God helps, who can hinder? If
   you are sure of omnipotent aid, what can be too heavy for you? Begin
   the day joyously, and let no shade of doubt come between thee and the
   eternal sunshine.

  PRUNING FOR FRUIT-BEARING

   "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every
   branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more
   fruit" John 15:2

   This is a precious promise to one who lives for fruitfulness. At first
   it seems to wear a sharp aspect. Must the fruitful bough be pruned?
   Must the knife cut even the best and most useful? No doubt it is so,
   for very much of our Lord's purging work is done by means of
   afflictions of one kind or another. It is not the evil but the good who
   have the promise of tribulation in this life. But, then, the end makes
   more than full amends for the painful nature of the means. If we may
   bring forth more fruit for our Lord, we will not mind the pruning and
   the loss of leafage.

   Still, purging is sometimes wrought by the Word apart from trial, and
   this takes away whatever appeared rough in the flavor of the promise.
   We shall by the Word be made more gracious and more useful. The Lord,
   who has made us, in a measure, fruit-bearing, will operate upon us till
   we reach a far higher degree of fertility. Is not this a great joy?
   Truly there is more comfort in a promise of fruitfulness than if we had
   been warranted riches, or health, or honor.

   Lord Jesus, speedily fulfill thy gracious word to me, and cause me to
   abound in fruit to thy praise!

   Aug. 10


   "The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth
   up" I Sam 2:7

   All my changes come from Him who never changes. If I had grown rich, I
   should have seen His hand in it, and I should have praised Him; let me
   equally see His hand if I am made poor, and let me as heartily praise
   Him. When we go down in the world, it is of the Lord, and so we may
   take it patiently: when we rise in the world, it is of the Lord, and we
   may accept it thankfully. In any case, the Lord hath done it, and it is
   well.

   It seems that Jehovah's way is to lower those whom He means to raise,
   and to strip those whom He intends to clothe. If it is His way, it is
   the wisest and best way. If I am now enduring the bringing low I may
   well rejoice, because I see in it the preface to the lifting up. The
   more we are humbled by grace, the more we shall be exalted in glory.
   That impoverishment which will be overruled for our enrichment is to be
   welcomed.

   O Lord, thou has taken me down of late, and made me feel my
   insignificance and sin. It is not a pleasant experience, but I pray
   thee make it a profitable one to me. Oh, that thou wouldst thus fit me
   to bear a greater weight of delight and of usefulness; and when I am
   ready for it, then grant it to me, for Christ's sake! Amen.

   Aug. 11

  WAITING, NOT RUNNING

   "Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation" Ps. 62:1

   Blessed posture! -- waiting truly and only upon the Lord. Be this our
   condition all this day, and every day. Waiting His leisure, waiting in
   His service, waiting in joyful expectation, waiting in prayer, and
   content. When the very soul thus waits, it is in the best and truest
   condition of a creature before his Creator, a servant before his
   Master, a child before his Father. We allow no dictation to God, nor
   complaining of Him; we will permit no petulance, and no distrust. At
   the same time, we practice no running before the cloud, and no seeking
   to others for aid: neither of these would be waiting upon God. God, and
   God alone, is the expectation of our hearts.

   Blessed assurance! -- from Him salvation is coming; it is on the road.
   It will come from Him, and from no one else. He shall have all the
   glory of it, for He alone can and will perform it. And He will perform
   it most surely in His own time and manner. He will save from doubt, and
   suffering, and slander, and distress. Though we see no sign of it as
   yet, we are satisfied to bide the Lord's will, for we have no suspicion
   of His love and faithfulness. He will make sure work of it before long,
   and we will praise Him at once for the coming mercy.

   Aug. 12


   "For thou art my lamp, O Lord: and the Lord will lighten my darkness"
   II Sam. 22:29

   Am I in the light? Then thou, O Lord, art my lamp. Take thee away, and
   my joy would be gone; but as long as thou art with me, I can do without
   the torches of time and the candles of created comfort. What a light
   the presence of God casts on all things! We heard of a lighthouse which
   could be seen for twenty miles, but our Jehovah is not only a God at
   hand, but far off is He seen, even in the enemy's country. O Lord, I am
   as happy as an angel when thy love fills my heart. Thou art all my
   desire.

   Am I in the dark? Then thou, O Lord, wilt lighten my darkness. Before
   long things will change. Affairs may grow more and more dreary, and
   cloud may be piled upon cloud; but if it grow so dark that I cannot see
   my own hand, still I shall see the hand of the Lord. When I cannot find
   a light within me, or among my friends, or in the whole world, the
   Lord, who said "Let there be light," and there was light, can say the
   same again. He will speak me into the sunshine yet. I shall not die but
   live. The day is already breaking. This sweet text shines like a
   morning star. I shall clap my hands for joy ere many hours are passed.

   Aug. 13


   "It shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while
   they are yet speaking, I will hear" Isa. 65:24

   Quick work this! The Lord hears us before we call; and often answers us
   in the same speedy manner. Foreseeing our needs, and our prayers, He so
   arranges providence that before the need actually arises He has
   supplied it, before the trial assails us He has armed us against it.
   This is the promptitude of omniscience, and we have often seen it
   exercised. Before we dreamed of the affliction which was coming, the
   strong consolation which was to sustain us under it had arrived. What a
   prayer-answering God we have!

   The second clause suggests the telephone. Though God be in Heaven and
   we upon earth, yet He makes our word, like His own word, to travel very
   swiftly. When we pray aright we speak into the ear of God. Our gracious
   Mediator presents our petitions at once, and the great Father hears
   them and smiles upon them. Grand praying this! Who would not be much in
   prayer when he knows that he has the ear of the King of kings? This day
   I will pray in faith, not only believing that I shall be heard, but
   that I am heard; not only that I shall be answered, but that I have the
   answer already. Holy Spirit, help me in this!

   Aug. 14


   "And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever" I
   Kings 11:39

   In the family of grace there is discipline, and that discipline is
   severe enough to make it an evil and a bitter thing to sin. Solomon,
   turned aside by his foreign wives, had set up other gods, and
   grievously provoked the God of his father; therefore, ten parts out of
   twelve of the kingdom were rent away, and set up as a rival state. This
   was a sore affliction to the house of David, and it came upon that
   dynasty distinctly from the hand of God, as the result of unholy
   conduct. The Lord will chasten His best beloved servants if they cease
   from full obedience to His laws: perhaps at this very hour such
   chastening is upon us. Let us humbly cry "O Lord, show me wherefore
   thou contendest with me."

   What a sweet saving clause is that -- "but not for ever!" The
   punishment of sin is everlasting, but the fatherly chastisement of it
   in a child of God is but for a season. The sickness, the poverty, the
   depression of spirit, will pass away when they have had their intended
   effect. Remember, we are not under law, but under grace. The rod may
   make us smart, but the sword shall not make us die. Our present grief
   is meant to bring us to repentance, that we may not be destroyed with
   the wicked.

   Aug. 15


   "And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the
   Father may be glorified in the Son" John 14:13

   It is not every believer who has yet learned to pray in Christ's name.
   To ask not only for His sake, but in His name, as authorized by Him, is
   a high order of prayer. We would not dare to ask for some things in
   that blessed name, for it would be a wretched profanation of it; but
   when the petition is so clearly right that we dare set the name of
   Jesus to it, then it must be granted.

   Prayer is all the more sure to succeed because it is for the Father's
   glory through the Son. It glorifies His truth, His faithfulness, His
   power, His grace. The granting of prayer, when offered in the name of
   Jesus, reveals the Father's love to Him, and the honor which He has put
   upon Him. The glory of Jesus and of the Father are so wrapped up
   together, that the grace which magnifies the one magnifies the other.
   The channel is made famous through the fullness of the fountain, and
   the fountain is honored through the channel by which it flows. If the
   answering of our prayers would dishonor our Lord, we would not pray;
   but since in this thing He is glorified, we will pray without ceasing
   in that dear name in which God and His people have a fellowship of
   delight.

   Aug. 16


   "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and
   forsaketh them shall have mercy" Prov. 28:13

   Here is the way of mercy for a guilty and repenting sinner. He must
   cease from the habit of covering sin. This is attempted by falsehood,
   which denies sin; by hypocrisy, which conceals it; by boasting, which
   justifies it; and by loud profession, which tries to make amends for
   it.

   The sinner's business is to confess and forsake. The two must go
   together. Confession must be honestly made to the Lord Himself; and it
   must include within itself acknowledgment of the wrong, sense of its
   evil, and abhorrence of it. We must not throw the fault upon others,
   nor blame circumstances, nor plead natural weakness. We must make a
   clean breast of it, and plead guilty to the indictment. There can be no
   mercy till this is done.

   Furthermore, we must forsake the evil: having owned our fault, we must
   disown all present and future intent to abide in it. We cannot remain
   in rebellion and yet dwell with the King's Majesty. The habit of evil
   must be quitted, together with all places, companions, pursuits, and
   books, which might lead us astray. Not for confession, nor for
   reformation, but in connection with them we find pardon by faith in the
   blood of Jesus.

   Aug. 17

  WHO HAS THE MAJORITY?

   "And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they
   that be with them" II Kings 6:16

   Horses and chariots, and a great host, shut up the prophet in Dothan.
   His young servant was alarmed. How could they escape from such a body
   of armed men? But the prophet had eyes which his servant had not, and
   he could see a greater host with far superior weapons guarding him from
   all harm. Horses of fire are mightier than horses of flesh, and
   chariots of fire are far preferable to chariots of iron.

   Even so is it at this hour. The adversaries of truth are many,
   influential, learned, and crafty; and truth fares ill at their hands;
   and yet the man of God has no cause for trepidation. Agencies, seen and
   unseen, of the most potent kind, are on the side of righteousness. God
   has armies in ambush which will reveal themselves in the hour of need.
   The forces which are on the side of the good and the true far outweigh
   the powers of evil. Therefore, let us keep our spirits up, and walk
   with the gait of men who possess a cheering secret, which has lifted
   them above all fear. We are on the winning side. The battle may be
   sharp, but we know how it will end. Faith, having God with her, is in a
   clear majority: "They that be with us are more than they that be with
   them."

   Aug. 18

  SEEKERS, FINDERS

   "If thou seek him, he will be found of thee" I Chron. 28:9

   We need our God; He is to be had for the seeking; and He will not deny
   Himself to any one of us if we personally seek His face. It is not, if
   thou deserve Him, or purchase His favor, but merely if thou "seek" Him.
   Those who already know the Lord must go on seeking His face by prayer,
   by diligent service, and by holy gratitude: to such He will not refuse
   His favor and fellowship. Those who, as yet, have not known Him to
   their souls' rest should at once commence seeking, and never cease till
   they find Him as their Saviour, their Friend, their Father, and their
   God.

   What strong assurance this promise gives to the seeker! "He that
   seeketh findeth." You, yes you, if you seek your God shall find Him.
   When you find Him you have found life, pardon, sanctification,
   preservation, and glory. Will you not seek, and seek on, since you
   shall not seek in vain? Dear friend, seek the Lord at once. Here is the
   place, and now is the time. Bend that stiff knee; yes, bend that
   stiffer neck, and cry out for God, for the living God. In the name of
   Jesus seek cleansing and justification. You shall not be refused. Here
   is David's testimony to his son Solomon, and it is the writer's
   personal witness to the reader. Believe it and act upon it, for
   Christ's sake.

   Aug. 19


   "So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous:
   verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth" Ps 58:11

   God's judgments in this life are not always clearly to be seen, for in
   many cases one event happeneth alike to all. This is the state of
   probation, not of punishment or reward. Yet at times God works terrible
   things in righteousness, and even the careless are compelled to own His
   hand.

   Even in this life righteousness has that kind of reward which it
   prefers above all others, namely, the smile of God, which creates a
   quiet conscience. Sometimes other recompenses follow, for God will be
   in no man's debt. But, at the same time, the chief reward of the
   righteous lies in the hereafter.

   Meanwhile, on a large scale, we mark the presence of the great Ruler
   among the nations. He breaks in pieces oppressive thrones, and punishes
   guilty peoples. No one can study the history of the rise and fall of
   empires without perceiving that there is a power which makes for
   righteousness, and, in the end, brings iniquity before its bar, and
   condemns it with unsparing justice. Sin shall not go unpunished, and
   goodness shall not remain unrewarded. The Judge of all the earth must
   do right. Therefore, let us fear before Him, and no more dread the
   power of the wicked.

   Aug. 20


   "He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no
   evil touch thee" Job 5:19

   Eliphaz in this spoke the truth of God. We may have as many troubles as
   the workdays of the week, but the God who worked on those six days will
   work for us till our deliverance is complete. We shall rest with Him,
   and in Him on our Sabbath. The rapid succession of trials is one of the
   sorest tests of faith. Before we have recovered from one blow, it is
   followed by another and another till we are staggered. Still, the
   equally quick succession of deliverances is exceedingly cheering. New
   songs are rung out upon the anvil by the hammer of affliction, till we
   see in the spiritual world the anti-type of "the Harmonious
   Blacksmith." Our confidence is, that when the Lord makes our trials
   six, six they will be, and no more.

   It may be that we have no rest day, for seven troubles come upon us.
   What then? "In seven there shall be no evil touch thee." Evil may roar
   at us, but it shall be kept at more than arm's length, and shall not
   even touch us. Its hot breath may distress us, but its little finger
   cannot be laid upon us.

   With our loins girt about us we will meet the six or the seven
   troubles, and leave fear to those who have no Father, no Saviour, and
   no Sanctifier.

   Aug. 21

  NIGHT OF WEEPING; JOYOUS DAY

   "For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may
   endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning" Ps. 30:5

   A moment under our Father's anger seems very long, and yet it is but a
   moment after all. If we grieve His Spirit we cannot look for His smile;
   but He is a God ready to pardon, and He soon puts aside all remembrance
   of our faults. When we faint and are ready to die because of His frown,
   His favor puts new life into us.

   This verse has another note of the semi-quaver kind. Our weeping night
   soon turns into joyous day. Brevity is the mark of mercy in the hour of
   the chastisement of believers. The Lord loves not to use the rod on His
   chosen; He gives a blow or two, and all is over; yea, and the life and
   the joy, which follow the anger and the weeping, more than make amends
   for the salutary sorrow.

   Come, my heart, begin thy hallelujahs! Weep not all through the night,
   but wipe thine eyes in anticipation of the morning. These tears are
   dews which mean us as much good as the sunbeams of the morrow. Tears
   clear the eyes for the sight of God in His grace; and make the vision
   of His favor more precious. A night of sorrow supplies those shades of
   the pictures by which the highlights are brought out with distinctness.
   All is well.

   Aug. 22

  WRATH TO GOD'S GLORY

   "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath
   shalt thou restrain" Ps. 76:10

   Wicked men will be wrathful. Their anger we must endure as the badge of
   our calling, the token of our separation from them: if we were of the
   world, the world would love its own. Our comfort is that the wrath of
   man shall be made to redound to the glory of God. When in their wrath
   the wicked crucified the Son of God they were unwittingly fulfilling
   the divine purpose, and in a thousand cases the willfulness of the
   ungodly is doing the same. They think themselves free, but like
   convicts in chains they are unconsciously working out the decrees of
   the Almighty.

   The devices of the wicked are overruled for their defeat. They act in a
   suicidal way, and baffle their own plottings. Nothing will come of
   their wrath which can do us real harm. When they burned the martyrs,
   the smoke which blew from the stake sickened men of popery more than
   anything else.

   Meanwhile, the Lord has a muzzle and a chain for bears. He restrains
   the more furious wrath of the enemy. He is like a miller who holds back
   the mass of the water in the stream, and what he does allow to flow he
   uses for the turning of his wheel. Let us not sigh, but sing. All is
   well, however hard the wind blows.

   "I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shalt find me"
   Prov. 8:17

   Wisdom loves her lovers, and seeks her seekers. He is already wise who
   seeks to be wise, and he has almost found wisdom who diligently seeks
   her. What is true of wisdom in general is specially true of wisdom
   embodied in our Lord Jesus. Him we are to love and to seek, and in
   return we shall enjoy His love, and find Himself.

   Our business is to seek Jesus early in life. Happy are the young whose
   morning is spent with Jesus! It is never too soon to seek the Lord
   Jesus. Early seekers make certain finders. We should seek Him early by
   diligence. Thriving tradesmen are early risers, and thriving saints
   seek Jesus eagerly. Those who find Jesus to their enrichment give their
   hearts to seeking Him. We must seek Him first, and thus earliest. Above
   all things Jesus. Jesus first, and nothing else even as a bad second.

   The blessing is that He will be found. He reveals Himself more and more
   clearly to our search. He gives Himself up more fully to our
   fellowship. Happy men who seek One who, when He is found, remains with
   them for ever, a treasure growingly precious to their hearts and
   understandings.

   Lord Jesus, I have found thee; be found of me to an unutterable degree
   of joyous satisfaction.

   "For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will
   bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent" I Cor. 1:19

   This verse is a threatening so far as the worldly-wise are concerned,
   but to the simple believer it is a promise. The professedly learned are
   for ever trying to bring to nothing the faith of the humble believer,
   but they fail in their attempts. Their arguments break down, their
   theories fall under their own weight, their deep-laid plots discover
   themselves before their purpose is accomplished. The old gospel is not
   extinct yet, nor will it be while the Lord liveth. If it could have
   been exterminated it would have perished from off the earth long ago.

   We cannot destroy the wisdom of the wise, nor need we attempt it, for
   the work is in far better hands. The Lord Himself says, "I will," and
   He never resolves in vain. Twice does He in this verse declare His
   purpose, and we may rest assured that He will not turn aside from it.

   What clean work the Lord makes of philosophy and "modern thought" when
   He puts His hand to it! He brings the fine appearance down to nothing;
   He utterly destroys the wood, hay, and stubble. It is written that so
   it shall be, and so shall it be. Lord, make short work of it. Amen, and
   Amen.

   "I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the
   Lord God" Ezek. 34:15

   Under the divine shepherdry saints are fed to the full. Theirs is not a
   windy, unsatisfying mess of mere human "thought"; but the Lord feeds
   them upon the solid, substantial truth of divine revelation. There is
   real nutriment for the soul in Scripture brought home to the heart by
   the Holy Spirit. Jesus, Himself, is the true life-sustaining Food of
   believers. Here our Great Shepherd promises that such sacred
   nourishment shall be given us by His own self. If, on the Lord's Day,
   our earthly shepherd is empty-handed, the Lord is not.

   When filled with holy truth the mind rests. Those whom Jehovah feeds
   are at peace. No dog shall worry them, no wolf shall devour them, no
   restless propensities shall disturb them. They shall lie down and
   digest the food which they have enjoyed. The doctrines of grace are not
   only sustaining, but consoling: in them we have the means for building
   up and lying down. If preachers do not give us rest, let us look to the
   Lord for it.

   This day may the Lord cause us to feed in the pastures of the Word, and
   make us to lie down in them. May no folly, and no worry, but Meditation
   and Peace mark this day.

   Aug. 26


   "I will judge between cattle and cattle" Ezek. 34:22

   Some are fat and flourishing, and therefore they are unkind to the
   feeble. This is a grievous sin, and causes much sorrow. Those
   thrustings with side and with shoulder, those pushings of the diseased
   with the horn, are a sad means of offense in the assemblies of
   professing believers. The Lord takes note of these proud and unkind
   deeds, and He is greatly angered by them, for He loves the weak.

   Is the reader one of the despised? Is he a mourner in Zion, and a
   marked man because of his tender conscience? Do his brethren judge him
   harshly? Let him not resent their conduct; above all let him not push
   and thrust in return. Let him leave the matter in the Lord's hands. He
   is the Judge. Why should we wish to intrude upon His office? He will
   decide much more righteously than we can. His time for judgment is the
   best, and we need not be in a hurry to hasten it on.

   Let the hardhearted oppressor tremble. Even though he may ride
   roughshod over others with impunity for the present, all his proud
   speeches are noted, and for every one of them account must be given
   before the bar of the Great Judge.

   Patience, my soul! Patience! The Lord knoweth thy grief. Thy Jesus hath
   pity upon thee!

   Aug. 27


   "I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction" Isa. 48:10

   This has long been the motto fixed before our eye upon the wall of our
   bedroom, and in many ways it has also been written on our heart. It is
   no mean thing to be chosen of God. God's choice makes chosen men choice
   men. Better to be the elect of God than the elect of a whole nation. So
   eminent is this privilege, that whatever drawback may be joined to it
   we very joyfully accept it, even as the Jew ate the bitter herbs for
   the sake of the Paschal Lamb. We choose the furnace, since God chooses
   us in it.

   We are chosen as an afflicted people, and not as a prosperous people,
   chosen not in the palace, but in the furnace. In the furnace beauty is
   marred, fashion is destroyed, strength is melted, glory is consumed,
   and yet here eternal love reveals its secrets, and declares its choice.
   So has it been in our case. In times of severest trial God has made to
   us our calling and election plain, and we have made it sure: then have
   we chosen the Lord to be our God, and He has shown that we are
   assuredly His chosen. Therefore, if today the furnace be heated seven
   times hotter, we will not dread it, for the glorious Son of God will
   walk with us amid the glowing coals.

   Aug. 28


   "As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord shall save me" Ps. 55:16

   Yes, I must and will pray. What else can I do? What better can I do?
   Betrayed, forsaken, grieved, baffled, O my Lord, I will call upon thee.
   My Ziklag is in ashes, and men speak of stoning me; but I encourage my
   heart in the Lord, who will bear me through this trial as He has borne
   me through so many others. Jehovah shall save me; I am sure He will,
   and I declare my faith.

   The Lord and no one else shall save me. I desire no other helper, and
   would not trust in an arm of flesh even if I could. I will cry to Him
   evening, and morning, and noon, and I will cry to no one else, for He
   is All-sufficient.

   How He will save me I cannot guess; but He will do it, I know. He will
   do it in the best and surest way, and He will do it in the largest,
   truest, and fullest sense. Out of this trouble and all future troubles
   the great I AM will bring me as surely as He lives; and when death
   comes, and all the mysteries of eternity follow thereon, still will
   this be true: "the Lord shall save me." This shall be my song all
   through this autumn day. Is it not as a ripe apple from the tree of
   life? I will feed upon it. How sweet it is to my taste!

   Aug. 29


   "Their soul shall be as a watered garden" Jer. 31:12

   Oh, to have one's soul under heavenly cultivation; no longer a
   wilderness, but a garden of the Lord! Enclosed from the waste, walled
   around by grace, planted by instruction, visited by love, weeded by
   heavenly discipline, and guarded by divine power, one's favored soul is
   prepared to yield fruit unto the Lord.

   But a garden may become parched for want of water, and then all its
   herbs decline, and are ready to die. O my soul, how soon would this be
   the case were the Lord to leave thee! In the East, a garden without
   water soon ceases to be a garden at all: nothing can come to
   perfection, grow, or even live. When irrigation is kept up, the result
   is charming. Oh, to have one's soul watered by the Holy Spirit
   uniformly -- every part of the garden having its own stream;
   plentifully -- a sufficient refreshment coming to every tree and herb,
   however thirsty by nature it may be; continually -- each hour bringing
   not only its heat, but its refreshment; wisely -- each plant receiving
   just what it needs. In a garden you can see by the verdure where the
   water flows, and you can soon perceive when the Spirit of God comes.

   O Lord, water me this day, and cause me to yield thee a full reward,
   for Jesus' sake. Amen.

  SOLACE, SECURITY, SATISFACTION

   "Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
   everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all
   my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow" II
   Sam. 23:5

   This is not so much one promise as an aggregate of promises -- a box of
   pearls. The covenant is the ark which contains all things.

   These are the last words of David, but they may be mine today. Here is
   a sigh: things are not with me and mine as I could wish; there are
   trials, cares, and sins. These make the pillow hard.

   Here is a solace -- "He hath made with me an everlasting covenant."
   Jehovah has pledged Himself to me, and sealed the compact with the
   blood of Jesus. I am bound to my God, and my God to me.

   This brings into prominence a security, since this covenant is
   everlasting, well ordered and sure. There is nothing to fear from the
   lapse of time, the failure of some forgotten point, or the natural
   uncertainty of things. The covenant is a rocky foundation to build on
   for life or for death.

   David feels satisfaction: he wants no more for salvation or
   delectation. He is delivered, and he is delighted. The covenant is all
   a man can desire.

   O my soul, turn thou this day to thy Lord Jesus, whom the great Lord
   has given to be a covenant to the people. Take Him to be thine all in
   all.

   Aug. 31

  DIVINE, EVER-LIVING, UNCHANGING

   "But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which
   by the gospel is preached unto you" I Peter 1:25

   All human teaching and, indeed, all human beings, shall pass away as
   the grass of the meadow; but we are here assured that the Word of the
   Lord is of a very different character, for it shall endure for ever.

   We have here a divine gospel; for what word can endure for ever but
   that which is spoken by the eternal God?

   We have here an ever-living gospel, as full of vitality as when it
   first came from the lip of God; as strong to convince and convert, to
   regenerate and console, to sustain and sanctify, as ever it was in its
   first days of wonder-working.

   We have an unchanging gospel, which is not today green grass, and
   tomorrow dry hay; but always the abiding truth of the immutable
   Jehovah. Opinions alter, but truth certified by God can no more change
   than the God who uttered it.

   Here, then, we have a gospel to rejoice in, a word of the Lord upon
   which we may lean all our weight. "For ever" includes life, death,
   judgment, and eternity. Glory be to God in Christ Jesus for everlasting
   consolation. Feed on the word today, and all the days of thy life.

  ABIDING IN OBEDIENCE, IN LOVE

   "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love" John 15:10

   These things cannot be parted -- abiding in obedience, and abiding in
   the love of Jesus. A life under the rule of Christ can alone prove that
   we are the objects of our Lord's delight. We must keep our Lord's
   command if we would bask in His love. If we live in sin we cannot live
   in the love of Christ. Without the holiness which pleases God, we
   cannot please Jesus. He who cares nothing for holiness knows nothing of
   the love of Jesus.

   Conscious enjoyment of our Lord's love is a delicate thing. It is far
   more sensitive to sin and holiness than mercury is to cold and heat.
   When we are tender of heart, and careful in thought, lip, and life to
   honor our Lord Jesus, then we receive tokens of His love without
   number. If we desire to perpetuate such bliss we must perpetuate
   holiness. The Lord Jesus will not hide His face from us unless we hide
   our face from Him. Sin makes the cloud which darkens our Sun: if we
   will be watchfully obedient and completely consecrated, we may walk in
   the light, as God is in the light, and have as sure an abiding in the
   love of Jesus as Jesus has in the love of the Father. Here is a sweet
   promise with a solemn "if." Lord, let me have this "if" in my hand; for
   as a key it opens this casket.

   Sept. 2


   "Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord" Hosea 6:3

   Not all at once, but by degrees shall we attain to holy knowledge, and
   our business is to persevere and learn by little and little. We need
   not despair, though our progress may be slow, for we shall yet know.
   The Lord, who has become our Teacher, will not give us up, however slow
   of understanding we may be; for it is not for His honor that any degree
   of human folly should baffle His skill. The Lord delights to make the
   simple wise.

   Our duty is to keep to our main topic, and follow on to know, not this
   peculiar doctrine nor that, but Jehovah Himself. To know Father, Son,
   and Spirit, the Triune God, this is life eternal: let us keep to this,
   for in this way we shall gain complete instruction. By following on to
   know the Lord, we learn healing after being torn, binding up after
   smiting, and life after death. Experience has its perfect work when the
   heart follows the trackway of the Almighty Lord.

   My soul, keep thou close to Jesus, follow on to know God in Jesus, and
   so shalt thou come to the knowledge of Christ, which is the most
   excellent of all the sciences. The Holy Ghost will lead thee into all
   truth. Is not this His gracious office? Rely upon Him to fulfill it.

   Sept. 3


   "And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves,
   O my people, and brought you up out of your graves" Ezek. 37:13

   Indeed it must be so: those who receive life from the dead are sure to
   recognize the hand of the Lord in such a resurrection. This is the
   greatest and most remarkable of all changes that a man can undergo --
   to be brought out of the grave of spiritual death, and made to rejoice
   in the light and liberty of spiritual life. None could work this but
   the living God, the Lord and giver of life.

   Ah me! How well do I remember when I was lying in the valley full of
   dry bones, as dry as any of them! Blessed was the day when free and
   sovereign grace sent the man of God to prophesy upon me! Glory be to
   God for the stirring which that word of faith caused among the dry
   bones. More blessed still was that heavenly breath from the four winds
   which made me live! Now know I the quickening Spirit of the ever-living
   Jehovah. Truly Jehovah is the living God, for He made me live. My new
   life even in its pinings and sorrowings is clear proof to me that the
   Lord can kill and make alive. He is the only God. He is all that is
   great, gracious, and glorious, and my quickened soul adores Him as the
   great I AM. All glory be unto His sacred name! As long as I live I will
   praise Him.

   Sept. 4


   "But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by
   the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by
   battle, by horses, nor by horsemen" Hosea 1:7

   Precious word! Jehovah Himself will deliver His people in the greatness
   of His mercy, but He will not do it by the ordinary means. Men are slow
   to render to God the glory due unto His name. If they go to battle with
   sword and bow, and win the victory, they ought to praise their God; yet
   they do not, but begin to magnify their own right arm, and glory in
   their horses and horsemen. For this reason our Jehovah often determines
   to save His people without second means, that all the honor may be to
   Himself alone.

   Look, then, my heart, to the Lord alone, and not to man. Expect to see
   God all the more clearly when there is no one else to look to. If I
   have no friend, no adviser, no one at my back, let me be none the less
   confident if I can feel that the Lord Himself is on my side; yea, let
   me be glad if He gives victory without battle, as the text seems to
   imply. Why do I ask for horses and horsemen if Jehovah Himself has
   mercy upon me, and lifts up His arm for my defense? Why need I bow or
   sword if God will save? Let me trust, and not be afraid, from this day
   forth and for evermore. Amen.

   Sept. 5


   "The Lord will be with you" II Chron. 20:17

   This was a great mercy for Jehoshaphat, for a great multitude had come
   out against him; and it will be a great mercy for me, for I have great
   need, and I have no might or wisdom. If the Lord be with me, it matters
   little who may desert me. If the Lord be with me, I shall conquer in
   the battle of life, and the greater my trials the more glorious will be
   my victory. How can I be sure that the Lord is with me?

   For certain He is with me if I am with Him. If I trust in His
   faithfulness, believe His words, and obey His commands, He is assuredly
   with me. If I am on Satan's side God is against me, and cannot be
   otherwise; but if I live to honor God I may be sure that He will honor
   me.

   I am quite sure that God is with me if Jesus is my sole and only
   Saviour. If I have placed my soul in the hands of God's Only-begotten
   Son, then I may be sure that the Father will put forth all His power to
   preserve me, that His Son may not be dishonored.

   Oh for faith to take hold upon the short but sweet text for today! O
   Lord, fulfill this word to thy servant! Be with me in the house, in the
   street, in the field, in the shop, in company, and alone. Be thou also
   with all thy people.

   Sept. 6


   "Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
   heart: wait, I say, on the Lord" Ps. 27:14

   Wait! Wait! Let your waiting be on the Lord! He is worth waiting for.
   He never disappoints the waiting soul.

   While waiting keep up your spirits. Expect a great deliverance, and be
   ready to praise God for it.

   The promise which should cheer you is in the middle of the verse -- "He
   shall strengthen thine heart." This goes at once to the place where you
   need help. If the heart be sound, all the rest of the system will work
   well. The heart wants calming and cheering; and both of these will come
   if it be strengthened. A forceful heart rests and rejoices, and throbs
   force into the whole man.

   No one else can get at that secret urn of life, the heart, so as to
   pour strength into it. He alone who made it can make it strong. God is
   full of strength, and, therefore, He can impart it to those who need
   it. Oh, be brave; for the Lord will impart His strength to you, and you
   shall be calm in tempest, and glad in sorrow.

   He who penned these lines can write as David did--"Wait, I say, on the
   Lord." I do, indeed, say it. I know by long and deep experience that it
   is good for me to wait upon the Lord.

   Sept. 7


   "It shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them,
   Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons
   of the living God" Hosea 1:10

   Sovereign grace can make strangers into sons, and the Lord here
   declares His purpose to deal thus with rebels, and make them know what
   He has done. Beloved reader, the Lord has done this in my case; has He
   done the like for you? Then let us join hands and hearts in praising
   His adorable name.

   Some of us were so decidedly ungodly that the Lord's Word most truly
   said to our conscience and heart, "Ye are not my people." In the house
   of God, and in our own homes, when we read the Bible, this was the
   voice of God's Spirit in our soul, "Ye are not my people." Truly a sad
   condemning voice it was. But now, in the same places, from the same
   ministry and Scripture, we hear a voice, which saith, "Ye are the sons
   of the living God." Can we be grateful enough for this? Is it not
   wonderful? Does it not give us hope for others? Who is beyond the reach
   of almighty grace? How can we despair of any, since the Lord has
   wrought so marvelous a change in us?

   He who has kept this one great promise will keep every other;
   wherefore, let us go forward with songs of adoration and confidence.

   Sept. 8


   "A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not
   quench" Isa. 42:3

   Then I may reckon upon tender treatment from my Lord. Indeed, I feel
   myself to be at best as weak, as pliant, as worthless as a reed.
   Someone said, "I don't care a rush for you," and the speech, though
   unkind, was not untrue. Alas! I am worse than a reed when it grows by
   the river, for that at least can hold up its head. I am bruised,
   sorely, sadly bruised. There is no music in me now; there is a rift
   which lets out all the melody. Ah, me! Yet Jesus will not break me; and
   if he will not, then I mind little what others try to do. O sweet and
   compassionate Lord, I nestle down beneath thy protection, and forget my
   bruises!

   Truly I am also fit to be likened to "the smoking flax," whose light is
   gone, and only its smoke remains. I fear I am rather a nuisance than a
   benefit. My fears tell me that the devil has blown out my light, and
   left me an obnoxious smoke, and that my Lord will soon put an
   extinguisher upon me. Yet I perceive that though there were snuffers
   under the law, there were no extinguishers; and Jesus will not quench
   me; therefore, I am hopeful. Lord, kindle me anew, and cause me to
   shine forth to thy glory, and to the extolling of thy tenderness.

   Sept. 9


   "Happy is the man that feareth alway" Prov. 28:14

   The fear of the Lord is the beginning and the foundation of all true
   religion. Without a solemn awe and reverence of God there is no
   foothold for the more brilliant virtues. He whose soul does not worship
   will never live in holiness.

   He is happy who feels a jealous fear of doing wrong. Holy fear looks
   not only before it leaps, but even before it moves. It is afraid of
   error, afraid of neglecting duty, afraid of committing sin. It fears
   ill company, loose talk, and questionable policy. This does not make a
   man wretched, but it brings him happiness. The watchful sentinel is
   happier than the soldier who sleeps at his post. He who forseeth evil
   and escapes it is happier than he who walks carelessly on and is
   destroyed.

   Fear of God is a quiet grace which leads a man along a choice road, of
   which it is written, "No lion shall be there, neither shall any
   ravenous beast go up thereon." Fear of the very appearance of evil is a
   purifying principle, which enables a man, through the power of the Holy
   Spirit, to keep his garments unspotted from the world. In both senses
   he that "feareth alway" is made happy. Solomon had tried both
   worldliness and holy fear: in the one he found vanity, in the other
   happiness. Let us not repeat his trial, but abide by his verdict.

   Sept. 10

  COMING IN; GOING OUT

   "Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be
   when thou goest out" Deut. 28:6

   The blessings of the law are not cancelled. Jesus confirmed the promise
   when He bore the penalty. If I keep the commands of my Lord, I may
   appropriate this promise without question.

   This day I will come in to my house without fear of evil tidings, and I
   will come into my closet expecting to hear good news from my Lord. I
   will not be afraid to come in unto myself by self-examination, nor to
   come in to my affairs by a diligent inspection of my business. I have a
   good deal of work to do indoors, within my own soul; oh, for a blessing
   upon it all, the blessing of the Lord Jesus, who has promised to abide
   with me.

   I must also go out. Timidity makes me wish that I could stay within
   doors, and never go into the sinful world again. But I must go out in
   my calling, and I must go out that I may be helpful to my brethren, and
   useful to the ungodly. I must be a defender of the faith and an
   assailant of evil. Oh, for a blessing upon my going out this day! Lord,
   let me go where Thou leadest, on Thy errands, under Thy command, and in
   the power of Thy Spirit.

   Lord Jesus, turn in with me and be my guest; and then walk out with me,
   and cause my heart to burn while You speak with me by the way.

   Sept. 11


   "It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth" Lam. 3:27

   This is as good as a promise. It has been good, it is good, and it will
   be good for me to bear the yoke.

   Early in life I had to feel the weight of conviction, and ever since it
   has proved a soul-enriching burden. Should I have loved the gospel so
   well had I not learned by deep experience the need of salvation by
   grace? Jabez was more honorable than his brethren because his mother
   bare him with sorrow, and those who suffer much in being born unto God
   make strong believers in sovereign grace.

   The yoke of censure is an irksome one, but it prepares a man for future
   honor. He is not fit to be a leader who has not run the gauntlet of
   contempt. Praise intoxicates if it be not preceded by abuse. Men who
   rise to eminence without a struggle usually fall into dishonor.

   The yoke of affliction, disappointment, and excessive labor is by no
   means to be sought for; but when the Lord lays it on us in our youth it
   frequently develops a character which glorifies God and blesses the
   Church.

   Come, my soul, bow thy neck; take up thy cross. It was good for thee
   when young, it will not harm thee now. For Jesus' sake, shoulder it
   cheerfully.

   Sept. 12

  WHAT OF MY HOUSE?

   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy
   house" Acts 16:31

   This gospel for a man with a sword at his throat is the gospel for me.
   This would suit me if I were dying, and it is all that I need while I
   am living. I look away from self, and sin, and all idea of personal
   merit, and I trust the Lord Jesus as the Saviour whom God has given. I
   believe in Him, I rest on Him, I accept Him to be my all in all. Lord,
   I am saved, and I shall be saved to all eternity, for I believe in
   Jesus. Blessed be thy name for this. May I daily prove by my life that
   I am saved from selfishness, and worldliness, and every form of evil.

   But those last words about my "house": Lord, I would not run away with
   half a promise when thou dost give a whole one. I beseech thee, save
   all my family. Save the nearest and dearest. Convert the children, and
   the grandchildren, if I have any. Be gracious to my servants, and all
   who dwell under my roof, or work for me. Thou makest this promise to me
   personally if I believe in the Lord Jesus; I beseech thee to do as thou
   hast said.

   I would go over in my prayer every day the names of all my brothers and
   sisters, parents, children, friends, relatives, servants, and give thee
   no rest till that word is fulfilled, "and thy house."

   "His heavens shall drop down dew" Deut. 33:28

   What the dew in the East is to the world of nature, that is the
   influence of the Spirit in the realm of grace. How greatly do I need
   it! Without the Spirit of God I am a dry and withered thing. I droop, I
   fade, I die. How sweetly does this dew refresh me! When once favored
   with it I feel happy, lively, vigorous, elevated. I want nothing more.
   The Holy Spirit brings me life, and all that life requires. All else
   without the dew of the Spirit is less than nothing to me: I hear, I
   read, I pray, I sing, I go to the table of communion, and I find no
   blessing there until the Holy Ghost visits me. But when He bedews me,
   every means of grace is sweet and profitable.

   What a promise is this for me! "His heavens shall drop down dew." I
   shall be visited with grace. I shall not be left to my natural drought,
   or to the world's burning heat, or to the sirocco of Satanic
   temptation. Oh, that I may at this very hour feel the gentle, silent,
   saturating dew of the Lord! Why should I not? He who has made me to
   live as the grass lives in the meadow, will treat me as He treats the
   grass; He will refresh me from above. Grass cannot call for dew as I
   do. Surely, the Lord who visits the unpraying plant will answer to His
   pleading child.

   Sept. 14


   "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he
   shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
   that love him" James 1:12

   Yes, he is blessed while he is enduring the trial. No eye can see this
   till it has been anointed with heavenly eye-salve. But he must endure
   it, and neither rebel against God, nor turn aside from his integrity.
   He is blessed who has gone through the fire, and has not been consumed
   as a counterfeit.

   When the test is over, then comes the hallmark of divine approval --
   "the crown of life." As if the Lord said, "Let him live; he has been
   weighed in the balances, and he is not found wanting." Life is the
   reward: not mere being; but holy, happy, true existence, the
   realization of the divine purpose concerning us. Already a higher form
   of spiritual life and enjoyment crowns those who have safely passed
   through fiercest trials of faith and love.

   The Lord hath promised the crown of life to those who love Him. Only
   lovers of the Lord will hold out in the hour of trial; the rest will
   either sink or sulk, or slink back to the world. Come, my heart, dost
   thou love thy Lord? Truly? Deeply? Wholly? Then that love will be
   tried; but many waters will not quench it, neither will the floods
   drown it. Lord, let thy love nourish mine to the end.

   Sept. 15


   "And a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind and a covert from
   the tempest." Isa. 32:2

   Who this MAN is we all know. Who could He be but the Second Man, the
   Lord from Heaven, the Man of sorrows, the Son of Man? What a
   hiding-place He has been to His people! He bears the full force of the
   wind Himself, and so He shelters those who hide themselves in Him. We
   have thus escaped the wrath of God, and we shall thus escape the anger
   of men, the cares of this life, and the dread of death. Why do we stand
   in the wind when we may so readily and so surely get out of it by
   hiding behind our Lord? Let us this day run to Him, and be at peace.

   Often the common wind of trouble rises in its force and becomes a
   tempest, sweeping everything before it. Things which looked firm and
   stable rock in the blast, and many and great are the falls among our
   carnal confidences. Our Lord Jesus, the glorious Man, is a covert which
   is never blown down. In Him we mark the tempest sweeping by, but we
   ourselves rest in delightful serenity.

   This day let us just stow ourselves away in our hiding-place, and sit
   and sing under the protection of our Covert. Blessed Jesus! Blessed
   Jesus! How we love thee! Well we may, for thou art to us a shelter in
   the time of storm.

   Sept. 16


   "And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup
   of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he
   shall in no wise lose his reward" Matt. 10:42

   Well, I can do as much as that. I can do a kind act toward the Lord's
   servant. The Lord knows I love them all, and would count it an honor to
   wash their feet. For the sake of their Master I love the disciples.

   How gracious of the Lord to mention so insignificant an action -- "to
   give to drink a cup of cold water only"! This I can do, however poor:
   this I may do, however lowly: this I will do right cheerfully. This,
   which seems so little, the Lord notices -- notices when done to the
   least of His followers. Evidently it is not the cost, nor the skill,
   nor the quantity, that He looks at, but the motive: that which we do to
   a disciple, because he is a disciple, his Lord observes, and
   recompenses. He does not reward us for the merit of what we do, but
   according to the riches of His grace.

   I give a cup of cold water, and He makes me to drink of living water. I
   give to one of His little ones, and He treats me as one of them. Jesus
   finds an apology for His liberality in that which His grace has led me
   to do, and He says, "He shall in no wise lose his reward."

   Sept. 17


   "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a
   cedar in Lebanon" Ps. 92:12

   These trees are not trained and pruned by man: palms and cedars are
   "trees of the Lord," and it is by His care that they flourish; even so
   it is with the saints of the Lord, they are His own care. These trees
   are evergreen and are beautiful objects at all seasons of the year.
   Believers are not sometimes holy and sometimes ungodly: they stand in
   the beauty of the Lord under all weathers. Everywhere these trees are
   noteworthy: no one can gaze upon a landscape in which there are either
   palms or cedars without his attention being fixed upon these royal
   growths. The followers of Jesus are the observed of all observers: like
   a city set on a hill they cannot be hid.

   The child of God flourishes like a palm tree, which pushes all its
   strength upward in one erect column without a single branch. It is a
   pillar with a glorious capital. It has no growth to the right or to the
   left, but sends all its force heavenward, and bears its fruit as near
   the sky as possible. Lord, fulfill this type in me.

   The cedar braves all storms, and grows near the eternal snows, the Lord
   Himself filling it with a sap which keeps its heart warm and its boughs
   strong. Lord, so let it be with me, I pray thee. Amen.

   Sept. 18


   "And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety
   by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall
   dwell between his shoulders" Deut. 33:12

   Yes, there is no safety like that which comes of dwelling near to God.
   For His best beloved the Lord can find no surer or safer place. O Lord,
   let me always abide under thy shadow, close to thy wounded side. Nearer
   and nearer would I come to thee, my Lord; and when once specially near
   thee, I would abide there for ever.

   What a covering is that which the Lord gives to His chosen! Not a fair
   roof shall cover him, nor a bombproof casement, nor even an angel's
   wing, but Jehovah Himself. Nothing can come at us when we are thus
   covered. This covering the Lord will grant us all the day long, however
   long the day. Lord, let me abide this day consciously beneath this
   canopy of love, this pavilion of sovereign power.

   Does the third clause mean that the Lord in His temple would dwell
   among the mountains of Benjamin, or that the Lord would be where
   Benjamin's burden should be placed, or does it mean that we are borne
   upon the shoulders of the Eternal? In any case, the Lord is the support
   and strength of His saints. Lord, let me ever enjoy thy help and then
   my arms will be sufficient for me.

   Sept. 19


   "The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will
   rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over
   thee with singing" Zeph. 3:17

   What a word is this! Jehovah God in the center of His people in all the
   majesty of His power! This presence alone suffices to inspire us with
   peace and hope. Treasures of boundless might are stored in our Jehovah,
   and He dwells in His church, therefore may His people shout for joy.

   We not only have His presence, but He is engaged upon His choice work
   of salvation. "He will save." He is always saving: He takes His name of
   Jesus from it. Let us not fear any danger, for He is mighty to save.

   Nor is this all. He abides evermore the same; He loves, He finds rest
   in loving, He will not cease to love. His love gives Him joy. He even
   finds a theme for song in His beloved. This is exceedingly wonderful.
   When God wrought creation He did not sing, but simply said, "It is very
   good"; but when He came to redemption, then the sacred Trinity felt a
   joy to be expressed in song. Think of it, and be astonished! Jehovah
   Jesus sings a marriage song over His chosen bride. She is to Him His
   love, His joy, His rest, His song. O Lord Jesus, by thine immeasurable
   love to us teach us to love thee, to rejoice in thee, and to sing unto
   thee our life-psalm.

   Sept. 20


   "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power" Ps. 110:3

   Blessed be the God of grace that it is so! He has a people whom He has
   chosen from of old to be His peculiar portion. These by nature have
   wills as stubborn as the rest of the froward sons of Adam; but when the
   day of His power comes, and grace displays its omnipotence, they become
   willing to repent, and to believe in Jesus. None are saved unwillingly,
   but the will is made sweetly to yield itself. What a wondrous power is
   this, which never violates the will, and yet rules it! God does not
   break the lock, but He opens it by a master-key which He alone can
   handle.

   Now are we willing to be, to do, or to suffer as the Lord wills. If at
   any time we grow rebellious He has but to come to us with power, and
   straightway we run in the way of His commands with all our hearts. May
   this be a day of power with me as to some noble effort for the glory of
   God and the good of my fellow-men! Lord, I am willing; may I not hope
   that this is a day of thy power? I am wholly at thy disposal; willing,
   yea, eager, to be used of thee for thy holy purposes. O Lord, let me
   not have to cry, "To will is present with me, but how to perform that
   which I would, I find not," but give me power as thou givest me will.

   Sept. 21


   "Knowing that tribulation worketh patience" Rom. 5:3

   This is a promise in essence if not in form. We have need of patience,
   and here we see the way of getting it. It is only by enduring that we
   learn to endure, even as by swimming men learn to swim. You could not
   learn that art on dry land, nor learn patience without trouble. Is it
   not worth while to suffer tribulation for the sake of gaining that
   beautiful equanimity of mind which quietly acquiesces in all the will
   of God?

   Yet our text sets forth a singular fact, which is not according to
   nature, but is supernatural. Tribulation in and of itself worketh
   petulance, unbelief, and rebellion. It is only by the sacred alchemy of
   grace that it is made to work in us patience. We do not thresh the
   wheat to lay the dust: yet the flail of tribulation does this upon
   God's floor. We do not toss a man about in order to give him rest, and
   yet so the Lord dealeth with His children. Truly this is not the manner
   of man, but greatly redounds to the glory of our all-wise God.

   Oh, for grace to let my trials bless me! Why should I wish to stay
   their gracious operation? Lord, I ask thee to remove my affliction, but
   I beseech thee ten times more to remove my impatience. Precious Lord
   Jesus, with thy cross engrave the image of thy patience on my heart.

   Sept. 22


   "But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers
   and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall
   gallant ship pass thereby" Isa. 33:21

   The Lord will be to us the greatest good without any of the drawbacks
   which seem necessarily to attend the best earthly things. If a city is
   favored with broad rivers, it is liable to be attacked by galleys with
   oars, and other ships of war. But when the Lord represents the
   abundance of His bounty under this figure, He takes care expressly to
   shut out the fear which the metaphor might suggest. Blessed be His
   perfect love!

   Lord, if thou send me wealth like broad rivers, do not let the galley
   with oars come up in the shape of worldliness or pride. If thou grant
   me abundant health and happy spirits, do not let "the gallant ship" of
   carnal ease come sailing up the flowing flood. If I have success in
   holy service, broad as the German Rhine, yet let me never find the
   galley of self-conceit and self-confidence floating on the waves of my
   usefulness. Should I be so supremely happy as to enjoy the light of thy
   countenance year after year, yet let me never despise thy feeble
   saints, nor allow the vain notion of my own perfection to sail up the
   broad rivers of my full assurance. Lord, give me that blessing which
   maketh rich, and neither addeth sorrow, nor addeth sin.

   Sept. 23


   "For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all
   nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least
   grain fall upon the earth!" Amos 9:9

   The sifting process is going on still. Wherever we go, we are still
   being winnowed and sifted. In all countries God's people are being
   tried "like as corn is sifted in a sieve." Sometimes the devil holds
   the sieve, and tosses us up and down at a great rate, with the earnest
   desire to get rid of us for ever. Unbelief is not slow to agitate our
   heart and mind with its restless fears. The world lends a willing hand
   at the same process, and shakes us to the right and to the left with
   great vigor. Worst of all, the church, so largely apostate as it is,
   comes in to give a more furious force to the sifting process.

   Well, well! Let it go on. Thus is the chaff severed from the wheat.
   Thus is the wheat delivered from dust and chaff. And how great is the
   mercy which comes to us in the text, "yet shall not the least grain
   fall upon the earth"! All shall be preserved that is good, true,
   gracious. Not one of the least of believers shall be lost, neither
   shall any believer lose anything worth calling a loss. We shall be so
   kept in the sifting that it shall be a real gain to us through Christ
   Jesus.

   Sept. 24

  THE LIFE-GIVING STREAM

   "And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth,
   whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live" Ezek. 47:9

   The living waters, in the prophet's vision, flowed into the Dead Sea,
   and carried life with them, even into that stagnant lake. Where grace
   goes, spiritual life is the immediate and the everlasting consequence.
   Grace proceeds sovereignly according to the will of God, even as a
   river in all its windings follows its own sweet will; and wherever it
   comes it does not wait for life to come to it, but it creates life by
   its own quickening flow. Oh, that it would pour along our streets, and
   flood our slums! Oh, that it would now come into my house, and rise
   till every chamber were made to swim with it! Lord, let the living
   water flow to my family and my friends, and let it not pass me by. I
   hope I have drunk of it already; but I desire to bathe in it, yea, to
   swim in it. O my Saviour, I need life more abundantly. Come to me, I
   pray thee, till every part of my nature is vividly energetic and
   intensely active. Living God, I pray thee, fill me with thine own life.
   I am a poor, dry stick; come and make me so to live that, like Aaron's
   rod, I may bud and blossom and bring forth fruit unto thy glory.
   Quicken me, for the sake of my Lord Jesus. Amen.

   Sept. 25


   "If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a
   burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have
   showed us all these things" Judges 13:23

   This is a sort of promise deduced by logic. It is an inference fairly
   drawn from ascertained facts. It was not likely that the Lord had
   revealed to Manoah and his wife that a son would be born to them, and
   yet had it in His heart to destroy them. The wife reasoned well, and we
   shall do well if we follow her line of argument.

   The Father has accepted the great sacrifice of Calvary, and has
   declared Himself well pleased therewith; how can He now be pleased to
   kill us? Why a substitute if the sinner must still perish? The accepted
   sacrifice of Jesus puts an end to fear.

   The Lord has shown us our election, our adoption, our union to Christ,
   our marriage to the Well-beloved: how can he now destroy us? The
   promises are loaded with blessings, which necessitate our being
   preserved unto eternal life. It is not possible for the Lord to cast us
   away, and yet fulfill His covenant. The past assures us, and the future
   reassures us. We shall not die, but live; for we have seen Jesus, and
   in Him we have seen the Father by the illumination of the Holy Ghost.
   Because of this life-giving sight we must live for ever.

   Sept. 26


   "Lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the
   nations" Num. 23:9

   Who would wish to dwell among the nations, and to be numbered with
   them? Why, even the professing church is such that to follow the Lord
   fully within its bounds is very difficult. There is such a mingling and
   mixing that one often sighs for "a lodge in some vast wilderness."

   Certain it is that the Lord would have His people follow a separated
   path as to the world, and come out decidedly and distinctly from it. We
   are set apart by the divine decree, purchase, and calling, and our
   inward experience has made us greatly to differ from men of the world;
   and therefore our place is not in their Vanity Fair, nor in their City
   of Destruction, but in the narrow way where all true pilgrims must
   follow their Lord.

   This may not only reconcile us to the world's cold shoulder and sneers,
   but even cause us to accept them with pleasure as being a part of our
   covenant portion. Our names are not in the same book, we are not of the
   same seed, we are not bound for the same place, neither are we trusting
   to the same guide, therefore it is well that we are not of their
   number. Only let us be found in the number of the redeemed, and we are
   content to be odd and solitary to the end of the chapter.

   Sept. 27


   "For thou wilt light my candle" Ps. 18:28

   It may be that my soul sits in darkness; and if this be of a spiritual
   kind, no human power can bring me light. Blessed be God! He can
   enlighten my darkness, and at once light my candle. Even though I may
   be surrounded by a "darkness which might be felt," yet He can break the
   gloom, and immediately make it bright around me.

   The mercy is, that if He lights the candle none can blow it out,
   neither will it go out for lack of substance, nor burn out of itself
   through the lapse of hours. The lights which the Lord kindled in the
   beginning are shining still. The Lord's lamps may need trimming, but He
   does not put them out.

   Let me, then, like the nightingale, sing in the dark. Expectation shall
   furnish me with music, and hope shall pitch the tune. Soon I shall
   rejoice in a candle of God's lighting. I am dull and dreary just now.
   Perhaps it is the weather, or bodily weakness, or the surprise of a
   sudden trouble; but whatever has made the darkness, it is God alone who
   will bring the light. My eyes are unto Him alone. I shall soon have the
   candles of the Lord shining about me; and, further on in His own good
   time, I shall be where they need no candle, neither light of the sun.
   Hallelujah!

   Sept. 28

  WORK IS DONE; REST IN HIM

   "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God" Heb. 4:9

   God has provided a Sabbath, and some must enter into it. Those to whom
   it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief; therefore,
   that Sabbath remains for the people of God. David sang of it; but he
   had to touch the minor key, for Israel refused the rest of God. Joshua
   could not give it, nor Canaan yield it: it remains for believers.

   Come, then, let us labor to enter into this rest. Let us quit the weary
   toil of sin and self. Let us cease from all confidence, even in those
   works of which it might be said, "They are very good." Have we any
   such? Still, let us cease from our own works, as God did from His. Now
   let us find solace in the finished work of our Lord Jesus. Everything
   is fully done: justice demands no more. Great peace is our portion in
   Christ Jesus.

   As to providential matters, the work of grace in the soul, and the work
   of the Lord in the souls of others, let us cast these burdens upon the
   Lord, and rest in Him. When the Lord gives us a yoke to bear, He does
   so that by taking it up we may find rest. By faith we labor to enter
   into the rest of God, and we renounce all rest in self-satisfaction or
   indolence. Jesus Himself is perfect rest and we are filled to the brim
   in Him.

   Sept. 29


   "He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it
   unto you." John 16:14

   The Holy Ghost Himself cannot better glorify the Lord Jesus than by
   showing to us Christ's own things. Jesus is His own best commendation.
   There is no adorning Him except with His own gold.

   The Comforter shows us that which He has received of our Lord Jesus. We
   never see anything aright till He reveals it. He has a way of opening
   our minds, and of opening the Scriptures, and by this double process He
   sets forth our Lord to us. There is much art in setting forth a matter,
   and that art belongs in the highest degree to the Spirit of truth. He
   shows us the things themselves. This is a great privilege, as those
   know who have enjoyed the hallowed vision.

   Let us seek the illumination of the Spirit; not to gratify our
   curiosity, nor even to bring us personal comfort, so much as to glorify
   the Lord Jesus. Oh, to have worthy ideas of Him! Groveling notions
   dishonor our precious Lord. Oh, to have such vivid impressions of His
   person, and work, and glory, that we may with heart and soul cry out to
   His praise! Where there is a heart enriched by the Holy Ghost's
   teaching there will be a Saviour glorified beyond expression. Come,
   Holy Spirit, heavenly light, and show us Jesus our Lord!

   Sept. 30


   "Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it" Ps. 81:10

   What an encouragement to pray! Our human notions would lead us to ask
   small things because our deservings are so small; but the Lord would
   have us request great blessings. Prayer should be as simple a matter as
   the opening of the mouth; it should be a natural, unconstrained
   utterance. When a man is earnest he opens his mouth wide, and our text
   urges us to be fervent in our supplications.

   Yet it also means that we may make bold with God, and ask many and
   large blessings at His hands. Read the whole verse, and see the
   argument: "I am Jehovah, thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it." Because the Lord has
   given us so much He invites us to ask for more, yea, to expect more.

   See how the little birds in their nests seem to be all mouth when the
   mother comes to feed them. Let it be the same with us. Let us take in
   grace at every door. Let us drink it in as a sponge sucks up the water
   in which it lies. God is ready to fill us if we are only ready to be
   filled. Let our needs make us open our mouths; let our faintness cause
   us to open our mouths and pant; yea, let our alarm make us open our
   mouths with a child's cry. The opened mouth shall be filled by the Lord
   Himself. So be it unto us, O Lord, this day.

   "He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of
   his covenant" Ps. 111:5

   Those who fear God need not fear want. Through all these long years the
   Lord has always found meat for His own children, whether they have been
   in the wilderness, or by the brook Cherith, or in captivity, or in the
   midst of famine. Hitherto the Lord has given us day by day our daily
   bread, and we doubt not that He will continue to feed us till we want
   no more.

   As to the higher and greater blessings of the covenant of grace, He
   will never cease to supply them as our case demands. He is mindful that
   He made the covenant, and never acts as if He regretted it. He is
   mindful of it when we provoke Him to destroy us. He is mindful to love
   us, keep us, and comfort us, even as He engaged to do. He is mindful of
   every jot and tittle of His engagements, never suffering one of His
   words to fall to the ground.

   We are sadly unmindful of our God, but He is graciously mindful of us.
   He cannot forget His Son who is the Surety of the Covenant, nor His
   Holy Spirit who actively carries out the covenant, nor His own honor,
   which is bound up with the covenant. Hence the foundation of God
   standeth sure, and no believer shall lose his divine inheritance, which
   is his by a covenant of salt.

   "And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit
   you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to
   Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob" Gen. 50:24

   Joseph had been an incarnate providence to his brethren. All our
   Josephs die, and a thousand comforts die with them. Egypt was never the
   same to Israel after Joseph was dead, nor can the world again be to
   some of us what it was when our beloved ones were alive.

   But see how the pain of that sad death was alleviated! They had a
   promise that the living God would visit them. A visit from Jehovah!
   What a favor! What a consolation! What a Heaven below! O Lord, visit us
   this day; though indeed we are not worthy that thou shouldest come
   under our roof.

   But more was promised: the Lord would bring them out. They would find
   in Egypt a cold welcome when Joseph was dead; nay, it would become to
   them a house of bondage. But it was not to be so for ever; they would
   come out of it by a divine deliverance, and march to the land of
   promise. We shall not weep here for ever. We shall be called home to
   the glory-land to join our dear ones. Wherefore, "comfort one another
   with these words."

  REFLECTORS OF THE LORD'S BEAUTY

   "As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be
   satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness" Ps. 17:15

   The portion of other men fills their bodies, and enriches their
   children, but the portion of the believer is of another sort. Men of
   the world have their treasure in this world, but men of the world to
   come look higher and further.

   Our possession is twofold. We have God's presence here and His likeness
   hereafter. Here we behold the face of the Lord in righteousness, for we
   are justified in Christ Jesus. Oh, the joy of beholding the face of a
   reconciled God! The glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ yields us
   Heaven below, and it will be to us the Heaven of Heaven above.

   But seeing does not end it: we are to be changed into that which we
   gaze upon. We shall sleep a while and then wake up to find ourselves as
   mirrors which reflect the beauties of our Lord. Faith sees God with a
   transforming look. The heart receives the image of Jesus into its own
   depths, till the character of Jesus is imprinted on the soul. This is
   satisfaction. To see God and to be like Him -- what more can I desire?
   David's assured confidence is here by the Holy Ghost made to be the
   Lord's promise. I believe it. I expect it. Lord, vouchsafe it. Amen.

   "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me"
   John 12:32

   Come, ye workers, be encouraged. You fear that you cannot draw a
   congregation. Try the preaching of a crucified, risen, and ascended
   Saviour; for this is the greatest "draw" that was ever yet manifested
   among men. What drew you to Christ but Christ? What draws you to Him
   now but His own blessed self? If you have been drawn to religion by
   anything else, you will soon be drawn away from it; but Jesus has held
   you, and will hold you even to the end. Why, then, doubt His power to
   draw others? Go with the name of Jesus to those who have hitherto been
   stubborn, and see if it does not draw them.

   No sort of man is beyond this drawing power. Old and young, rich and
   poor, ignorant and learned, depraved or amiable -- all men shall feel
   the attractive force. Jesus is the one magnet. Let us not think of any
   other. Music will not draw to Jesus, neither will eloquence, logic,
   ceremonial, or noise. Jesus Himself must draw men to Himself; and Jesus
   is quite equal to the work in every case. Be not tempted by the
   quackeries of the day; but as workers for the Lord work in His own way,
   and draw with the Lord's own cords. Draw to Christ, and draw by Christ,
   for then Christ will draw by you.

  AT GOD'S BIDDING

   "And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew
   from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for
   man, nor waiteth for the sons of men." Micah 5:7

   If this be true of the literal Israel, much more is it true of the
   spiritual Israel, the believing people of God. When saints are what
   they should be, they are an incalculable blessing to those among whom
   they are scattered.

   They are as the dew; for in a quiet, unobtrusive manner they refresh
   those around them. Silently but effectually they minister to the life,
   growth, and joy of those who dwell with them. Coming fresh from Heaven,
   glistening like diamonds in the sun, gracious men and women attend to
   the feeble and insignificant till each blade of grass has its own drop
   of dew. Little as individuals, they are, when united, all-sufficient
   for the purposes of love which the Lord fulfills through them. Dewdrops
   accomplish the refreshing of broad acres. Lord, make us like the dew!

   Godly people are as showers which come at God's bidding without man's
   leave and license. They work for God whether men desire it or not; they
   no more ask human permission than the rain does. Lord, make us thus
   boldly prompt, and free in thy service wherever our lot is cast.

   "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into
   all truth" John 16:13

   Truth is like a vast cavern into which we desire to enter, but we are
   not able to traverse it alone. At the entrance it is clear and bright;
   but if we would go further and explore its innermost recesses, we must
   have a guide, or we shall lose ourselves. The Holy Spirit, who knows
   all truth perfectly, is the appointed guide of all true believers, and
   He conducts them as they are able to bear it, from one inner chamber to
   another, so that they behold the deep things of God, and His secret is
   made plain to them.

   What a promise is this for the humbly inquiring mind! We desire to know
   the truth, and to enter into it. We are conscious of our own aptness to
   err, and we feel the urgent need of a guide. We rejoice that the Holy
   Spirit is come and abides among us. He condescends to act as a guide to
   us, and we gladly accept His leadership. "All truth" we wish to learn,
   that we may not be one-sided and out of balance. We would not be
   willingly ignorant of any part of revelation lest thereby we should
   miss blessing, or incur sin. The Spirit of God has come that He may
   guide us into all truth: let us with obedient hearts hearken to His
   words and follow His lead.

   "He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said
   unto you." Mark 16:7

   Where He appointed to meet His disciples, there He would be in due
   time. Jesus keeps His tryst. If He promises to meet us at the
   mercy-seat, or in public worship, or in the ordinances, we may depend
   upon it that He will be there. We may wickedly stay away from the
   appointed meeting-place, but He never does. He says, "Where two or
   three are met together in my name, there am I"; he says not "There will
   I be," but, "I am there already."

   Jesus is always first in fellowship: "He goeth before you." His heart
   is with His people, His delight is in them, He is never slow to meet
   them. In all fellowship, He goeth before us.

   But he reveals Himself to those who come after Him: "There shall ye see
   him." Joyful sight! We care not to see the greatest of mere men, but to
   see HIM is to be filled with joy and peace. And we shall see Him, for
   He promises to come to those who believe in Him, and to manifest
   Himself to them. Rest assured that it will be so, for He does
   everything according to His word of promise: "As he said unto you."
   Catch at those last words, and be assured that to the end He will do
   for you "as he said unto you."

   "Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken" Isa. 62:4

   "Forsaken" is a dreary word. It sounds like a knell. It is the record
   of sharpest sorrows, and the prophecy of direst ills. An abyss of
   misery yawns in that word "Forsaken." Forsaken by one who pledged his
   honor! Forsaken by a friend so long tried and trusted! Forsaken by a
   dear relative! Forsaken by father and mother! Forsaken by all! This is
   woe indeed, and yet it may be patiently borne if the Lord will take us
   up.

   But what must it be to feel forsaken of God? Think of that bitterest of
   cries, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Have we ever in any
   degree tasted the wormwood and the gall of "Forsaken," in that sense?
   If so, let us beseech our Lord to save us from any repetition of so
   unspeakable a sorrow. Oh, that such darkness may never return! Men in
   malice said of a saint, "God hath forsaken him; persecute and take
   him." But it was always false. The Lord's loving favor shall compel our
   cruel foes to eat their own words, or, at least, to hold their tongues.

   The reverse of all this is that superlative word, Hephzibah -- "the
   Lord delighteth in thee." This turns weeping into dancing. Let those
   who dreamed that they were forsaken hear the Lord say, "I will never
   leave thee nor forsake thee.''

  WHAT SANCTIFIES OUR OFFERINGS?

   "And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
   of sweet incense before the Lord" Lev. 4:7

   The altar of incense is the place where saints present their prayers
   and praises; and it is delightful to think of it as sprinkled with the
   blood of the great sacrifice. This it is which makes all our worship
   acceptable with Jehovah: He sees the blood of His own Son, and
   therefore accepts our homage.

   It is well for us to fix our eyes upon the blood of the one offering
   for sin. Sin mingles even with our holy things, and our best
   repentance, faith, prayer, and thanksgiving could not be received of
   God were it not for the merit of the atoning sacrifice. Many sneer at
   "the blood"; but to us it is the foundation of comfort and hope. That
   which is on the horns of the altar is meant to be prominently before
   our eyes when we draw near to God. The blood gives strength to prayer,
   and hence it is on the altar's horns. It is "before the Lord," and
   therefore it ought to be before us. It is on the altar before we bring
   the incense; it is there to sanctify our offerings and gifts.

   Come, let us pray with confidence, since the Victim is offered, the
   merit has been pleaded, the blood is within the veil, and the prayers
   of believers must be sweet unto the Lord.

   "I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it" Rev. 3:8

   Saints who remain faithful to the truth of God have an open door before
   them. My soul, thou hast resolved to live and die by that which the
   Lord has revealed in His Word, and therefore before thee stands this
   open door.

   I will enter in by the open door of communion with God. Who shall say
   me nay? Jesus has removed my sin, and given me His righteousness,
   therefore I may freely enter. Lord, I do so by thy grace.

   I have also before me an open door into the mysteries of the Word. I
   may enter into the deep things of God. Election, Union to Christ, the
   Second Advent -- all these are before me, and I may enjoy them. No
   promise and no doctrine are now locked up against me.

   An open door of access is before me in private, and an open door of
   usefulness in public. God will hear me; God will use me. A door is
   opened for my onward march to the church above, and for my daily
   fellowship with saints below. Some may try to shut me up or shut me
   out, but all in vain.

   Soon shall I see an open door into Heaven: the pearl gate will be my
   way of entrance, and then I shall go in unto my Lord and King, and be
   with God eternally shut in.

   "And I will strengthen them in the Lord: and they shall walk up and
   down in his name, saith the Lord" Zech. 10:12

   A solace for sick saints. They have grown faint, and they fear that
   they shall never rise from the bed of doubt and fear; but the great
   Physician can both remove the disease, and take away the weakness which
   has come of it. He will strengthen the feeble. This He will do in the
   best possible way, for it shall be "in Jehovah." Our strength is far
   better in God than in self. In the Lord it causes fellowship, in
   ourselves it would create pride. In ourselves it would be sadly
   limited, but in God it knows no bound.

   When strength is given, the believer uses it. He walks up and down in
   the name of the Lord. What an enjoyment it is to walk abroad after
   illness, and what a delight to be strong in the Lord after a season of
   prostration! The Lord gives His people liberty to walk up and down, and
   an inward leisure to exercise that liberty. He makes gentlemen of us:
   we are not slaves who know no rest, and see no sights, but we are free
   to travel at our ease throughout Immanuel's land.

   Come, my heart, be thou no more sick and sorry, Jesus bids thee be
   strong, and walk with God in holy contemplation. Obey His word of love.

   "And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy
   seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
   soul, that thou mayest live" Deut. 30:6

   Here we read of the true circumcision.

   Note the author of it: "The Lord thy God." He alone can deal
   effectually with our heart, and take away its carnality and pollution.
   To make us love God with all our heart and soul is a miracle of grace
   which only the Holy Ghost can work. We must look to the Lord alone for
   this and never be satisfied with anything short of it.

   Note where this circumcision is wrought. It is not of the flesh, but of
   the spirit. It is the essential mark of the covenant of grace. Love to
   God is the indelible token of the chosen seed; by this secret seal the
   election of grace is certified to the believer. We must see to it that
   we trust in no outward ritual, but are sealed in heart by the operation
   of the Holy Ghost.

   Note what the result is -- "that thou mayest live." To be carnally
   minded is death. In the overcoming of the flesh we find life and peace.
   If we mind the things of the Spirit, we shall live. Oh, that Jehovah,
   our God, may complete His gracious work upon our inner natures, that in
   the fullest and highest sense we may live unto the Lord.

  IF, AND A TRIPLE PROMISE

   "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
   and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will
   I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their
   land" II Chron. 7:14

   Called by the name of the Lord, we are nevertheless erring men and
   women. What a mercy it is that our God is ready to forgive! Whenever we
   sin let us hasten to the mercy-seat of our God, seeking pardon.

   We are to humble ourselves. Should we not be humbled by the fact that
   after receiving so much love we yet transgress? O Lord, we bow before
   thee in the dust, and own our grievous ingratitude. Oh, the infamy of
   sin! Oh, the sevenfold infamy of it in persons so favored as we have
   been!

   Next, we are to pray for mercy, for cleansing, for deliverance from the
   power of sin. O Lord, hear us even now, and shut not out our cry.

   In this prayer we are to seek the Lord's face. He has left us because
   of our faults, and we must entreat Him to return. O Lord, look on us in
   thy Son Jesus, and smile upon thy servants.

   With this must go our own turning from evil, God cannot turn to us
   unless we turn from sin.

   Then comes the triple promise of hearing, pardon, and healing. Our
   Father, grant us these at once for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake.

   Oct. 14


   "Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess
   also before my Father which is in heaven" Matt. 10:32

   Gracious promise! It is a great Joy to me to confess my Lord. Whatever
   my faults may be, I am not ashamed of Jesus, nor do I fear to declare
   the doctrines of His cross. O Lord, I have not hid thy righteousness
   within my heart.

   Sweet is the prospect which the text sets before me! Friends forsake
   and enemies exult, but the Lord does not disown His servant. Doubtless
   my Lord will own me even here, and give me new tokens of His favorable
   regard. But there comes a day when I must stand before the great
   Father. What bliss to think that Jesus will confess me then! He will
   say, "This man truly trusted me, and was willing to be reproached for
   my name's sake; and therefore I acknowledge him as mine." The other day
   a great man was made a knight, and the Queen handed him a jeweled
   garter; but what of that? It will be an honor beyond all honors for the
   Lord Jesus to confess us in the presence of the divine Majesty in the
   Heavens. Never let me be ashamed to own my Lord. Never let me indulge a
   cowardly silence, or allow a fainthearted compromise. Shall I blush to
   own Him who promises to own me?

   Oct. 15


   "As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he
   that eateth me, even he shall live by me" John 6:57

   We live by virtue of our union with the Son of God. As God-man
   Mediator, the Lord Jesus lives by the self-existent Father who has sent
   Him, and in the same manner we live by the Saviour who has quickened
   us. He who is the source of our life is also the sustenance of it.
   Living is sustained by feeding. We must support the spiritual life by
   spiritual food, and that spiritual food is the Lord Jesus. Not His
   life, or death, or offices, or work, or word alone, but Himself, as
   including all these. On Jesus, Himself, we feed.

   This is set forth to us in the Lord's Supper, but it is actually
   enjoyed by us when we meditate upon our Lord, believe in Him with
   appropriating faith, take Him into ourselves by love, and assimilate
   Him by the power of the inner life. We know what it is to feed on
   Jesus, but we cannot speak it or write it. Our wisest course is to
   practice it, and to do so more and more. We are entreated to eat
   abundantly, and it will be to our infinite profit to do so when Jesus
   is our meat and our drink.

   Lord, I thank thee that this, which is a necessity of my new life, is
   also its greatest delight. So, I do at this hour feed on thee.

   Oct. 16


   "Because I live, ye shall live also" John 14:19

   Jesus has made the life of believers in Him as certain as His own. As
   sure as the Head lives the members live also. If Jesus has not risen
   from the dead, then are we dead in our sins; but since He has risen,
   all believers are risen in Him. His death has put away our
   transgressions, and loosed the bonds which held us under the death
   sentence. His resurrection proves our justification: we are absolved,
   and mercy saith, "The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die."

   Jesus has made the life of His people as eternal as His own. How can
   they die as long as He lives, seeing they are one with Him? Because He
   dieth no more, and death hath no more dominion over Him, so they shall
   no more return to the graves of their old sins, but shall live unto the
   Lord in newness of life. O believer, when, under great temptation, thou
   fearest that thou shalt one day fall by the hand of the enemy, let this
   reassure thee. Thou shalt never lose thy spiritual life, for it is hid
   with Christ in God. Thou dost not doubt the immortality of thy Lord;
   therefore, do not think that He will let thee die, since thou art one
   with Him. The argument for thy life is His life, and of that thou canst
   have no fear; wherefore rest in thy living Lord.

   Oct. 17


   "He that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded" Prov. 13:13

   Holy awe of God's Word is at a great discount. Men think themselves
   wiser than the Word of the Lord, and sit in judgment upon it. "So did
   not I, because of the fear of God." We accept the inspired Book as
   infallible, and prove our esteem by our obedience. We have no terror of
   the Word, but we have a filial awe of it. We are not in fear of its
   penalties, because we have a fear of its commands.

   This holy fear of the commandment produces the restfulness of humility,
   which is far sweeter than the recklessness of pride. It becomes a guide
   to us in our movements; a drag when we are going down-hill, and a
   stimulus when we are climbing it. Preserved from evil and led into
   righteousness by our reverence of the command, we gain a quiet
   conscience, which is a well of wine; a sense of freedom from
   responsibility, which is as life from the dead; and a confidence of
   pleasing God, which is Heaven below. The ungodly may ridicule our deep
   reverence for the Word of the Lord; but what of that? The prize of our
   high calling is a sufficient consolation for us. The rewards of
   obedience make us scorn the scorning of the scorner.

   Oct. 18

  TEARS, THEN JOYFUL HARVEST

   "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy" Ps. 126:5

   Weeping times are suitable for sowing: we do not want the ground to be
   too dry. Seed steeped in the tears of earnest anxiety will come up all
   the sooner. The salt of prayerful tears will give the good seed a
   flavor which will preserve it from the worm: truth spoken in awful
   earnestness has a double life about it. Instead of stopping our sowing
   because of our weeping, let us redouble our efforts because the season
   is so propitious.

   Our heavenly seed could not fitly be sown laughing. Deep sorrow and
   concern for the souls of others are a far more fit accompaniment of
   godly teaching than anything like levity. We have heard of men who went
   to war with a light heart, but they were beaten; and it is mostly so
   with those who sow in the same style.

   Come, then, my heart, sow on in thy weeping, for thou hast the promise
   of a joyful harvest. Thou shalt reap. Thou, thyself, shalt see some
   result of thy labor. This shall come to thee in so large a measure as
   to give thee joy, which a poor, withered, and scanty harvest would not
   do. When thine eyes are dim with silver tears, think of the golden
   corn. Bear cheerfully the present toil and disappointment; for the
   harvest day will fully recompense thee.

   Oct. 19


   "I will correct thee in measure" Jer. 30:11

   To be left uncorrected would be a fatal sign: it would prove that the
   Lord had said, "He is given unto idols, let him alone." God grant that
   such may never be our portion! Uninterrupted prosperity is a thing to
   cause fear and trembling. As many as God tenderly loves He rebukes and
   chastens: those for whom He has no esteem He allows to fatten
   themselves without fear, like bullocks for the slaughter. It is in love
   that our heavenly Father uses the rod upon His children.

   Yet see, the correction is "in measure": He gives us love without
   measure, but chastisement "in measure." As under the old law no
   Israelite could receive more than the "forty stripes save one, which
   ensured careful counting and limited suffering, so is it with each
   afflicted member of the household of faith--every stroke is counted. It
   is the measure of wisdom, the measure of sympathy, the measure of love,
   by which our chastisement is regulated. Far be it from us to rebel
   against appointments so divine. Lord, if thou standest by to measure
   the bitter drops into my cup, it is for me cheerfully to take that cup
   from thy hand, and drink according to thy directions, saying "Thy will
   be done."

   Oct. 20


   "He shall save his people from their sins" Matt. 1:21

   Lord, save me from my sins. By thy name of Jesus I am encouraged thus
   to pray. Save me from my past sins, that the habit of them may not hold
   me captive. Save me from my constitutional sins, that I may not be the
   slave of my own weaknesses. Save me from the sins which are continually
   under my eye that I may not lose my horror of them. Save me from secret
   sins; sins unperceived by me from my want of light. Save me from sudden
   and surprising sins: let me not be carried off my feet by a rush of
   temptation. Save me, Lord, from every sin. Let not any iniquity have
   dominion over me."

   Thou alone canst do this. I cannot snap my own chains or slay my own
   enemies. Thou knowest temptation, for thou wast tempted. Thou knowest
   sin, for thou didst bear the weight of it. Thou knowest how to succor
   me in my hour of conflict; thou canst save me from sinning, and save me
   when I have sinned. It is promised in thy very name that thou wilt do
   this, and I pray thee let me this day verify the prophecy. Let me not
   give way to temper, or pride, or despondency, or any form of evil; but
   do thou save me unto holiness of life, that thy name of Jesus may be
   glorified in me abundantly.

  GOD'S MULTIPLICATION TABLE

   "A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation:
   I the Lord will hasten it in his time" Isa. 60:22

   Works for the Lord often begin on a small scale, and they are none the
   worse for this. Feebleness educates faith, brings God near, and wins
   glory for His name. Prize promises of increase! Mustard seed is the
   smallest among seeds, and yet it becomes a tree-like plant, with
   branches which lodge the birds of Heaven. We may begin with one, and
   that "a little one," and yet it will "become a thousand." The Lord is
   great at the multiplication table. How often did He say to His lone
   servant, "I will multiply thee!" Trust in the Lord, ye ones and twos;
   for He will be in the midst of you if you are gathered in His name.

   "A small one." What can be more despicable in the eyes of those who
   count heads and weigh forces! Yet this is the nucleus of a great
   nation. Only one star shines out at first in the evening, but soon the
   sky is crowded with countless lights.

   Nor need we think the prospect of increase to be remote, for the
   promise is, "I Jehovah will hasten it in his time." There will be no
   premature haste, like that which we see at excited meetings; it will be
   all in due time; but yet there will be no delay. When the Lord hastens,
   His speed is glorious.

   Oct. 22


   "Thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house
   of thy servant be blessed for ever" II Sam. 7:29

   This is a promise pleaded, and so it yields double instruction to us.
   Anything which the Lord God has spoken we should receive as surely
   true, and then plead it at the throne.

   Oh, how sweet to quote what our own God has spoken! How precious to use
   a "therefore" which the promise suggests, as David does in this verse!

   We do not pray because we doubt, but because we believe. To pray
   unbelievingly is unbecoming in the Lord's children. No, Lord, we cannot
   doubt thee: we are persuaded that every word of thine is a sure
   foundation for the boldest expectation. We come to thee and say, "Do as
   thou hast said." Bless thy servants house. Heal our sick; save our
   hesitating ones; restore those who wander; confirm those who live in
   thy fear. Lord, give us food and raiment according to thy word. Prosper
   our undertakings; especially succeed our endeavors to make known thy
   gospel in our neighborhood. Make our servants thy servants, our
   children thy children. Let the blessing flow on to future generations,
   and as long as any of our race remains on earth may they remain true to
   thee. O Lord God "let the house of thy servant be blessed."

  HARVEST OF LIGHT, GLADNESS

   "Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
   heart" Ps. 97:11

   Righteousness is often costly to the man who keeps to it at all
   hazards, but in the end it will bear its own expenses, and return an
   infinite profit. A holy life is like sowing seed: much is going out,
   and apparently it is buried in the soil, never to be gathered up again.
   We are mistaken when we look for an immediate harvest; but the error is
   very natural, for it seems impossible to bury light. Yet light is
   "sown," says the text. It lies latent: none can see it, it is sown. We
   are quite sure that it must one day manifest itself.

   Full sure are we that the Lord has set a harvest for the sowers of
   light, and they shall reap it, each man for himself. Then shall come
   their gladness. Sheaves of joy for seeds of light. Their heart was
   upright before the Lord, though men gave them no credit for it, but
   even censured them: they were righteous, though those about them
   denounced them as censorious. They had to wait, as husbandmen wait for
   the precious fruits of the earth: but the light was sown for them, and
   gladness was being prepared on their behalf by the Lord of the harvest.

   Courage, brothers! we need not be in a hurry. Let us in patience
   possess our souls, for soon shall our souls possess light and gladness.

   Oct. 24


   "And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brazen wall: and they
   shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for
   I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord' Jer.
   15:20

   Stability in the fear and faith of God will make a man like a wall of
   brass, which no one can batter down or break. Only the Lord can make
   such; but we need such men in the church, and in the world, but
   specially in the pulpit.

   Against uncompromising men of truth this age of shams will fight tooth
   and nail. Nothing seems to offend Satan and his seed like decision.
   They attack holy firmness even as the Assyrians besieged fenced cities.
   The joy is that they cannot prevail against those whom God has made
   strong in His strength. Carried about with every wind of doctrine,
   others only need to be blown upon, and away they go; but those who love
   the doctrines of grace, because they possess the grace of the
   doctrines, stand like rocks in the midst of raging seas.

   Whence this stability? "I am with thee, saith the Lord": that is the
   true answer. Jehovah will save and deliver faithful souls from all the
   assaults of the adversary. Hosts are against us, but the Lord of hosts
   is with us. We dare not budge an inch; for the Lord Himself holds us in
   our place, and there we will abide for ever.

  GOD FIRST, THEN EXTRAS

   "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
   these things shall be added unto you" Matt. 6:33

   See how the Bible opens: "In the beginning God." Let your life open in
   the same way. Seek with your whole soul, first and foremost, the
   kingdom of God, as the place of your citizenship, and His righteousness
   as the character of your life. As for the rest, it will come from the
   Lord Himself without your being anxious concerning it. All that is
   needful for this life and godliness "shall be added unto you."

   What a promise this is! Food, raiment, home, and so forth, God
   undertakes to add to you while you seek Him. You mind His business, and
   He will mind yours. If you want paper and string, you get them given in
   when you buy more important goods; and just so all that we need of
   earthly things we shall have thrown in with the kingdom. He who is an
   heir of salvation shall not die of starvation; and he who clothes his
   soul with the righteousness of God cannot be left of the Lord with a
   naked body. Away with carking care. Set all your mind upon seeking the
   Lord. Covetousness is poverty, and anxiety is misery: trust in God is
   an estate, and likeness to God is a heavenly inheritance. Lord, I seek
   thee, be found of me.

   "For the elect's sake those days be shortened" Matt. 24:22

   For the sake of His elect the Lord withholds many judgments, and
   shortens others. In great tribulations the fire would devour all were
   it not that out of regard to His elect the Lord damps the flame. Thus,
   while He saves His elect for the sake of Jesus, He also preserves the
   race for the sake of His chosen.

   What an honor is thus put upon saints! How diligently they ought to use
   their influence with their Lord! He will hear their prayers for
   sinners, and bless their efforts for their salvation. He blesses
   believers that they may be a blessing to those who are in unbelief.
   Many a sinner lives because of the prayers of a mother, or wife, or
   daughter, to whom the Lord has respect.

   Have we used aright the singular power with which the Lord entrusts us?
   Do we pray for our country, for other lands, and for the age? Do we, in
   times of war, famine, pestilence, stand out as intercessors, pleading
   that the days may be shortened? Do we lament before God the outbursts
   of infidelity, error, and licentiousness? Do we beseech our Lord Jesus
   to shorten the reign of sin by hastening His own glorious appearing?
   Let us get to our knees, and never rest till Christ appeareth.

  HIS SERVICE, FACE, NAME

   "His servants shall serve him: and they shall see his face; and his
   name shall be in their foreheads" Rev. 22:3, 4

   Three choice blessings will be ours in the glory land.

   "His servants shall serve him." No other lords shall oppress us, no
   other service shall distress us. We shall serve Jesus always,
   perfectly, without weariness, and without error. This is Heaven to a
   saint: in all things to serve the Lord Christ, and to be owned by Him
   as His servant is our soul's high ambition for eternity.

   "And they shall see his face." This makes the service delightful:
   indeed, it is the present reward of service. We shall know our Lord,
   for we shall see Him as He is. To see the face of Jesus is the utmost
   favor that the most faithful servant of the Lord can ask. What more
   could Moses ask than -- "Let me see thy face"?

   "And his name shall be in their foreheads." They gaze upon their Lord
   till His name is photographed upon their brows. They are acknowledged
   by Him, and they acknowledge Him. The secret mark of inward grace
   develops into the public sign-manual of confessed relationship.

   O Lord, give us these three things in their beginnings here, that we
   may possess them in their fullness in thine own abode of bliss!

   Oct. 28


   "And it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance" Num. 15:25

   Because of our ignorance we are not fully aware of our sins of
   ignorance. Yet we may be sure they are many, in the form both of
   commission and omission. We may be doing in all sincerity, as a service
   to God, that which He has never commanded, and can never accept.

   The Lord knows these sins of ignorance every one. This may well alarm
   us, since in justice He will require these trespasses at our hand; but
   on the other hand, faith spies comfort in this fact, for the Lord will
   see to it that stains unseen by us shall yet be washed away. He sees
   the sin that He may cease to see it by casting it behind His back.

   Our great comfort is that Jesus, the true priest, has made atonement
   for all the congregation of the children of Israel. That atonement
   secures the pardon of unknown sins. His precious blood cleanses us from
   all sin. Whether our eyes have seen it and wept over it, or not, God
   has seen it, Christ has atoned for it, the Spirit bears witness to the
   pardon of it, and so we have a three-fold peace.

   O my Father, I praise thy divine knowledge, which not only perceives my
   iniquities, but provides an atonement which delivers me from the guilt
   of them, even before I know that I am guilty.

   Oct. 29


   "And I will put a division between my people and thy people: tomorrow
   shall this sign be" Exod. 8:23

   Pharoah has a people, and the Lord has a people. These may dwell
   together, and seem to fare alike, but there is a division between them,
   and the Lord will make it apparent. Not for ever shall one event happen
   alike to all, but there shall be great difference between the men of
   the world and the people of Jehovah's choice.

   This may happen in the time of judgments, when the Lord becomes the
   sanctuary of His saints. It is very conspicuous in the conversion of
   believers when their sin is put away, while unbelievers remain under
   condemnation. From that moment they become a distinct race, come under
   a new discipline, and enjoy new blessings. Their homes, henceforth, are
   free from the grievous swarms of evils which defile and torment the
   Egyptians. They are kept from the pollution of lust, the bite of care,
   the corruption of falsehood, and the cruel torment of hatred, which
   devour many families.

   Rest assured, tried believer, that though you have your troubles you
   are saved from swarms of worse ones, which infest the homes and hearts
   of the servants of the world's Prince. The Lord has put a division; see
   to it that you keep up the division in spirit, aim, character and
   company.

   "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from
   all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you" Ezek.
   36:25

   What an exceeding joy is this! He who has purified us with the blood of
   Jesus will also cleanse us by the water of the Holy Spirit. God hath
   said it, and so it must be, "Ye shall be clean." Lord, we feel and
   mourn our uncleanness, and it is cheering to be assured by thine own
   mouth that we shall be clean. Oh, that thou wouldst make a speedy work
   of it!

   He will deliver us from our worst sins. The uprisings of unbelief, and
   the deceitful lusts which war against the soul, the vile thoughts of
   pride, and the suggestions of Satan to blaspheme the sacred name -- all
   these shall be so purged away as never to return.

   He will also cleanse us from all our idols, whether of gold or of clay:
   our impure loves, and our excessive love of that which in itself is
   pure. That which we have idolized shall either be broken from us, or we
   shall be broken off from it.

   It is God who speaks of what He Himself will do. Therefore is this word
   established and sure, and we may boldly look for that which it
   guarantees to us. Cleansing is a covenant blessing, and the covenant is
   ordered in all things and sure.

   "I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord" Ps.
   118:17

   A fair assurance this! It was no doubt based upon a promise, inwardly
   whispered in the Psalmist's heart, which he seized upon and enjoyed. Is
   my case like that of David? Am I depressed because the enemy affronts
   me? Are there multitudes against me, and few on my side? Does unbelief
   bid me lie down and die in despair -- a defeated, dishonored man? Do my
   enemies begin to dig my grave?

   What then? Shall I yield to the whisper of fear, and give up the
   battle, and with it give up all hope? Far from it. There is life in me
   yet: "I shall not die." Vigor will return and remove my weakness: "I
   shall live." The Lord lives, and I shall live also. My mouth shall
   again be opened: "I shall declare the works of Jehovah." Yes, and I
   shall speak of the present trouble as another instance of the
   wonder-working faithfulness and love of the Lord my God. Those who
   would gladly measure me for my coffin had better wait a bit; for "the
   Lord hath chastened me sore, but he hath not given me over unto death."
   Glory be to His name for ever! I am immortal till my work is done. Till
   the Lord wills it no vault can close upon me.

   "Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it" I Thess. 5:24

   What will He do? He will sanctify us wholly. See the previous verse. He
   will carry on the work of purification till we are perfect in every
   part. He will preserve our "whole spirit, and soul, and body, blameless
   unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." He will not allow us to fall
   from grace, nor come under the dominion of sin. What great favors are
   these! Well may we adore the giver of such unspeakable gifts.

   Who will do this? The Lord who has called us out of darkness into His
   marvelous light, out of death in sin into eternal life in Christ Jesus.
   Only He can do this: such perfection and preservation can only come
   from the God of all grace.

   Why will He do it? Because He is "faithful" -- faithful to His own
   promise which is pledged to save the believer; faithful to His Son,
   whose reward it is that His people shall be presented to Him faultless;
   faithful to the work which He has commenced in us by our effectual
   calling. It is not their own faithfulness, but the Lord's own
   faithfulness, on which the saints rely.

   Come, my soul, here is a grand feast to begin a dull month with. There
   may be fogs without, but there should be sunshine within.

   Nov. 2


   "No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly" Ps.
   84:11

   Many pleasing things the Lord may withhold, but "no good thing." He is
   the best judge of what is good for us. Some things are assuredly good,
   and these we may have for the asking through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   Holiness is a good thing, and this He will work in us freely. Victory
   over evil tendencies, strong tempers, and evil habits, He will gladly
   grant, and we ought not to remain without it.

   Full assurance He will bestow, and near communion with Himself, and
   access into all truth, and boldness with prevalence at the mercy seat.
   If we have not these, it is from want of faith to receive, and not from
   any unwillingness of God to give. A calm, a heavenly frame, great
   patience, and fervent love -- all these will He give to holy diligence.

   But note well that we must "walk uprightly." There must be no cross
   purposes and crooked dealings; no hypocrisy nor deceit. If we walk
   foully God cannot give us favors, for that would be a premium upon sin.
   The way of uprightness is the way of heavenly wealth -- wealth so large
   as to include every good thing.

   What a promise to plead in prayer! Let us get to our knees.

   Nov. 3

  IN GOD'S TIME

   "For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall
   speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will
   surely come, it will not tarry" Hab. 2:3

   Mercy may seem slow, but it is sure. The Lord in unfailing wisdom has
   appointed a time for the outgoings of His gracious power, and God's
   time is the best time. We are in a hurry; the vision of the blessing
   excites our desire, and hastens our longings; but the Lord will keep
   His appointments. He never is before His time; He never is behind.

   God's word is here spoken of as a living thing which will speak, and
   will come. It is never a dead letter, as we are tempted to fear when we
   have long watched for its fulfillment. The living word is on the way
   from the living God, and though it may seem to linger, it is not in
   reality doing so. God's train is not behind time. It is only a matter
   of patience, and we shall soon see for ourselves the faithfulness of
   the Lord. No promise of His shall fail; "it will not lie." No promise
   of His will be lost in silence; "it shall speak." What comfort it will
   speak to the believing ear! No promise of His shall need to be renewed
   like a bill which could not be paid on the day in which it fell due --
   "it will not tarry."

   Come, my soul, canst thou not wait for thy God? Rest in Him and be
   still in unutterable peacefulness.

   "And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.
   For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see
   rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink,
   both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts" II Kings 3:16, 17

   Three armies were perishing of thirst, and the Lord interposed.
   Although He sent neither cloud nor rain, yet He supplied an abundance
   of water. He is not dependent upon ordinary methods, but can surprise
   His people with novelties of wisdom and power. Thus are we made to see
   more of God than ordinary processes could have revealed. Although the
   Lord may not appear for us in the way we expect, or desire, or suppose,
   yet He will in some way or other provide for us. It is a great blessing
   for us to be raised above looking to secondary causes, so that we may
   gaze into the face of the great First Cause.

   Have we this day grace enough to make trenches into which the divine
   blessing may flow? Alas! We too often fail in the exhibition of true
   and practical faith. Let us this day be on the outlook for answers to
   prayer. As the child who went to a meeting to pray for rain took an
   umbrella with her; so let us truly and practically expect the Lord to
   bless us. Let us make the valley full of ditches and expect to see them
   all filled.

   "I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wrath: for the
   spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made" Isa.
   57:16

   Our heavenly Father seeks our instruction, not our destruction. His
   contention with us has a kind intention toward us. He will not be
   always in arms against us. We think the Lord is long in His
   chastisements, but that is because we are short in our patience. His
   compassion endureth for ever, but not His contention. The night may
   drag its weary length along, but it must in the end give place to
   cheerful day. As contention is only for a season, so the wrath which
   leads to it is only for a small moment. The Lord loves His chosen too
   well to be always angry with them.

   If He were to deal with us always as He does sometimes we should faint
   outright, and go down hopelessly to the gates of death. Courage, dear
   heart! The Lord will soon end His chiding. Bear up, for the Lord will
   bear you up, and bear you through. He who made you knows how frail you
   are, and how little you can bear. He will handle tenderly that which He
   has fashioned so delicately. Therefore, be not afraid because of the
   painful present, for it hastens to a happy future. He that smote you
   will heal you; His little wrath shall be followed by great mercies.

   Nov. 6


   "Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires
   of thine heart" Ps. 37:4

   Delight in God has a transforming power, and lifts a man above the
   gross desires of our fallen nature. Delight in Jehovah is not only
   sweet in itself, but it sweetens the whole soul, till the longings of
   the heart become such that the Lord can safely promise to fulfill them.
   Is not that a grand delight which moulds our desires till they are like
   the desires of God?

   Our foolish way is to desire, and then set to work to compass what we
   desire. We do not go to work in God's way, which is to seek Him first,
   and then expect all things to be added unto us. If we will let our
   heart be filled with God till it runs over with delight, then the Lord
   Himself will take care that we shall not want any good thing. Instead
   of going abroad for joys let us stay at home with God, and drink waters
   out of our own fountain. He can do for us far more than all our
   friends. It is better to be content with God alone than to go about
   fretting and pining for the paltry trifles of time and sense. For a
   while we may have disappointments; but if these bring us nearer to the
   Lord, they are things to be prized exceedingly, for they will in the
   end secure to us the fulfillment of all our right desires.

   Nov. 7


   "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted" Luke 18:14

   It ought not to be difficult for us to humble ourselves, for what have
   we to be proud of? We ought to take the lowest place without being told
   to do so. If we are sensible and honest we shall be little in our own
   eyes. Especially before the Lord in prayer we shall shrink to nothing.
   There we cannot speak of merit, for we have none: our one and only
   appeal must be to mercy: "God be merciful to me a sinner."

   Here is a cheering word from the throne. We shall be exalted by the
   Lord if we humble ourselves. For us the way upward is downhill. When we
   are stripped of self we are clothed with humility, and this is the best
   of wear. The Lord will exalt us in peace and happiness of mind; He will
   exalt us into knowledge of His Word and fellowship with Himself; He
   will exalt us in the enjoyment of sure pardon and justification. The
   Lord puts His honors upon those who can wear them to the honor of the
   Giver. He gives usefulness, acceptance, and influence to those who will
   not be puffed up by them, but will be abased by a sense of greater
   responsibility. Neither God nor man will care to lift up a man who
   lifts up himself; but both God and good men unite to honor modest
   worth.

   O Lord, sink me in self that I may rise in thee.

   Nov. 8


   "My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in
   weakness" II Cor. 12:9

   Our weakness should be prized as making room for divine strength. We
   might never have known the power of grace if we had not felt the
   weakness of nature. Blessed be the Lord for the thorn in the flesh, and
   the messenger of Satan, when they drive us to the strength of God.

   This is a precious word from our Lord's own lip. It has made the writer
   laugh for joy. God's grace enough for me! I should think it is. Is not
   the sky enough for the bird, and the ocean enough for the fish? The
   All-Sufficient is sufficient for my largest want. He who is sufficient
   for earth and Heaven is certainly able to meet the case of one poor
   worm like me.

   Let us, then, fall back upon our God and His grace. If He does not
   remove our grief He will enable us to bear it. His strength shall be
   poured into us till the worm shall thresh the mountains; and a nothing
   shall be victor over all the high and mighty ones. It is better for us
   to have God's strength than our own; for if we were a thousand times as
   strong as we are, it would all amount to nothing in the face of the
   enemy; and if we could be weaker than we are, which is scarcely
   possible, yet we could do all things through Christ.

   Nov. 9


   "Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that
   they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord God"
   Ezek. 34:30

   To be the Lord's own people is a choice blessing, but to know that we
   are such is a comfortable blessing. It is one thing to hope that God is
   with us, and another thing to know that He is so. Faith saves us, but
   assurance satisfies us. We take God to be our God when we believe in
   Him; but we get the joy of Him when we know that He is ours, and that
   we are His. No believer should be content with hoping and trusting, he
   should ask the Lord to lead him on to full assurance, so that matters
   of hope may become matters of certainty.

   It is when we enjoy covenant blessings, and see our Lord Jesus raised
   up for us as a plant of renown, that we come to a clear knowledge of
   the favor of God toward us. Not by law, but by grace, do we learn that
   we are the Lord's people. Let us always turn our eyes in the direction
   of free grace. Assurance of faith can never come by the works of the
   law. It is an evangelical virtue, and can only reach us in a gospel
   way. Let us not look within. Let us look to the Lord alone. As we see
   Jesus we shall see our salvation.

   Lord, send us such a flood-tide of thy love that we shall be washed
   beyond the mire of doubt and fear.

   Nov. 10


   "He will not suffer thy foot to be moved" Ps. 121:3

   If the Lord will not suffer it, neither men nor devils can do it. How
   greatly would they rejoice if they could give us a disgraceful fall,
   drive us from our position, and bury us out of memory! They could do
   this to their heart's content were it not for one hindrance, and only
   one: the Lord will not suffer it; and if He does not suffer it, we
   shall not suffer it.

   The way of life is like traveling among the Alps. Along mountain paths
   one is constantly exposed to the slipping of the foot. Where the way is
   high the head is apt to swim, and then the feet soon slide: there are
   spots which are smooth as glass, and others that are rough with loose
   stones, and in either of these a fall is hard to avoid. He who
   throughout life is enabled to keep himself upright and to walk without
   stumbling has the best of reasons for gratitude. What with pitfalls and
   snares, weak knees, weary feet, and subtle enemies, no child of God
   would stand fast for an hour were it not for the faithful love which
   will not suffer his foot to be moved. "Amidst a thousand snares I stand
   Upheld and guarded by thy hand; That hand unseen shall hold me still,
   And lead me to thy holy hill."

   Nov. 11

  THE LORD'S FREE MEN

   "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
   law, but under grace" Rom. 6:14

   Sin will reign if it can: it cannot be satisfied with any place below
   the throne of the heart. We sometimes fear that it will conquer us, and
   then we cry unto the Lord, "Let not any iniquity have dominion over
   me." This is His comforting answer, "Sin shall not have dominion over
   you. It may assail you, and even wound you; but it shall never
   establish sovereignty over you."

   If we were under the law, our sin would gather strength and hold us
   under its power; for it is the punishment of sin that a man comes under
   the power of sin. As we are under the covenant of grace, we are secured
   against departing from the living God by the sure declaration of the
   covenant. Grace is promised to us, by which we are restored from our
   wanderings, cleansed from our impurities, and set free from the chains
   of habit.

   We might lie down in despair and be "content to serve the Egyptians" if
   we were still as slaves working for eternal life; but since we are the
   Lord's free men, we take courage to fight with our corruptions and
   temptations, being assured that sin shall never bring us under its sway
   again. God Himself giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ,
   to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   Nov. 12


   "My people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord" Jer.
   31:14

   Note the "my" which comes twice: "My people shall be satisfied with my
   goodness."

   The kind of people who are satisfied with God are marked out as God's
   own. He is pleased with them, for they are pleased with Him. They call
   Him their God, and He calls them His people; He is satisfied to take
   them for a portion, and they are satisfied with Him for their portion.
   There is a mutual communion of delight between God's Israel and
   Israel's God.

   These people are satisfied. This is a grand thing. Very few of the sons
   of men are ever satisfied, let their lot be what it may; they have
   swallowed the horse-leech, and it continually cries, "Give! Give!" Only
   sanctified souls are satisfied souls. God Himself must both convert us
   and content us.

   It is no wonder that the Lord's people should be satisfied with the
   goodness of their Lord. Here is goodness without mixture, bounty
   without stint, mercy without chiding, love without change, favor
   without reserve. If God's goodness does not satisfy us, what will?
   What! Are we still groaning? Surely there is a wrong desire within if
   it be one which God's goodness does not satisfy.

   Lord, I am satisfied. Blessed be thy name.

   Nov. 13


   "Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep" Ps.
   121:4

   Jehovah is "the Keeper of Israel." No form of unconsciousness ever
   steals over Him, neither the deeper slumber nor the slighter sleep. He
   never fails to watch the house and the heart of His people. This is a
   sufficient reason for our resting in perfect peace. Alexander said that
   he slept because his friend Parmenio watched; much more may we sleep
   because our God is our guard.

   "Behold" is here set up to call our attention to the cheering truth.
   Israel, when he had a stone for his pillow, fell asleep; but his God
   was awake, and came in vision to His servant. When we lie defenseless,
   Jehovah Himself will cover our head.

   The Lord keeps His people as a rich man keeps his treasure, as a
   captain keeps a city with a garrison, as a sentry keeps watch over his
   sovereign. None can harm those who are in such keeping. Let me put my
   soul into His dear hands. He never forgets us, never ceases actively to
   care for us, never finds Himself unable to preserve us.

   O my Lord, keep me, lest I wander and fall and perish. Keep me, that I
   may keep thy commandments. By thine unslumbering care prevent my
   sleeping like the sluggard, and perishing like those who sleep the
   sleep of death.

   Nov. 14


   "If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it" John 14:14

   What a wide promise! Anything! Whether large or small, all my needs are
   covered by that word "anything." Come, my soul, be free at the mercy
   seat, and hear thy Lord saying to thee, "Open thy mouth wide, and I
   will fill it."

   What a wise promise! We are always to ask in the name of Jesus. While
   this encourages us, it also honors Him. This is a constant plea.
   Occasionally every other plea is darkened, especially such as we could
   draw from our own relation to God, or our experience of His grace; but
   at such times the name of Jesus is as mighty at the throne as ever, and
   we may plead it with full assurance.

   What an instructive prayer! I may not ask for anything to which I
   cannot put Christ's hand and seal. I dare not use my Lord's name to a
   selfish or willful petition. I may only use my Lord's name to prayers
   which He would Himself pray if He were in my case. It is a high
   privilege to be authorized to ask in the name of Jesus as if Jesus
   Himself asked; but our love to Him will never allow us to set that name
   where He would not have set it.

   Am I asking for that which Jesus approves? Dare I put His seal to my
   prayer? Then I have that which I seek of the Father.

   Nov. 15


   "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus" Phil. 4:19

   Paul's God is our God, and will supply all our need. Paul felt sure of
   this in reference to the Philippians, and we feel sure of it as to
   ourselves. God will do it, for it is like Him: He loves us, He delights
   to bless us, and it will glorify Him to do so. His pity, His power, His
   love, His faithfulness, all work together that we be not famished.

   What a measure doth the Lord go by: "According to his riches in glory
   by Christ Jesus." The riches of His grace are large, but what shall we
   say of the riches of His glory? His "riches of glory by Christ Jesus,"
   who shall form an estimate of this? According to this immeasurable
   measure will God fill up the immense abyss of our necessities. He makes
   the Lord Jesus the receptacle and the channel of His fullness, and then
   He imparts to us His wealth of love in its highest form. Hallelujah!

   The writer knows what it is to be tried in the work of the Lord.
   Fidelity has been recompensed with anger, and liberal givers have
   stopped their subscriptions; but he whom they sought to oppress has not
   been one penny the poorer, nay, rather he has been the richer; for this
   promise has been true, "My God shall supply all our need." God's
   supplies are surer than any bank.

   "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue
   that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn" Isa. 54:17

   There is great clatter in the forges and smithies of the enemy. They
   are making weapons wherewith to smite the saints. They could not even
   do as much as this if the Lord of saints did not allow them; for He has
   created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire. But see how
   busily they labor! How many swords and spears they fashion! It matters
   nothing, for on the blade of every weapon you may read this
   inscription: It shall not prosper.

   But now listen to another noise: it is the strife of tongues. Tongues
   are more terrible instruments than can be made with hammers and anvils,
   and the evil which they inflict cuts deeper and spreads wider. What
   will become of us now? Slander, falsehood, insinuation, ridicule --
   these are poisoned arrows; how can we meet them? The Lord God promises
   us that, if we cannot silence them, we shall, at least, escape from
   being ruined by them. They condemn us for the moment, but we shall
   condemn them at last, and for ever. The mouth of them that speak lies
   shall be stopped, and their falsehoods shall be turned to the honor of
   those good men who suffered by them.

   "For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his
   inheritance" Ps. 94:14

   No, nor will He cast even so much as one of them. Man has his
   cast-offs, but God has none; for His choice is unchangeable, and His
   love is everlasting. None can find out a single person whom God has
   forsaken after having revealed Himself savingly to him.

   This grand truth is mentioned in the psalm to cheer the heart of the
   afflicted. The Lord chastens His own; but He never forsakes them. The
   result of the double work of the law and the rod is our instruction,
   and the fruit of that instruction is a quieting of spirit, a sobriety
   of mind, out of which comes rest. The ungodly are let alone till the
   pit is digged into which they will fall and be taken; but the godly are
   sent to school to be prepared for their glorious destiny hereafter.
   Judgment will return and finish its work upon the rebels, but it will
   equally return to vindicate the sincere and godly. Hence we may bear
   the rod of chastisement with calm submission; it means not anger, but
   love.


   "God may chasten and correct,

   But He never can neglect;

   May in faithfulness reprove,

   But He ne'er can cease to love."

   Nov. 18


   "In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he
   that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house
   of David shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them" Zech.
   12:8

   One of the best methods of the Lord's defending His people is to make
   them strong in inward might. Men are better than walls, and faith is
   stronger than castles.

   The Lord can take the feeblest among us and make him like David, the
   champion of Israel. Lord, do this with me! Infuse thy power into me,
   and fill me with sacred courage that I may face the giant with sling
   and stone, confident in God.

   The Lord can make His greatest champions far mightier than they are:
   David can be as God, as the angel of Jehovah. This would be a marvelous
   development, but it is possible, or it would not be spoken of. O Lord,
   work thus with the best of our leaders! Show us what thou art able to
   do -- namely, to raise thy faithful servants to a height of grace and
   holiness which shall be clearly supernatural!

   Lord, dwell in thy saints, and they shall be as God; put thy might into
   them, and they shall be as the living creatures who dwell in the
   presence of Jehovah. Fulfill this promise to thine entire church in
   this our day, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   Nov. 19


   "From this day will I bless you" Haggai 2:19

   Future things are hidden from us. Yet here is a glass in which we may
   see the unborn years. The Lord says, "From this day will I bless you."

   It is worth while to note the day which is referred to in this promise.
   There had been failure of crops, blasting, and mildew, and all because
   of the people's sin. Now, the Lord saw these chastened ones commencing
   to obey His word, and build His temple, and therefore He says, "From
   the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid, consider.
   From this day will I bless you." If we have lived in any sin, and the
   Spirit leads us to purge ourselves of it, we may reckon upon the
   blessing of the Lord. His smile, His Spirit, His grace, His fuller
   revelation of His truth will all prove to us an enlarged blessing. We
   may fall into greater opposition from man because of our faithfulness,
   but we shall rise to closer dealings with the Lord our God, and a
   clearer sight of our acceptance in Him.

   Lord, I am resolved to be more true to thee, and more exact in my
   following of thy doctrine and thy precept; and I pray thee, therefore,
   by Christ Jesus, to increase the blessedness of my daily life
   henceforth and for ever.

   Nov. 20


   "For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with
   goodness" Ps. 107:9

   It is well to have longings, and the more intense they are the better.
   The Lord will satisfy soul-longings, however great and all-absorbing
   they may be. Let us greatly long, for God will greatly give. We are
   never in a right state of mind when we are contented with ourselves,
   and are free from longings. Desires for more grace, and groanings which
   cannot be uttered, are growing pains, and we should wish to feel them
   more and more. Blessed Spirit, make us sigh and cry after better
   things, and for more of the best things!

   Hunger is by no means a pleasant sensation. Yet blessed are they that
   hunger and thirst after righteousness. Such persons shall not only have
   their hunger relieved with a little food, but they shall be filled.
   They shall not be filled with any sort of rough stuff, but their diet
   shall be worthy of their good Lord, for they shall be filled with
   goodness by Jehovah Himself.

   Come, let us not fret because we long and hunger, but let us hear the
   voice of the Psalmist as he also longs and hungers to see God
   magnified. "Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and
   for his wonderful works to the children of men."

   Nov. 21

  THE OUTWARD, UPWARD LOOK

   "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am
   God, and there is none else" Isa. 45:22

   This is a promise of promises. It lies at the foundation of our
   spiritual life. Salvation comes through a look at Him who is "a just
   God and a Saviour." How simple is the direction! "Look unto me. How
   reasonable is the requirement! Surely the creature should look to the
   Creator. We have looked elsewhere long enough, it is time that we look
   alone to Him who invites our expectation, and promises to give us His
   salvation.

   Only a look! Will we not look at once? We are to bring nothing in
   ourselves, but to look outward and upward to our Lord on His throne,
   whither He has gone up from the cross. A look requires no preparation,
   no violent effort: it needs neither wit nor wisdom, wealth nor
   strength. All that we need is in the Lord our God, and if we look to
   Him for everything, that everything shall be ours, and we shall be
   saved.

   Come, far-off ones, look hither! Ye ends of the earth, turn your eyes
   this way! As from the furthest regions men may see the sun and enjoy
   his light, so you who lie in death's borders at the very gates of hell
   may by a look receive the light of God, the life of Heaven, the
   salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God, and therefore able to
   save.

   Nov. 22


   "In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of
   Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of
   Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I
   reserve" Jer. 50:20

   A glorious word indeed! What a perfect pardon is here promised to the
   sinful nations of Israel and Judah! Sin is to be so removed that it
   shall not be found, so blotted out that there shall be none. Glory be
   unto the God of pardons!

   Satan seeks out sins wherewith to accuse us, our enemies seek them that
   they may lay them to our charge, and our own conscience seeks them even
   with a morbid eagerness. But when the Lord applies the precious blood
   of Jesus, we fear no form of search, for "there shall be none," "they
   shall not be found." The Lord hath caused the sins of His people to
   cease to be: He hath finished transgression, and made an end of sin.
   The sacrifice of Jesus has cast our sins into the depths of the sea.
   This makes us dance for joy.

   The reason for the obliteration of sin lies in the fact that Jehovah
   Himself pardons His chosen ones. His word of grace is not only royal,
   but divine. He speaks absolution, and we are absolved. He applies the
   atonement, and from that hour His people are beyond all fear of
   condemnation. Blessed be the name of the sin-annihilating God!

   Nov. 23


   "The Lord thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and
   little" Deut. 7:22

   We are not to expect to win victories for the Lord Jesus by a single
   blow. Evil principles and practices die hard. In some places it takes
   years of labor to drive out even one of the many vices which defile the
   inhabitants. We must carry on the war with all our might, even when
   favored with little manifest success.

   Our business in this world is to conquer it for Jesus. We are not to
   make compromises, but to exterminate evils. We are not to seek
   popularity, but to wage unceasing war with iniquity. Infidelity,
   popery, drink, impurity, oppression, worldliness, error; these are all
   to be "put out."

   The Lord our God can alone accomplish this. He works by His faithful
   servants; and, blessed be His name, He promises that He will so work.
   "Jehovah thy God will put out those nations before thee." This He will
   do by degrees, that we may learn perseverance, may increase in faith,
   may earnestly watch, and may avoid carnal security. Let us thank God
   for a little success, and pray for more. Let us never sheathe the sword
   till the whole land is won for Jesus.

   Courage, my heart! Go on little by little, for many littles will make a
   great whole.

   Nov. 24


   "He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever" Ps.
   103:9

   He will chide sometimes, or He would not be a wise Father for such poor
   erring children as we are. His chiding is very painful to those who are
   true, because they feel how sadly they deserve it, and how wrong it is
   on their part to grieve Him. We know what this chiding means, and we
   bow before the Lord, mourning that we should cause Him to be angry with
   us.

   But what a comfort we find in these lines! "Not always" will He chide.
   If we repent and turn to Him with hearts broken for sin and broken from
   sin, He will smile upon us at once. It is no pleasure to Him to turn a
   frowning face toward those whom He loves with all His heart: it is His
   joy that our joy should be full.

   Come, let us seek His face. There is no reason for despair, nor even
   for despondency. Let us love a chiding God, and before long we shall
   sing: "Thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me." Begone, ye
   dark forebodings, ye ravens of the soul! Come in, ye humble hopes and
   grateful memories, ye doves of the heart! He who pardoned us long ago
   as a judge, will again forgive us as a father, and we shall rejoice in
   His sweet, unchanging love.

   Nov. 25


   "Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a
   plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings,
   crying, Grace, grace unto it" Zech. 4:7

   At this hour a mountain of difficulty, distress, or necessity, may be
   in our way, and natural reason sees no path over it, or through it, or
   round it. Let faith come in, and straightway the mountain disappears
   and becomes a plain. But faith must first hear the word of the Lord --
   "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of
   hosts." This grand truth is a prime necessity for meeting the
   insurmountable trials of life.

   I see that I can do nothing, and that all reliance on man is vanity.
   "Not by might." I see that no visible means can be relied on, but the
   force is in the invisible Spirit. God alone must work, and men and
   means must be nothing accounted of. If it be so, that the Almighty God
   takes up the concerns of His people, then great mountains are nothing.
   He can remove worlds as boys toss balls about, or drive them with their
   foot. This power He can lend to me. If the Lord bids me move an Alp I
   can do it through His name. It may be a great mountain, but even before
   my feebleness it shall become a plain; for the Lord hath said it. What
   can I be afraid of with God on my side?

   Nov. 26


   "Your sorrow shall be turned into joy" John 16:20

   Their particular sorrow was the death and absence of their Lord, and it
   was turned into joy when He rose from the dead and showed Himself in
   their midst. All the sorrows of saints shall be thus transmuted; even
   the worst of them, which look as if they must for ever remain fountains
   of bitterness.

   Then the more sorrow the more joy. If we have loads of sorrow, then the
   Lord's power will turn them into tons of joy. Then the bitterer the
   trouble the sweeter the pleasure: the swinging of the pendulum far to
   the left will cause it to go all the farther to the right. The
   remembrance of the grief shall heighten the flavor of the delight: we
   shall set the one in contrast with the other, and the brilliance of the
   diamond shall be the more clearly seen because of the black foil behind
   it.

   Come, my heart, cheer up! In a little while I shall be as glad as I am
   now gloomy. Jesus tells me that by a heavenly alchemy my sorrow shall
   be turned into joy. I do not see how it is to be, but I believe it, and
   I begin to sing by way of anticipation. This depression of spirit is
   not for long, I shall soon be up among the happy ones who praise the
   Lord day and night, and there I shall sing of the mercy which delivered
   me out of great afflictions.

   Nov. 27


   "And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee
   rest" Ex. 33:14

   Precious promise! Lord, enable me to appropriate it as all my own.

   We must go at certain times from our abode, for here we have no
   continuing city. It often happens that when we feel most at home in a
   place, we are suddenly called away from it. Here is the antidote for
   this ill. The Lord Himself will keep us company. His presence, which
   includes His favor, His fellowship, His care, and His power, shall be
   ever with us in every one of our marchings. This means far more than it
   says; for, in fact, it means all things. If we have God present with
   us, we have possession of Heaven and earth. Go with me, Lord, and then
   command me where thou wilt!

   But we hope to find a place of rest. The text promises it. We are to
   have rest of God's own giving, making, and preserving. His presence
   will cause us to rest even when we are on the march, yea, even in the
   midst of battle. Rest! Thrice blessed word. Can it ever be enjoyed by
   mortals? Yes, there is the promise, and by faith we plead it. Rest
   comes from the Comforter, from the Prince of Peace, and from the
   glorious Father who rested on the seventh day from all His works. To be
   with God is to rest in the most emphatic sense.

   Nov. 28


   "The Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and
   in all that thou settest thine hand unto" Deut. 28:8

   If we obey the Lord our God He will bless that which He gives us.
   Riches are no curse when blessed of the Lord. When men have more than
   they require for their immediate need, and begin to lay up in
   store-houses, the dry rot of covetousness or the blight of
   hard-heartedness is apt to follow the accumulation; but with God's
   blessing it is not so. Prudence arranges the saving, liberality directs
   the spending, gratitude maintains consecration, and praise sweetens
   enjoyment. It is a great mercy to have God's blessing in one's iron
   safe, and on one's banking account.

   What a favor is made ours by the last clause! "The Lord shall bless
   thee in all that thou settest thine hand unto." We would not put our
   hand to anything upon which we dare not ask God's blessing, neither
   would we go about it without prayer and faith. But what a privilege to
   be able to look for the Lord's help in every enterprise! Some talk of a
   lucky man: the blessing of the Lord is better than luck. The patronage
   of the great is nothing to the favor of God. Self-reliance is all very
   well; but the Lord's blessing is infinitely more than all the fruit of
   talent, genius, or tact.

   Nov. 29


   "He that believeth shall not make haste" Isa. 28:16

   He shall make haste to keep the Lord's commandments; but he shall not
   make haste in any impatient or improper sense.

   He shall not haste to run away, for he shall not be overcome with the
   fear which causes panic. When others are flying hither and thither as
   if their wits had failed them, the believer shall be quiet, calm, and
   deliberate, and so shall be able to act wisely in the hour of trial.

   He shall not haste in his expectations, craving his good things at once
   and on the spot; but he will wait God's time. Some are in a desperate
   hurry to have the bird in the hand; for they regard the Lord's promise
   as a bird in the bush, not likely to be theirs. Believers know how to
   wait.

   He shall not haste by plunging into wrong or questionable action.
   Unbelief must be doing something, and thus it works its own undoing;
   but faith makes no more haste than good speed, and thus it is not
   forced to go back sorrowfully by the way which it followed heedlessly.

   How is it with me? Am I believing, and am I therefore keeping to the
   believer's pace, which is walking with God? Peace, fluttering spirit!
   Oh, rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him! Heart, see that thou
   do this at once!

   Nov. 30


   "The Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he
   will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be
   dismayed" Deut. 31:8

   In the presence of a great work or a great warfare, here is a text
   which should help us to buckle on our harness. If Jehovah Himself goes
   before us, it must be safe to follow. Who can obstruct our progress if
   the Lord Himself is in the van? Come, brother soldiers, let us make a
   prompt advance! Why do we hesitate to pass on to victory?

   Nor is the Lord before us only; He is with us. Above, beneath, around,
   within is the omnipotent, omnipresent One. In all time, even to
   eternity, He will be with us even as He has been. How this should nerve
   our arm! Dash at it boldly, ye soldiers of the cross, for the Lord of
   hosts is with us!

   Being before us and with us, He will never withdraw His help. He cannot
   fail in Himself, and He will not fail toward us. He will continue to
   help us according to our need, even to the end. As He cannot fail us,
   so He will not forsake us. He will always be both able and willing to
   grant us strength and succor till fighting days are gone.

   Let us not fear nor be dismayed; for the Lord of hosts will go down to
   the battle with us, will bear the brunt of the fight, and give us the
   victory.

   "He that walketh uprightly walketh surely" Prov. 10:9

   His walk may be slow, but it is sure. He that hasteth to be rich shall
   not be innocent nor sure; but steady perseverance in integrity, if it
   do not bring riches, will certainly bring peace. In doing that which is
   just and right we are like one walking upon a rock, for we have
   confidence that every step we take is upon solid and safe ground. On
   the other hand, the utmost success through questionable transactions
   must always be hollow and treacherous, and the man who has gained it
   must always be afraid that a day of reckoning will come, and then his
   gains will condemn him.

   Let us stick to truth and righteousness. By God's grace let us imitate
   our Lord and Master, in whose mouth no deceit was ever found. Let us
   not be afraid of being poor, nor of being treated with contempt. Never,
   on any account whatever, let us do that which our conscience cannot
   justify. If we lose inward peace, we lose more than a fortune can buy.
   If we keep in the Lord's own way, and never sin against our conscience,
   our way is sure against all comers. Who is he that can harm us if we be
   followers of that which is good? We may be thought fools by fools if we
   are firm in our integrity; but in the place where judgment is
   infallible we shall be approved.

   Dec. 2


   "I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand,
   I shall not be moved" Ps. 16:8

   This is the way to live. With God always before us, we shall have the
   noblest companionship, the holiest example, the sweetest consolation,
   and the mightiest influence. This must be a resolute act of the mind.
   "I have set," and it must be maintained as a set and settled thing.
   Always to have an eye to the Lord's eye, and an ear for the Lord's
   voice -- this is the right state for the godly man. His God is near
   him, filling the horizon of his vision, leading the way of his life,
   and furnishing the theme of his meditation. What vanities we should
   avoid, what sins we should overcome, what virtues we should exhibit,
   what joys we should experience if we did indeed set the Lord always
   before us! Why not?

   This is the way to be safe. The Lord being ever in our minds, we come
   to feel safety and certainty because of His being so near. He is at our
   right hand to guide and aid us; and hence we are not moved by fear, nor
   force, nor fraud, nor fickleness. When God stands at a man's right
   hand, that man is himself sure to stand. Come on, then, ye foemen of
   the truth! Rush against me like a furious tempest, if ye will. God
   upholds me. God abides with me. Whom shall I fear?

   Dec. 3


   "I will make them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts
   to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the
   wilderness, and sleep in the woods" Ezek. 34:25

   It is the height of grace that Jehovah should be in covenant with man,
   a feeble, sinful and dying creature. Yet the Lord has solemnly entered
   into a faithful compact with us, and from that covenant He will never
   turn aside. In virtue of this covenant we are safe. As lions and wolves
   are driven off by shepherds, so shall all noxious influences be chased
   away. The Lord will give us rest from disturbers and destroyers; the
   evil beasts shall cease out of the land. O Lord, make this thy promise
   good even now!

   The Lord's people are to enjoy security in places of the greatest
   exposure: wildernesses and woods are to be as pastures and folds to the
   flock of Christ. If the Lord does not change the place for the better,
   He will make us the better in the place. The wilderness is not a place
   to dwell in, but the Lord can make it so; in the woods one feels bound
   to watch rather than to sleep, and yet the Lord giveth His beloved
   sleep even there. Nothing without or within should cause any fear to
   the child of God. By faith the wilderness can become the suburbs of
   Heaven, and the woods the vestibule of glory.

   "He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
   trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler" Ps. 91:4

   A condescending simile indeed! Just as a hen protects her brood and
   allows them to nestle under her wings, so will the Lord defend His
   people, and permit them to hide away in Him. Have we not seen the
   little chicks peeping out from under the mother's feathers? Have we not
   heard their little cry of contented joy? In this way let us shelter
   ourselves in our God, and feel overflowing peace in knowing that He is
   guarding us.

   While the Lord covers us we trust. It would be strange if we did not.
   How can we distrust when Jehovah Himself becomes house and home, refuge
   and rest to us?

   This done, we go out to war in His name and enjoy the same guardian
   care. We need shield and buckler, and when we implicitly trust God,
   even as the chick trusts the hen, we find His truth arming us from head
   to foot. The Lord cannot lie; He must be faithful to His people; His
   promise must stand. This sure truth is all the shield we need. Behind
   it we defy the fiery darts of the enemy.

   Come, my soul, hide under those great wings, lose thyself among those
   soft feathers! How happy thou art!

   Dec. 5


   "He shall dwell on high: his place of defense shall be the munitions of
   rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure" Isa. 33:16

   The man to whom God has given grace to be of blameless life dwells in
   perfect security.

   He dwells on high, above the world, out of gunshot of the enemy, and
   near to Heaven. He has high aims and motives, and he finds high
   comforts and company. He rejoices in the mountains of eternal love,
   wherein he has his abode.

   He is defended by munitions of stupendous rock. The firmest things in
   the universe are the promises and purposes of the unchanging God, and
   these are the safeguard of the obedient believer.

   He is provided for by this great promise, "Bread shall be given him."
   As the enemy cannot climb the fort, nor break down the rampart, so the
   fortress cannot be captured by siege and famine. The Lord, who rained
   manna in the wilderness, will keep His people in good store even when
   they are surrounded by those who would starve them.

   But what if water should fail? That cannot be, "his waters shall be
   sure." There is a never-failing well within the impregnable fortress.
   The Lord sees that nothing is wanting. None can touch the citizen of
   the true Zion. However fierce the enemy, the Lord will preserve His
   chosen.

   Dec. 6

  "THROUGH" NOT ENGULFED

   "When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
   the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the
   fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon
   thee" Isa. 43:2

   Bridge there is none: we must go through the waters, and feel the rush
   of the rivers. The presence of God in the flood is better than a
   ferry-boat. Tried we must be, but triumphant we shall be; for Jehovah
   Himself, who is mightier than many waters, shall be with us. Whenever
   else He may be away from His people, the Lord will surely be with them
   in difficulties and dangers. The sorrows of life may rise to an
   extraordinary height, but the Lord is equal to every occasion.

   The enemies of God can put in our way dangers of their own making,
   namely, persecutions and cruel mockings, which are like a burning fiery
   furnace. What then? We shall walk through the fires. God being with us,
   we shall not be burned; nay, not even the smell of fire shall remain
   upon us.

   Oh, the wonderful security of the heaven-born and heaven-bound pilgrim!
   Floods cannot drown him, nor fires burn him. Thy presence, O Lord, is
   the protection of thy saints from the varied perils of the road.
   Behold, in faith I commit myself unto thee, and my spirit enters into
   rest.

  GIFT OF STRENGTH; PEACE TO BLESS

   "The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his
   people with peace" Ps. 29:11

   David had just heard the voice of the Lord in a thunderstorm, and had
   seen His power in the hurricane whose path he had described; and now,
   in the cool calm after the storm, that overwhelming power by which
   Heaven and earth are shaken is promised to be the strength of the
   chosen. He who wings the unerring bolt will give to His redeemed the
   wings of eagles; He who shakes the earth with His voice will terrify
   the enemies of His saints, and give His children peace. Why are we weak
   when we have divine strength to flee to? Why are we troubled when the
   Lord's own peace is ours? Jesus, the mighty God, is our strength; let
   us put Him on and go forth to our service. Jesus, our blessed Lord, is
   also our peace; let us repose in Him this day, and end our fears. What
   a blessing to have Him for our strength and peace both now and for
   ever!

   That same God who rides upon the storm in days of tempest will also
   rule the hurricane of our tribulation, and send us, before long, days
   of peace. We shall have strength for storms, and songs for fair
   weather. Let us begin to sing at once unto God our strength and our
   peace. Away, dark thoughts! Up, faith and hope!

   Dec. 8


   "If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall
   also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor" John
   12:26

   The highest service is imitation. If I would be Christ's servant I must
   be His follower. To do as Jesus did is the surest way of bringing honor
   to His name. Let me mind this every day.

   If I imitate Jesus I shall have His company: if I am like Him I shall
   be with Him. In due time He will take me up to dwell with Him above,
   if, meanwhile, I have striven to follow Him here below. After His
   suffering our Lord came to His throne, and even so, after we have
   suffered a while with Him here below, we also shall arrive in glory.
   The issue of our Lord's life shall be the issue of ours: if we are with
   Him in His humiliation we shall be with Him in His glory. Come, my
   soul, pluck up courage, and put down thy feet in the blood-marked
   footprints which thy Lord has left thee.

   Let me not fail to note that the Father will honor those who follow His
   Son. If He sees me true to Jesus He will put marks of favor and honor
   upon me for His Son's sake. No honor can be like this. Princes and
   emperors bestow the mere shadows of honor; the substance of glory comes
   from the Father. Wherefore, my soul, cling thou to thy Lord Jesus more
   closely than ever.

   Dec. 9

  THE "ALL" OF BELIEF

   "Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to
   him that believeth" Mark 9:23

   Our unbelief is the greatest hindrance in our way; in fact, there is no
   other real difficulty as to our spiritual progress and prosperity. The
   Lord can do everything; but when He makes a rule that according to our
   faith so shall it be unto us, our unbelief ties the hands of His
   Omnipotence.

   Yes, the confederacies of evil shall be scattered if we can but
   believe. Despised truth shall lift its head if we will but have
   confidence in the God of truth. We can bear our load of trouble, or
   pass uninjured through the waves of distress, if we can gird our loins
   with the girdle of peace, that girdle which is buckled on by the hands
   of trust.

   What can we not believe? Is everything possible except believing in
   God? Yet He is always true; why do we not believe Him? He is always
   faithful to His word; why can we not trust Him? When we are in a right
   state of heart faith costs no effort: it is then as natural for us to
   rely upon God as for a child to trust its father.

   The worst of it is, that we can believe God about everything except the
   present pressing trial. This is folly. Come, my soul, shake off such
   sinfulness, and trust thy God with the load, the labor, the longing of
   this present. This done, all is done.

   Dec. 10


   "But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then
   I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine
   adversaries" Exod. 23:22

   The Lord Christ in the midst of His people is to be acknowledged and
   obeyed. He is the vicegerent of God, and speaks in the Father's name,
   and it is ours implicitly and immediately to do as He commands. We
   shall lose the promise if we disregard the precept.

   To full obedience how large the blessing! The Lord enters into a league
   with His people, offensive and defensive. He will bless those who bless
   us, and curse those who curse us. God will go heart and soul with His
   people, and enter in deepest sympathy into their position. What a
   protection this affords us! We need not concern ourselves about our
   adversaries, when we are assured that they have become the adversaries
   of God. If Jehovah has taken up our quarrel we may leave the foemen in
   His hands.

   So far as our own interest is concerned we have no enemies; but for the
   cause of truth and righteousness we take up arms and go forth to
   conflict. In this sacred war we are allied with the eternal God, and if
   we carefully obey the law of our Lord Jesus, He is engaged to put forth
   all His power on our behalf. Wherefore we fear no man.

   Dec. 11

  TRUST AND DO; DO AND TRUST

   "Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
   verily thou shalt be fed" Ps. 37:3

   Trust and do are words which go well together, in the order in which
   the Holy Spirit has placed them. We should have faith, and that faith
   should work. Trust in God sets us upon holy doing: we trust God for
   good, and then we do good. We do not sit still because we trust, but we
   arouse ourselves, and expect the Lord to work through us and by us. It
   is not ours to worry and do evil, but to trust and do good. We neither
   trust without doing, nor do without trusting.

   Adversaries would root us out, if they could; but by trusting and doing
   we dwell in the land. We will not go into Egypt, but we will remain in
   Immanuel's land -- the providence of God, the Canaan of covenant love.
   We are not so easily to be got rid of as the Lord's enemies suppose.
   They cannot thrust us out, nor stamp us out: where God has given us a
   name and a place, there we abide.

   But what about the supply of our necessities? The Lord has put a
   "verily" into this promise. As sure as God is true, His people shall be
   fed. It is theirs to trust and to do, and it is the Lord's to do
   according to their trust. If not fed by ravens, or fed by an Obadiah,
   or fed by a widow, yet they shall be fed somehow. Away, ye fears!

   Dec. 12


   "In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength" Isa. 30:15

   It is always weakness to be fretting and worrying, questioning and
   mistrusting. What can we do if we wear ourselves to skin and bone? Can
   we gain anything by fearing and fuming? Do we not unfit ourselves for
   action, and unhinge our minds for wise decision? We are sinking by our
   struggles when we might float by faith.

   Oh, for grace to be quiet! Why run from house to house to repeat the
   weary story which makes us more and more heart-sick as we tell it? Why
   even stay at home to cry out in agony because of wretched forebodings
   which may never be fulfilled? It would be well to keep a quiet tongue,
   but it would be far better if we had a quiet heart. Oh, to be still and
   know that Jehovah is God!

   Oh, for grace to be confident in God! The Holy One of Israel must
   defend and deliver His own. He cannot run back from His solemn
   declarations. We may make sure that every word of His will stand though
   the mountains should depart. He deserves to be confided in; and if we
   would display confidence and consequent quietness, we might be as happy
   as the spirits before the throne.

   Come, my soul, return unto thy rest, and lean thy head upon the bosom
   of the Lord Jesus.

   Dec. 13


   "It shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light" Zech.
   14:7

   It is a surprise that it should be so; for all things threaten that at
   evening time it shall be dark. God is wont to work in a way so much
   above our fears and beyond our hopes, that we are greatly amazed, and
   are led to praise His sovereign grace. No, it shall not be with us as
   our hearts are prophesying: the dark will not deepen into midnight, but
   it will on a sudden brighten into day. Never let us despair. In the
   worst times let us trust in the Lord who turneth the darkness of the
   shadow of death into the morning. When the tale of bricks is doubled
   Moses appears, and when tribulation abounds it is nearest its end.

   This promise should assist our patience. The light may not fully come
   till our hopes are quite spent by waiting all day to no purpose. To the
   wicked the sun goes down while it is yet day: to the righteous the sun
   rises when it is almost night. May we not with patience wait for that
   heavenly light, which may be long in coming, but is sure to prove
   itself well worth waiting for?

   Come, my soul, take up thy parable and sing unto Him who will bless
   thee in life and in death, in a manner surpassing all that nature has
   ever seen when at its best.

   Dec. 14


   "And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new"
   Rev. 21:5

   Glory be to His name! All things need making new, for they are sadly
   battered and worn by sin. It is time that the old vesture was rolled up
   and laid aside, and that creation put on her Sunday suit. But no one
   else can make all things new except the Lord who made them at the
   first; for it needs as much power to make out of evil as to make out of
   nothing. Our Lord Jesus has undertaken the task, and He is fully
   competent for the performance of it. Already He has commenced His
   labor, and for centuries He has persevered in making new the hearts of
   men, and the order of society. By-and-by He will make new the whole
   constitution of human government, and human nature shall be changed by
   His grace; and there shall come a day when the body shall be made new,
   and raised like unto His glorious body.

   What a joy to belong to a kingdom in which everything is being made new
   by the power of its King! We are not dying out: we are hastening on to
   a more glorious life. Despite the opposition of the powers of evil, our
   glorious Lord Jesus is accomplishing His purpose, and making us, and
   all things about us, "new," and as full of beauty as when they first
   came from the hand of the Lord.

   Dec. 15


   "And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears
   into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
   neither shall they learn war any more Isa. 2:4

   Oh, that these happy times were come! At present the nations are
   heavily armed, and are inventing weapons more and more terrible, as if
   the chief end of man could only be answered by destroying myriads of
   his fellows. Yet peace will prevail one day; yes, and so prevail that
   the instruments of destruction shall be beaten into other shapes and
   used for better purposes.

   How will this come about? By trade? By civilization? By arbitration? We
   do not believe it. Past experience forbids our trusting to means so
   feeble. Peace will be established only by the reign of the Prince of
   Peace. He must teach the people by His Spirit, renew their hears by His
   grace, and reign over them by His supreme power, and then will they
   cease to wound and kill. Man is a monster when once his blood is up,
   and only the Lord Jesus can turn this lion into a lamb. By changing
   man's heart, his blood-thirsty passions are removed. Let every reader
   of this book of promises offer special prayer today to the Lord and
   Giver of Peace, that He would speedily put an end to war, and establish
   concord over the whole world.

   Dec. 16


   "Thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots,
   and though they be strong" Joshua 17:18

   It is a great encouragement to valor to be assured of victory, for then
   a man goes forth to war in confidence, and ventures where else he had
   been afraid to go. Our warfare is with evil within us and around us,
   and we ought to be persuaded that we are able to get the victory, and
   that we shall do so in the name of the Lord Jesus. We are not riding
   for a fall, but to win; and win we shall. The grace of God in its
   Omnipotence is put forth for the overthrow of evil in every form: hence
   the certainty of triumph.

   Certain of our sins find chariots of iron in our constitution, our
   former habits, our associations, and our occupations. Nevertheless we
   must overcome them. They are very strong, and in reference to them we
   are very weak; yet in the name of God we must master them, and we will.
   If one sin has dominion of us we are not the Lord's free men. A man who
   is held by only one chain is still a captive. There is no going to
   Heaven with one sin ruling within us, for of the saints it is said,
   "Sin shall not have dominion over you." Up, then, and slay every
   Canaanite, and break to shivers every chariot of iron! The Lord of
   hosts is with us, and who shall resist His sin-destroying power?

   Dec. 17


   "So shall we ever be with the Lord" I Thess. 4:17

   While we are here the Lord is with us, and when we are called away we
   are with Him. There is no dividing the saint from His Saviour. They are
   one, and they always must be one: Jesus cannot be without His own
   people, for He would be a Head without a body. Whether caught up into
   the air, or resting in Paradise, or sojourning here, we are with Jesus;
   and who shall separate us from Him?

   What a joy is this! Our supreme honor, rest, comfort, delight, is to be
   with the Lord. We cannot conceive of anything which can surpass or even
   equal this divine society. By holy fellowship we must be with Him in
   His humiliation, rejection, and travail, and then we shall be with Him
   in His glory. Before long we shall be with Him in His rest and in His
   royalty, in His expectation and in His manifestation. We shall fare as
   He fares, and triumph as He triumphs.

   O my Lord, if I am to be for ever with thee, I have a destiny
   incomparable. I will not envy an archangel. To be for ever with the
   Lord is my idea of Heaven at its best. Not the harps of gold, nor the
   crowns unfading, nor the light unclouded, is glory to me; but Jesus,
   Jesus Himself, and myself for ever with Him in nearest and dearest
   fellowship.

   Dec. 18


   "As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem" Isa. 31:5

   With hurrying wing the mother bird hastens up to the protection of her
   young. She wastes no time upon the road when coming to supply them with
   food, or guard them from danger. Thus as on eagle's wings will the Lord
   come for the defense of His chosen; yea, He will ride upon the wings of
   the wind.

   With outspread wing the mother covers her little ones in the nest. She
   hides them away by interposing her own body. The hen yields her own
   warmth to her chicks, and makes her wings a house, in which they dwell
   at home. Thus doth Jehovah Himself become the protection of His elect.
   He Himself is their refuge, their abode, their all.

   As birds flying, and birds covering (for the word means both), so will
   the Lord be unto us: and this He will be repeatedly and successfully.
   We shall be defended and preserved from all evil: the Lord who likens
   Himself to birds will not be like them in their feebleness, for He is
   Jehovah of hosts. Let this be our comfort, that almighty love will be
   swift to succor, and sure to cover. The wing of God is more quick and
   more tender than the wing of a bird, and we will put our trust under
   its shadow henceforth and for ever.

   Dec. 19

  AFFLICTIONS, BUT NO BROKEN BONES

   "He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken" Ps. 34:20

   This promise by the context is referred to the much afflicted righteous
   man: "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord
   delivereth him out of them all." He may suffer skin-wounds and
   flesh-wounds, but no great harm shall be done, "not a bone of him shall
   be broken."

   This is great comfort to a tried child of God, and comfort which I dare
   accept; for up to this hour I have suffered no real damage from my many
   afflictions. I have neither lost faith, nor hope, nor love. Nay, so far
   from losing these bones of character, they have gained in strength and
   energy. I have more knowledge, more experience, more patience, more
   stability than I had before the trials came. Not even my joy has been
   destroyed. Many a bruise have I had by sickness, bereavement,
   depression, slander, and opposition; but the bruise has healed, and
   there has been no compound fracture of a bone, not even a simple one.
   The reason is not far to seek. If we trust in the Lord, He keeps all
   our bones; and if He keeps them, we may be sure that not one of them is
   broken.

   Come, my heart, do not sorrow. Thou art smarting, but there are no
   bones broken. Endure hardness, and bid defiance to fear.

   Dec. 20

  MEN AS MEN; GOD AS GOD

   "I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
   shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man
   which shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy maker, that
   hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the
   earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the
   oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the
   oppressor?" Isa. 51:12, 13

   Let the text itself be taken as the portion for today. There is no need
   to enlarge upon it. Trembling one, read it, believe it, feed on it, and
   plead it before the Lord. He whom you fear is only a man after all;
   while He who promises to comfort you is God, your Maker, and the
   Creator of Heaven and earth. Infinite comfort more than covers a very
   limited danger.

   "Where is the fury of the oppressor?" It is in the Lord's hand. It is
   only the fury of a dying creature; fury which will end as soon as the
   breath is gone from the nostril. Why, then, should we stand in awe of
   one who is as frail as ourselves? Let us not dishonor our God by making
   a god of puny man. We can make an idol of a man by rendering to him
   excessive fear as well as by paying him inordinate love. Let us treat
   men as men, and God as God; and then we shall go calmly on in the path
   of duty, fearing the Lord, and fearing nobody else.

   Dec. 21


   "He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue
   our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of
   the sea" Micah 7:19

   God never turns from His love, but He soon turns from His wrath. His
   love to His chosen is according to His nature, His anger is only
   according to His office: He loves because He is love, He frowns because
   it is necessary for our good. He will come back to the place in which
   His heart rests, namely, His love to His own, and then He will take
   pity upon our griefs and end them.

   What a choice promise is this -- "He will subdue our iniquities"! He
   will conquer them. They cry to enslave us, but the Lord will give us
   victory over them by His own right hand. Like the Canaanites, they
   shall be beaten, put under the yoke, and ultimately slain.

   As for the guilt of our sins, how gloriously is that removed! "All
   their sins," -- yes, the whole host of them; "thou wilt cast" -- only
   an almighty arm could perform such a wonder; 'into the depths of the
   sea"--where Pharaoh and his chariots went down. Not into the shallows
   out of which they might be washed up by the tide, but into the "depths"
   shall our sins be hurled. They are all gone. They sank into the bottom
   like a stone. Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

   Dec. 22


   "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble" Ps.
   46:1

   A help that is not present when we need it is of small value. The
   anchor which is left at home is of no use to the seaman in the hour of
   storm; the money which he used to have is of no worth to the debtor
   when a writ is out against him. Very few earthly helps could be called
   "very present": they are usually far in the seeking, far in the using,
   and farther still when once used. But as for the Lord our God, He is
   present when we seek Him, present when we need Him, and present when we
   have already enjoyed His aid.

   He is more than "present," He is very present. More present than the
   nearest friend can be, for He is in us in our trouble; more present
   than we are to ourselves, for sometimes we lack presence of mind. He is
   always present, effectually present, sympathetically present,
   altogether present. He is present now if this is a gloomy season. Let
   us rest ourselves upon Him. He is our refuge, let us hide in Him; He is
   our strength, let us array ourselves with Him; He is our help, let us
   lean upon Him; He is our very present help, let us repose in Him now.
   We need not have a moment's care, or an instant's fear. "The Lord of
   hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge."

   Dec. 23


   "And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the
   precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth
   beneath" Deut. 33:13

   We may be rich in such things as Joseph obtained, and we may have them
   in a higher sense. Oh, for "the precious things of heaven!" Power with
   God, and the manifestation of power from God, are most precious. We
   would enjoy the peace of God, the joy of the Lord, the glory of our
   God. The benediction of the three divine Persons in love, and grace,
   and fellowship we prize beyond the most fine gold. The things of earth
   are as nothing in preciousness compared with the things of Heaven.

   "The dew." How precious is this! How we pray and praise, when we have
   the dew! What refreshing, what growth, what perfume, what life there is
   in us when the dew is about! Above all things else, as plants of the
   Lord's own right hand planting, we need the dew of His Holy Spirit.

   "The deep that coucheth beneath." Surely this refers to that unseen
   ocean underground which supplies all the fresh springs which make glad
   the earth. Oh to tap the eternal fountains! This is an unspeakable
   boon; let no believer rest till he possesses it. The all-sufficiency of
   Jehovah is ours for ever. Let us resort to it now.

   Dec. 24


   "Thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee" Deut. 33:29

   That arch-enemy, the devil, is a liar from the beginning; but he is so
   very plausible that, like mother Eve, we are led to believe him. Yet in
   our experience we shall prove him a liar.

   He says that we shall fall from grace, dishonor our profession, and
   perish with the doom of apostates; but, trusting in the Lord Jesus, we
   shall hold on our way and prove that Jesus loses none whom His Father
   gave Him. He tells us that our bread will fail, and we shall starve
   with our children; yet the Feeder of the ravens has not forgotten us
   yet, and He will never do so, but will prepare us a table in the
   presence of our enemies.

   He whispers that the Lord will not deliver us out of the trial which is
   looming in the distance, and he threatens that the last ounce will
   break the camel's back. What a liar he is! For the Lord will never
   leave us, nor forsake us. "Let him deliver him now!" cries the false
   fiend: but the Lord will silence him by coming to our rescue.

   He takes great delight in telling us that death will prove too much for
   us. "How wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?" But there also he
   shall prove a liar unto us, and we shall pass through the river singing
   psalms of glory.

   Dec. 25

  HE CAME; HE IS COMING

   "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come
   in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven" Acts 1:11

   Many are celebrating our Lord's first coming this day; let us turn our
   thoughts to the promise of His second coming. This is as sure as the
   first advent, and derives a great measure of its certainty from it. He
   who came as a lowly man to serve will assuredly come to take the reward
   of His service. He who came to suffer will not be slow in coming to
   reign.

   This is our glorious hope, for we shall share His joy. Today we are in
   our concealment and humiliation, even as He was while here below; but
   when He cometh it will be our manifestation, even as it will be His
   revelation. Dead saints shall live at His appearing. The slandered and
   despised shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
   Then shall the saints appear as kings and priests, and the days of
   their mourning shall be ended. The long rest and inconceivable splendor
   of the millennial reign will be an abundant recompense for the ages of
   witnessing and warring.

   Oh, that the Lord would come! He is coming! He is on the road and
   traveling quickly. The sound of His approach should be as music to our
   hearts! Ring out, ye bells of hope!

   Dec. 26

  GOD ONLY, YOU CAN TRUST

   "Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended
   because of thee, yet will I never be offended" Matt. 26:33

   "Why," cries one, "this is no promise of God." Just so, but it was a
   promise of man, and therefore it came to nothing. Peter thought that he
   was saying what he should assuredly carry out; but a promise which has
   no better foundation than a human resolve will fall to the ground. No
   sooner did temptations arise than Peter denied his Master, and used
   oaths to confirm his denial.

   What is man's word? An earthen pot broken with a stroke. What is your
   own resolve? A blossom, which, with God's care, may come to fruit, but
   which, left to itself, will fall to the ground with the first wind that
   moves the bough.

   On man's word hang only what it will bear.

   On thine own resolve depend not at all.

   On the promise of thy God hang time and eternity, this world and the
   next, thine all and the all of all thy beloved ones.

   This volume is a checkbook for believers, and this page is meant as a
   warning as to what bank they draw upon, and whose signature they
   accept. Rely upon Jesus without limit. Trust not thyself nor any born
   of woman, beyond due bounds; but trust thou only and wholly in the
   Lord.

   Dec. 27


   "For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my
   kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my
   peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee" Isa. 54:10

   One of the most delightful qualities of divine love is its abiding
   character. The pillars of the earth may be moved out of their places,
   but the kindness and the covenant of our merciful Jehovah never depart
   from His people. How happy my soul feels in a firm belief of this
   inspired declaration! The year is almost over, and the years of my life
   are growing few, but time does not change my Lord. New lamps are taking
   the place of the old, perpetual change is on all things; but our Lord
   is the same. Force overturns the hills, but no conceivable power can
   affect the eternal God. Nothing in the past, the present, or the future
   can cause Jehovah to be unkind to me.

   My soul, rest in the eternal kindness of the Lord, who treats thee as
   one near of kin. Remember also the everlasting covenant. God is ever
   mindful of it -- see that thou art mindful of it too. In Christ Jesus
   the glorious God has pledged Himself to thee to be thy God, and to hold
   thee as one of His people. Kindness and covenant -- dwell on these
   words as sure and lasting things which eternity itself shall not take
   from thee.

   "He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" Heb. 13:5

   Several times in the Scriptures the Lord hath said this. He has often
   repeated it, to make our assurance doubly sure. Let us never harbor a
   doubt of it. In itself the promise is specially emphatic. In the Greek
   it has five negatives, each one definitely shutting out the possibility
   of the Lord's ever leaving one of His people so that he can justly feel
   forsaken of his God. This priceless Scripture does not promise us
   exemption from trouble, but it does secure us against desertion. We may
   be called to traverse strange ways, but we shall always have our Lord's
   company, assistance, and provision. We need not covet money, for we
   shall always have our God, and God is better than gold, His favor is
   better than fortune.

   We ought surely to be content with such things as we have, for he who
   has God has more than all the world besides. What can we have beyond
   the Infinite? What more can we desire than Almighty Goodness.

   Come, my heart; if God says He will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,
   be thou much in prayer for grace, that thou mayest never leave thy
   Lord, nor even for a moment forsake His ways.

   Dec. 29


   "And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry
   you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver
   you" Isa. 46:4

   The year is very old, and here is a promise for our aged friends; yes,
   and for us all, as age creeps over us. Let us live long enough, and we
   shall all have hoar hairs; therefore we may as well enjoy this promise
   by the foresight of faith.

   When we grow old our God will still be the I AM, abiding evermore the
   same. Hoar hairs tell of our decay, but He decayeth not. When we cannot
   carry a burden, and can hardly carry ourselves the Lord will carry us.
   Even as in our young days He carried us like lambs in His bosom, so
   will He in our years of infirmity.

   He made us, and He will care for us. When we become a burden to our
   friends, and a burden to ourselves, the Lord will not shake us off, but
   the rather He will take us up and carry and deliver us more fully than
   ever. In many cases the Lord gives His servants a long and calm
   evening. They worked hard all day and wore themselves out in their
   Master's service, and so He said to them, "Now rest in anticipation of
   that eternal Sabbath which I have prepared for you." Let us not dread
   old age. Let us grow old graciously, since the Lord himself is with us
   in fullness of grace.

   Dec. 30


   "Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the
   end" John 13:1

   This fact is essentially a promise; for what our Lord was He is, and
   what He was to those with whom He lived on earth, He will be to all His
   beloved so long as the moon endureth.

   "Having loved": here was the wonder! That He should ever have loved men
   at all is the marvel. What was there in His poor disciples that He
   should love them? What is there in me?

   But when He has once begun to love, it is His nature to continue to do
   so. Love made the saints "his own" -- what a choice title! He purchased
   them with blood and they became His treasure. Being His own, He will
   not lose them. Being His beloved, He will not cease to love them. My
   soul, He will not cease to love thee!

   The text is well as it stands: "to the end," even till His death the
   ruling passion of love to His own reigned in His sacred bosom. It means
   also to the uttermost. He could not love them more: He gave Himself for
   them. Some read it, to perfection. Truly He lavished upon them a
   perfect love, in which there was no flaw nor failure, no unwisdom, no
   unfaithfulness, and no reserve.

   Such is the love of Jesus to each one of His people. Let us sing to our
   Well-beloved a song.

   Dec. 31


   "Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to
   glory" Ps. 73:24

   From day to day and from year to year my faith believes in the wisdom
   and love of God, and I know that I shall not believe in vain. No good
   word of His has ever failed, and I am sure that none shall ever fall to
   the ground.

   I put myself into His hand for guidance. I know not the way that I
   should choose: the Lord shall choose mine inheritance for me. I need
   counsel and advice; for my duties are intricate, and my condition is
   involved. I seek to the Lord, as the High Priest of old looked to his
   Urim and Thummim. The counsel of the infallible God I seek in
   preference to my own judgment or the advice of friends. Glorious
   Jehovah, thou shalt guide me!

   Soon the end will come: a few more years, and I must depart out of this
   world unto the Father. My Lord will be near my bed. He will meet me at
   Heaven's gate: He will welcome me to the glory land. I shall not be a
   stranger in Heaven: my own God and Father will receive me to its
   endless bliss.


   WILL GUIDE ME HERE,

   AND RECEIVE ME HEREAFTER. AMEN.
