INTRODUCTION


   T he Treatise on War, of which the earliest English translation is here
   reprinted, was among the most famous writings of the most illustrious
   writer of his age. Few people now read Erasmus; he has become for the
   world in general a somewhat vague name. Only by some effort of the
   historical imagination is it possible for those who are not professed
   scholars and students to realize the enormous force which he was at a
   critical period in the history of civilization. The free institutions
   and the material progress of the modern world have alike their roots in
   humanism. Humanism as a movement of the human mind culminated in the
   age, and even in a sense in the person, of Erasmus. Its brilliant
   flower was of an earlier period; its fruits developed and matured
   later; but it was in his time, and in him, that the fruit set! The
   earlier sixteenth century is not so romantic as its predecessors, nor
   so rich in solid achievement as others that have followed it. As in
   some orchard when spring is over, the blossom lies withered on the
   grass, and the fruit has long to wait before it can ripen on the
   boughs. Yet here, in the dull, hot midsummer days, is the central and
   critical period of the year's growth.

   The life of Erasmus is accessible in many popular forms as well as in
   more learned and formal works. To recapitulate it here would fall
   beyond the scope of a preface. But in order to appreciate this treatise
   fully it is necessary to realize the time and circumstances in which it
   appeared, and to recall some of the main features of its author's life
   and work up to the date of its composition.

   That date can be fixed with certainty, from a combination of external
   and internal evidence, between the years 1513 and 1515; in all
   probability it was the winter of 1514-15. It was printed in the latter
   year, in the "editio princeps" of the enlarged and rewritten Adagia
   then issued from Froben's great printing-works at Basel. The stormy
   decennate of Pope Julius II had ended in February, 1513. To his
   successor, Giovanni de' Medici, who succeeded to the papal throne under
   the name of Leo X, the treatise is particularly addressed. The years
   which ensued were a time singularly momentous in the history of
   religion, of letters, and of the whole life of the civilized world. The
   eulogy of Leo with which Erasmus ends indicates the hopes then
   entertained of a new Augustan age of peace and reconciliation. The
   Reformation was still capable of being regarded as an internal and
   constructive force, within the framework of the society built up by the
   Middle Ages. The final divorce between humanism and the Church had not
   yet been made. The long and disastrous epoch of the wars of religion
   was still only a dark cloud on the horizon. The Renaissance was really
   dead, but few yet realized the fact. The new head of the Church was a
   lover of peace, a friend of scholars, a munificent patron of the arts.
   This treatise shows that Erasmus, to a certain extent, shared or strove
   to share in an illusion widely spread among the educated classes of
   Europe. With a far keener instinct for that which the souls of men
   required, an Augustinian monk from Wittenberg, who had visited Rome two
   years earlier, had turned away from the temple where a corpse lay
   swathed in gold and half hid in the steam of incense. With a far keener
   insight into the real state of things, Machiavelli was, at just this
   time, composing The Prince.

   In one form or another, the subject of his impassioned pleading for
   peace among beings human, civilized, and Christian, had been long in
   Erasmus's mind. In his most celebrated single work, the Praise of
   Folly, he had bitterly attacked the attitude towards war habitual, and
   evilly consecrated by usage, among kings and popes. The same argument
   had formed the substance of a document addressed by him, under the
   title of Anti-Polemus, to Pope Julius in 1507. Much of the substance,
   much even of the phraseology of that earlier work is doubtless repeated
   here. Beyond the specific reference to Pope Leo, the other notes of
   time in the treatise now before us are few and faint. Allusions to
   Louis XII of France (1498-1515), to Ferdinand the Catholic (1479-1516),
   to Philip, king of Aragon (1504-1516), and Sigismund, king of Poland
   (1506-1548), are all consistent with the composition of the treatise
   some years earlier. At the end of it he promises to treat of the matter
   more largely when he publishes the Anti-Polemus. But this intention was
   never carried into effect. Perhaps Erasmus had become convinced of its
   futility; for the events of the years which followed soon showed that
   the new Augustan age was but a false dawn over which night settled more
   stormily and profoundly than before.

   For ten or a dozen years Erasmus had stood at the head of European
   scholarship. His name was as famous in France and England as in the Low
   Countries and Germany. The age was indeed one of those in which the
   much-abused term of the republic of letters had a real and vital
   meaning. The nationalities of modern Europe had already formed
   themselves; the notion of the Empire had become obsolete, and if the
   imperial title was still coveted by princes, it was under no illusion
   as to the amount of effective supremacy which it carried with it, or as
   to any life yet remaining in the mediaeval doctrine of the unity of
   Christendom whether as a church or as a state. The discovery of the new
   world near the end of the previous century precipitated a revolution in
   European politics towards which events had long been moving, and
   finally broke up the political framework of the Middle Ages. But the
   other great event of the same period, the invention and diffusion of
   the art of printing, had created a new European commonwealth of the
   mind. The history of the century which followed it is a history in
   which the landmarks are found less in battles and treaties than in
   books.

   The earlier life of the man who occupies the central place in the
   literary and spiritual movement of his time in no important way differs
   from the youth of many contemporary scholars and writers. Even the
   illegitimacy of his birth was an accident shared with so many others
   that it does not mark him out in any way from his fellows. His early
   education at Utrecht, at Deventer, at Herzogenbosch; his enforced and
   unhappy novitiate in a house of Augustinian canons near Gouda; his
   secretaryship to the bishop of Cambray, the grudging patron who allowed
   rather than assisted him to complete his training at the University of
   Paris--all this was at the time mere matter of common form. It is with
   his arrival in England in 1497, at the age of thirty-one, that his
   effective life really begins.

   For the next twenty years that life was one of restless movement and
   incessant production. In England, France, the Low Countries, on the
   upper Rhine, and in Italy, he flitted about gathering up the whole
   intellectual movement of the age, and pouring forth the results in that
   admirable Latin which was not only the common language of scholars in
   every country, but the single language in which he himself thought
   instinctively and wrote freely. Between the Adagia of 1500 and the
   Colloquia of 1516 comes a mass of writings equivalent to the total
   product of many fertile and industrious pens. He worked in the cause of
   humanism with a sacred fury, striving with all his might to connect it
   with all that was living in the old and all that was developing in the
   newer world. In his travels no less than in his studies the aspect of
   war must have perpetually met him as at once the cause and the effect
   of barbarism; it was the symbol of everything to which humanism in its
   broader as well as in its narrower aspect was utterly opposed and
   repugnant. He was a student at Paris in the ominous year of the first
   French invasion of Italy, in which the death of Pico della Mirandola
   and Politian came like a symbol of the death of the Italian Renaissance
   itself. Charles VIII, as has often been said, brought back the
   Renaissance to France from that expedition; but he brought her back a
   captive chained to the wheels of his cannon. The epoch of the Italian
   wars began. A little later (1500) Sandro Botticelli painted that
   amazing Nativity which is one of the chief treasures of the London
   National Gallery. Over it in mystical Greek may still be read the
   painter's own words: "This picture was painted by me Alexander amid the
   confusions of Italy at the time prophesied in the Second Woe of the
   Apocalypse, when Satan shall be loosed upon the earth." In November,
   1506, Erasmus was at Bologna, and saw the triumphal entry of Pope
   Julius into the city at the head of a great mercenary army. Two years
   later the league of Cambray, a combination of folly, treachery and
   shame which filled even hardened politicians with horror, plunged half
   Europe into a war in which no one was a gainer and which finally ruined
   Italy: "bellum quo nullum," says the historian, "vel atrocius vel
   diuturnius in Italia post exactos Gothos majores nostri meminerunt." In
   England Erasmus found, on his first visit, a country exhausted by the
   long and desperate struggle of the Wars of the Roses, out of which she
   had emerged with half her ruling class killed in battle or on the
   scaffold, and the whole fabric of society to reconstruct. The Empire
   was in a state of confusion and turmoil no less deplorable and much
   more extensive. The Diet of 1495 had indeed, by an expiring effort
   towards the suppression of absolute anarchy, decreed the abolition of
   private war. But in a society where every owner of a castle, every lord
   of a few square miles of territory, could conduct public war on his own
   account, the prohibition was of little more than formal value. Humanism
   had been introduced by the end of the fifteenth century in some of the
   German universities, but too late to have much effect on the rising
   fury of religious controversy. The very year in which this treatise
   against war was published gave to the world another work of even wider
   circulation and more profound consequences. The famous Epistolae
   Obscurorum Virorum, first published in 1515, and circulated rapidly
   among all the educated readers of Europe, made an open breach between
   the humanists and the Church. That breach was never closed; nor on the
   other hand could the efforts of well-intentioned reformers like
   Melancthon bring humanism into any organic relation with the reformed
   movement. When mutual exhaustion concluded the European struggle,
   civilization had to start afresh; it took a century more to recover the
   lost ground. The very idea of humanism had long before then
   disappeared.

   War, pestilence, the theologians: these were the three great enemies
   with which Erasmus says he had throughout life to contend. It was
   during the years he spent in England that he was perhaps least harassed
   by them. His three periods of residence there--a fourth, in 1517,
   appears to have been of short duration and not marked by any very
   notable incident--were of the utmost importance in his life. During the
   first, in his residence between the years 1497 and 1499 at London and
   Oxford, the English Renaissance, if the name be fully applicable to so
   partial and inconclusive a movement, was in the promise and ardour of
   its brief spring. It was then that Erasmus made the acquaintance of
   those great Englishmen whose names cannot be mentioned with too much
   reverence: Colet, Grocyn, Latimer, Linacre. These men were the makers
   of modern England to a degree hardly realized. They carried the future
   in their hands. Peace had descended upon a weary country; and the
   younger generation was full of new hopes. The Enchiridion Militis
   Christiani, written soon after Erasmus returned to France, breathes the
   spirit of one who had not lost hope in the reconciliation of the Church
   and the world, of the old and new. When Erasmus made his second visit
   to England, in 1506, that fair promise had grown and spread. Colet had
   become dean of Saint Paul's; and through him, as it would appear,
   Erasmus now made the acquaintance of another great man with whom he
   soon formed as close an intimacy, Thomas More.

   His Italian journey followed: he was in Italy nearly three years, at
   Turin, Bologna, Venice, Padua, Siena, Rome. It was in the first of
   these years that Albert DÃ¼rer was also in Italy, where he met Bellini
   and was recognized by the Italian masters as the head of a new
   transalpine art in no way inferior to their own. The year after Erasmus
   left Italy, Botticelli, the last survivor of the ancient world, died at
   Florence.

   Meanwhile, Henry VIII, a prince, young, handsome, generous, pious, had
   succeeded to the throne of England. A golden age was thought to have
   dawned. Lord Mountjoy, who had been the pupil of Erasmus at Paris, and
   with whom he had first come to England, lost no time in urging Henry to
   send for the most brilliant and famous of European scholars, and attach
   him to his court. The king, who had already met and admired him, needed
   no pressing. In the letter which Henry himself wrote to Erasmus
   entreating him to take up his residence in England, the language
   employed was that of sincere admiration; nor was there any conscious
   insincerity in the main motive which he urged. "It is my earnest wish,"
   wrote the king, "to restore Christ's religion to its primitive purity."
   The history of the English Reformation supplies a strange commentary on
   these words.

   But the first few years of the new reign (1509-1513), which coincide
   with the third and longest sojourn of Erasmus in England, were a time
   in which high hopes might not seem unreasonable. While Italy was
   ravaged by war and the rest of Europe was in uneasy ferment, England
   remained peaceful and prosperous. The lust of the eyes and the pride of
   life were indeed the motive forces of the court; but alongside of these
   was a real desire for reform, and a real if very imperfect attempt to
   cultivate the nobler arts of peace, to establish learning, and to
   purify religion. Colet's great foundation of Saint Paul's School in
   1510 is one of the landmarks of English history. Erasmus joined the
   founder and the first high master, Colet and Lily, in composing the
   schoolbooks to be used in it. He had already written, in More's house
   at Chelsea, where pure religion reigned alongside of high culture, the
   Encomium Moriae, in which all his immense gifts of eloquence and wit
   were lavished on the cause of humanism and the larger cause of
   humanity. That war was at once a sin, a scandal, and a folly was one of
   the central doctrines of the group of eminent Englishmen with whom he
   was now associated. It was a doctrine held by them with some ambiguity
   and in varying degrees. In the Utopia (1516) More condemns wars of
   aggression, while taking the common view as to wars of so-called
   self-defence. In 1513, when Henry, swept into the seductive scheme for
   a partition of France by a European confederacy, was preparing for the
   first of his many useless and inglorious continental campaigns, Colet
   spoke out more freely. He preached before the court against war itself
   as barbarous and unchristian, and did not spare either kings or popes
   who dealt otherwise. Henry was disturbed; he sent for Colet, and
   pressed him hard on the point whether he meant that all wars were
   unjustifiable. Colet was in advance of his age, but not so far in
   advance of it as this. He gave some kind of answer which satisfied the
   king. The preparations for war went forward; the Battle of Spurs
   plunged the court and all the nation into the intoxication of victory;
   while at Flodden-edge, in the same autumn, the ancestral allies of
   France sustained the most crushing defeat recorded in Scottish history.
   When both sides in a war have invoked God's favour, the successful side
   is ready enough to believe that its prayers have been answered and its
   action accepted by God.

   Erasmus was now reader in Greek and professor of divinity at Cambridge;
   but Cambridge was far away from the centre of European thought and of
   literary activities. He left England before the end of the year for
   Basel, where the greater part of his life thenceforth was passed.
   Froben had made Basel the chief literary centre of production for the
   whole of Europe. Through Froben's printing-presses Erasmus could reach
   a wider audience than was allowed him at any court, however favourable
   to pure religion and the new learning. It was at this juncture that he
   made an eloquent and far-reaching appeal, on a matter which lay very
   near his heart, to the conscience of Christendom.

   The Adagia, that vast work which was, at least to his own generation,
   Erasmus's foremost title to fame, has long ago passed into the rank of
   those monuments of literature "dont la reputation s'affermira toujours
   parcequ'on ne les lit guÃ¨re." So far as Erasmus is more than a name for
   most modern readers, it is on slighter and more popular works that any
   direct knowledge of him is grounded on the Colloquies, which only
   ceased to be a schoolbook within living memory, on the Praise of Folly,
   and on selections from the enormous masses of his letters. An Oxford
   scholar of the last generation, whose profound knowledge of humanistic
   literature was accompanied by a gift of terse and pointed expression,
   describes the Adagia in a single sentence, as "a manual of the wit and
   wisdom of the ancient world for the use of the modern, enlivened by
   commentary in Erasmus's finest vein." In its first form, the Adagiorum
   Collectanea, it was published by him at Paris in 1500, just after his
   return from England. In the author's epistle dedicatory to Mountjoy he
   ascribes to him and to Richard Charnock, the prior of Saint Mary's
   College in Oxford, the inspiration of the work. It consists of a series
   of between eight and nine hundred comments in brief essays, each
   suggested by some terse or proverbial phrase from an ancient Latin
   author. The work gave full scope for the display, not only of the
   immense treasures of his learning, but of those other qualities, the
   combination of which raised their author far above all other
   contemporary writers, his keen wit, his copiousness and facility, his
   complete control of Latin as a living language. It met with an
   enthusiastic reception, and placed him at once at the head of European
   men of letters. Edition after edition poured from the press. It was ten
   times reissued at Paris within a generation. Eleven editions were
   published at Strasburg between 1509 and 1521. Within the same years it
   was reprinted at Erfurt, The Hague, Cologne, Mayence, Leyden, and
   elsewhere. The Rhine valley was the great nursery of letters north of
   the Alps, and along the Rhine from source to sea the book spread and
   was multiplied.

   This success induced Erasmus to enlarge and complete his labours. The
   Adagiorum Chiliades, the title of the work in its new form, was part of
   the work of his residence in Italy in the years 1506-9, and was
   published at Venice by Aldus in September, 1508. The enlarged
   collection, to all intents and purposes a new work, consists of no less
   than three thousand two hundred and sixty heads. In a preface, Erasmus
   speaks slightingly of the Adagiorum Collectanea, with that affectation
   from which few authors are free, as a little collection carelessly
   made. "Some people got hold of it," he adds, (and here the affectation
   becomes absolute untruth,) "and had it printed very incorrectly." In
   the new work, however, much of the old disappears, much more is
   partially or wholly recast; and such of the old matter as is retained
   is dispersed at random among the new. In the Collectanea the
   commentaries had all been brief: here many are expanded into
   substantial treatises covering four or five pages of closely printed
   folio.

   The Aldine edition had been reprinted at Basel by Froben in 1513.
   Shortly afterwards Erasmus himself took up his permanent residence
   there. Under his immediate supervision there presently appeared what
   was to all intents and purposes the definitive edition of 1515. It is a
   book of nearly seven hundred folio pages, and contains, besides the
   introductory matter, three thousand four hundred and eleven headings.
   In his preface Erasmus gives some details with regard to its
   composition. Of the original Paris work he now says, no doubt with
   truth, that it was undertaken by him hastily and without enough method.
   When preparing the Venice edition he had better realized the magnitude
   of the enterprise, and was better fitted for it by reading and
   learning, more especially by the mass of Greek manuscripts, and of
   newly printed Greek first editions, to which he had access at Venice
   and in other parts of Italy. In England also, owing very largely to the
   kindness of Archbishop Warham, more leisure and an ampler library had
   been available.

   Among several important additions made in the edition of 1515, this
   essay, the text of which is the proverbial phrase "Dulce bellum
   inexpertis," is at once the longest and the most remarkable. The adage
   itself, with a few lines of commentary, had indeed been in the original
   collection; but the treatise, in itself a substantial work, now
   appeared for the first time. It occupied a conspicuous place as the
   first heading in the fourth Chiliad of the complete work; and it was at
   once singled out from the rest as of special note and profound import.
   Froben was soon called upon for a separate edition. This appeared in
   April, 1517, in a quarto of twenty pages. This little book, the Bellum
   Erasmi as it was called for the sake of brevity, ran like wildfire from
   reader to reader. Half the scholarly presses of Europe were soon
   employed in reprinting it. Within ten years it had been reissued at
   Louvain, twice at Strasburg, twice at Mayence, at Leipsic, twice at
   Paris, twice at Cologne, at Antwerp, and at Venice. German translations
   of it were published at Basel and at Strasburg in 1519 and 1520. It
   soon made its way to England, and the translation here utilized was
   issued by Berthelet, the king's printer, in the winter of 1533-4.

   Whether the translation be by Richard Taverner, the translator and
   editor, a few years later, of an epitome or selection of the Chiliades,
   or by some other hand, there are no direct means of ascertaining; nor
   except for purposes of curiosity is the question an important one. The
   version wholly lacks distinction. It is a work of adequate scholarship
   but of no independent literary merit. English prose was then hardly
   formed. The revival of letters had reached the country, but for
   political and social reasons which are readily to be found in any
   handbook of English history, it had found a soil, fertile indeed, but
   not yet broken up. Since Chaucer, English poetry had practically stood
   still, and except where poetry has cleared the way, prose does not in
   ordinary circumstances advance. A few adventurers in setting forth had
   appeared. More's Utopia, one of the earliest of English prose classics,
   is a classic in virtue of its style as well as of its matter. Berners's
   translation of Froissart, published in 1523, was the first and one of
   the finest of that magnificent series of translations which from this
   time onwards for about a century were produced in an almost continuous
   stream, and through which the secret of prose was slowly wrung from
   older and more accomplished languages. Latimer, about the same time,
   showed his countrymen how a vernacular prose, flexible, well knit, and
   nervous, might be written without its lines being traced on any ancient
   or foreign model. Coverdale, the greatest master of English prose whom
   the century produced, whose name has just missed the immortality that
   is secure for his work, must have substantially completed that
   magnificent version of the Bible which appeared in 1535, and to which
   the authorized version of the seventeenth century owes all that one
   work of genius can owe to another. It is not with these great men that
   the translator of this treatise can be compared. But he wrought, after
   his measure, on the same structure as they.

   It is then to the original Latin, not to this rude and stammering
   version, that scholars must turn now, as still more certainly they
   turned then, for the mind of Erasmus; for with him, even more eminently
   than with other authors, the style is the man, and his Latin is the
   substance, not merely the dress, of his thought. When he wrote it he
   was about forty-eight years of age. He was still in the fullness of his
   power. If he was often crippled by delicate health, that was no more
   than he had habitually been from boyhood. In this treatise we come very
   near the real man, with his strange mixture of liberalism and
   orthodoxy, of clear-sighted courage and a delicacy which nearly always
   might be mistaken for timidity.

   His text is that (in the translator's words) "nothing is either more
   wicked or more wretched, nothing doth worse become a man (I will not
   say a Christian man) than war." War was shocking to Erasmus alike on
   every side of his remarkably complex and sensitive nature. It was
   impious; it was inhuman; it was ugly; it was in every sense of the word
   barbarous, to one who before all things and in the full sense of the
   word was civilized and a lover of civilization. All these varied
   aspects of the case, seen by others singly and partially, were to him
   facets of one truth, rays of one light. His argument circles and
   flickers among them, hardly pausing to enforce one before passing
   insensibly to another. In the splendid vindication of the nature of man
   with which the treatise opens, the tone is rather that of Cicero than
   of the New Testament. The majesty of man resides above all in his
   capacity to "behold the very pure strength and nature of things;" in
   essence he is no fallen and corrupt creature, but a piece of
   workmanship such as Shakespeare describes him through the mouth of
   Hamlet. He was shaped to this heroic mould "by Nature, or rather god,"
   so the Tudor translation reads, and the use of capital letters, though
   only a freak of the printer, brings out with a singular suggestiveness
   the latent pantheism which underlies the thought of all the humanists.
   To this wonderful creature strife and warfare are naturally repugnant.
   Not only is his frame "weak and tender," but he is "born to love and
   amity." His chief end, the object to which all his highest and most
   distinctively human powers are directed, is coÃ¶perant labour in the
   pursuit of knowledge. War comes out of ignorance, and into ignorance it
   leads; of war comes contempt of virtue and of godly living. In the age
   of Machiavelli the word "virtue" had a double and sinister meaning; but
   here it is taken in its nobler sense. Yet, the argument continues, for
   "virtue," even in the Florentine statesman's sense, war gives but
   little room. It is waged mainly for "vain titles or childish wrath;" it
   does not foster, in those responsible for it, any one of the nobler
   excellences. The argument throughout this part of the treatise is, both
   in its substance and in its ornament, wholly apart from the dogmas of
   religion. The furies of war are described as rising out of a very pagan
   hell. The apostrophe of Nature to mankind immediately suggests the
   spirit as well as the language of Lucretius. Erasmus had clearly been
   reading the De Rerum Natura, and borrows some of his finest touches
   from that miraculous description of the growth of civilization in the
   fifth book, which is one of the noblest contributions of antiquity
   towards a real conception of the nature of the world and of man. The
   progressive degeneration of morality, because, as its scope becomes
   higher, practice falls further and further short of it, is insisted
   upon by both these great thinkers in much the same spirit and with much
   the same illustrations. The rise of empires, "of which there was never
   none yet in any nation, but it was gotten with the great shedding of
   man's blood," is seen by both in the same light. But Erasmus passes on
   to the more expressly religious aspect of the whole matter in the great
   double climax with which he crowns his argument, the wickedness of a
   Christian fighting against another man, the horror of a Christian
   fighting against another Christian. "Yea, and with a thing so
   devilish," he breaks out in a mingling of intense scorn and profound
   pity, "we mingle Christ."

   From this passionate appeal he passes to the praises of peace. Why
   should men add the horrors of war to all the other miseries and dangers
   of life? Why should one man's gain be sought only through another's
   loss? All victories in war are Cadmean; not only from their cost in
   blood and treasure, but because we are in very truth "the members of
   one body," "redeemed with Christ's blood." Such was the clear,
   unmistakable teaching of our Lord himself, such of his apostles. But
   the doctrine of Christ has been "plied to worldly opinion." Worldly
   men, philosophers following "the sophistries of Aristotle," worst of
   all, divines and theologians themselves, have corrupted the Gospel to
   the heathenish doctrine that "every man must first provide for
   himself." The very words of Scripture are wrested to this abuse.
   Self-defence is held to excuse any violence. "Peter fought," they say,
   "in the garden,"--yes, and that same night he denied his Master! "But
   punishment of wrong is a divine ordinance." In war the punishment falls
   on the innocent. "But the law of nature bids us repel violence by
   violence." What is the law of Christ? "But may not a prince go to war
   justly for his right?" Did any war ever lack a title? "But what of wars
   against the Turk?" Such wars are of Turk against Turk; let us overcome
   evil with good, let us spread the Gospel by doing what the Gospel
   commands: did Christ say, Hate them that hate you?

   Then, with the tact of an accomplished orator, he lets the tension
   relax, and drops to a lower tone. Even apart from all that has been
   urged, even if war were ever justifiable, think of the price that has
   to be paid for it. On this ground alone an unjust peace is far
   preferable to a just war. (These had been the very words of Colet to
   the king of England.) Men go to war under fine pretexts, but really to
   get riches, to satisfy hatred, or to win the poor glory of destroying.
   The hatred is but exasperated; the glory is won by and for the dregs of
   mankind; the riches are in the most prosperous event swallowed up ten
   times over. Yet if it be impossible but war should be, if there may be
   sometimes a "colour of equity" in it, and if the tyrant's plea,
   necessity, be ever well-founded, at least, so Erasmus ends, let it be
   conducted mercifully. Let us live in fervent desire of the peace that
   we may not fully attain. Let princes restrain their peoples; let
   churchmen above all be peacemakers. So the treatise passes to its
   conclusion with that eulogy of the Medicean pope already mentioned,
   which perhaps was not wholly undeserved. To the modern world the name
   of Leo X has come down marked with a note of censure or even of
   ignominy. It is fair to remember that it did not bear quite the same
   aspect to its contemporaries, nor to the ages which immediately
   followed. Under Rodrigo Borgia it might well seem to others than to the
   Florentine mystic that antichrist was enthroned, and Satan let loose
   upon earth. The eight years of Leo's pontificate (1513-21) were at
   least a period of outward splendour and of a refinement hitherto
   unknown. The corruption, half veiled by that refinement and splendour,
   was deep and mortal, but the collapse did not come till later. By
   comparison with the disastrous reign of Clement VII, his bastard
   cousin, that of Giovanni de' Medici seemed a last gleam of light before
   blackness descended on the world. Even the licence of a dissolute age
   was contrasted to its favour with the gloom, "tristitia," that settled
   down over Europe with the great Catholic reaction. The age of Leo X has
   descended to history as the age of Bembo, Sannazaro, Lascaris, of the
   Stanze of the Vatican, of Raphael's Sistine Madonna and Titian's
   Assumption; of the conquest of Mexico and the circumnavigation of
   Magellan; of Magdalen Tower and King's College Chapel. It was an
   interval of comparative peace before a long epoch of wars more cruel
   and more devastating than any within the memory of men. The general
   European conflagration did not break out until ten years after
   Erasmus's death; though it had then long been foreseen as inevitable.
   But he lived to see the conquest of Rhodes by Soliman, the sack of
   Rome, the breach between England and the papacy, the ill-omened
   marriage of Catherine de' Medici to the heir of the French throne.
   Humanism had done all that it could, and failed. In the sanguinary era
   of one hundred years between the outbreak of the civil war in the
   Empire and the Peace of Westphalia, the Renaissance followed the Middle
   Ages to the grave, and the modern world was born.

   The mere fact of this treatise having been translated into English and
   published by the king's printer shows, in an age when the literary
   product of England was as yet scanty, that it had some vogue and
   exercised some influence. But only a few copies of the work are known
   to exist; and it was never reprinted. It was not until nearly three
   centuries later, amid the throes of an European revolution equally
   vast, that the work was again presented in an English dress. Vicesimus
   Knox, a whig essayist, compiler, and publicist of some reputation at
   the time, was the author of a book which was published anonymously in
   1794 and found some readers in a year filled with great events in both
   the history and the literature of England. It was entitled
   "Anti-Polemus: or the Plea of Reason, Religion, and Humanity against
   War: a Fragment translated from Erasmus and addressed to Aggressors."
   That was the year when the final breach took place in the whig party,
   and when Pitt initiated his brief and ill-fated policy of conciliation
   in Ireland. It was also the year of two works of enormous influence
   over thought, Paley's Evidences and Paine's Age of Reason. Among these
   great movements Knox's work had but little chance of appealing to a
   wide audience. "Sed quid ad nos?" the bitter motto on the title-page,
   probably expressed the feelings with which it was generally regarded. A
   version of the treatise against war, made from the Latin text of the
   Adagia with some omissions, is the main substance of the volume; and
   Knox added a few extracts from other writings of Erasmus on the same
   subject. It does not appear to have been reprinted in England, except
   in a collected edition of Knox's works which may be found on the
   dustiest shelves of old-fashioned libraries, until, after the close of
   the Napoleonic wars, it was again published as a tract by the Society
   for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace. Some half dozen
   impressions of this tract appeared at intervals up to the middle of the
   century; its publication passed into the hands of the Society of
   Friends, and the last issue of which any record can be found was made
   just before the outbreak of the Crimean war. But in 1813 an abridged
   edition was printed at New York, and was one of the books which
   influenced the great movement towards humanity then stirring in the
   young Republic.

   At the present day, the reactionary wave which has overspread the world
   has led, both in England and America, to a new glorification of war.
   Peace is on the lips of governments and of individuals, but beneath the
   smooth surface the same passions, draped as they always have been under
   fine names, are a menace to progress and to the higher life of mankind.
   The increase of armaments, the glorification of the military life, the
   fanaticism which regards organized robbery and murder as a sacred
   imperial mission, are the fruits of a spirit which has fallen as far
   below the standard of humanism as it has left behind it the precepts of
   a still outwardly acknowledged religion. At such a time the noble
   pleading of Erasmus has more than a merely literary or antiquarian
   interest. For the appeal of humanism still is, as it was then, to the
   dignity of human nature itself.

   AGAINST WAR

DULCE BELLUM INEXPERTIS


   I t is both an elegant proverb, and among all others, by the writings
   of many excellent authors, full often and solemnly used, Dulce bellum
   inexpertis, that is to say, War is sweet to them that know it not.
   There be some things among mortal men's businesses, in the which how
   great danger and hurt there is, a man cannot perceive till he make a
   proof. The love and friendship of a great man is sweet to them that be
   not expert: he that hath had thereof experience, is afraid. It seemeth
   to be a gay and a glorious thing, to strut up and down among the nobles
   of the court, and to be occupied in the king's business; but old men,
   to whom that thing by long experience is well known, do gladly abstain
   themselves from such felicity. It seemeth a pleasant thing to be in
   love with a young damsel; but that is unto them that have not yet
   perceived how much grief and bitterness is in such love. So after this
   manner of fashion, this proverb may be applied to every business that
   is adjoined with great peril and with many evils: the which no man will
   take on hand, but he that is young and wanteth experience of things.

   Aristotle, in his book of Rhetoric, showeth the cause why youth is more
   bold, and contrariwise old age more fearful: for unto young men lack of
   experience is cause of great boldness, and to the other, experience of
   many griefs engendereth fear and doubting. Then if there be anything in
   the world that should be taken in hand with fear and doubting, yea,
   that ought by all manner of means to be fled, to be withstood with
   prayer, and to be clean avoided, verily it is war; than which nothing
   is either more wicked, or more wretched, or that more farther
   destroyeth, or that never hand cleaveth sorer to, or doth more hurt, or
   is more horrible, and briefly to speak, nothing doth worse become a man
   (I will not say a Christian man) than war. And yet it is a wonder to
   speak of, how nowadays in every place, how lightly, and how for every
   trifling matter, it is taken in hand, how outrageously and barbarously
   it is gested and done, not only of heathen people, but also of
   Christian men; not only of secular men, but also of priests and
   bishops; not only of young men and of them that have no experience, but
   also of old men and of those that so often have had experience; not
   only of the common and movable vulgar people, but most specially of the
   princes, whose duty had been, by wisdom and reason, to set in a good
   order and to pacify the light and hasty movings of the foolish
   multitude. Nor there lack neither lawyers, nor yet divines, the which
   are ready with their firebrands to kindle these things so abominable,
   and they encourage them that else were cold, and they privily provoke
   those to it that were weary thereof. And by these means it is come to
   that pass that war is a thing now so well accepted, that men wonder at
   him that is not pleased therewith. It is so much approved, that it is
   counted a wicked thing (and I had almost said heresy) to reprove this
   one thing, the which as it is above all other things most mischievous,
   so it is most wretched. But how more justly should this be wondered at,
   what evil spirit, what pestilence, what mischief, and what madness put
   first in man's mind a thing so beyond measure beastly, that this most
   pleasant and reasonable creature Man, the which Nature hath brought
   forth to peace and benevolence, which one alone she hath brought forth
   to the help and succour of all other, should with so wild wilfulness,
   with so mad rages, run headlong one to destroy another? At the which
   thing he shall also much more marvel, whosoever would withdraw his mind
   from the opinions of the common people, and will turn it to behold the
   very pure strength and nature of things; and will apart behold with
   philosophical eyes the image of man on the one side, and the picture of
   war on the other side.

   Then first of all if one would consider well but the behaviour and
   shape of man's body shall he not forthwith perceive that Nature, or
   rather God, hath shaped this creature, not to war, but to friendship,
   not to destruction, but to health, not to wrong, but to kindness and
   benevolence? For whereas Nature hath armed all other beasts with their
   own armour, as the violence of the bulls she hath armed with horns, the
   ramping lion with claws; to the boar she hath given the gnashing tusks;
   she hath armed the elephant with a long trump snout, besides his great
   huge body and hardness of the skin; she hath fenced the crocodile with
   a skin as hard as a plate; to the dolphin fish she hath given fins
   instead of a dart; the porcupine she defendeth with thorns; the ray and
   thornback with sharp prickles; to the cock she hath given strong spurs;
   some she fenceth with a shell, some with a hard hide, as it were thick
   leather, or bark of a tree; some she provideth to save by swiftness of
   flight, as doves; and to some she hath given venom instead of a weapon;
   to some she hath given a much horrible and ugly look, she hath given
   terrible eyes and grunting voice; and she hath also set among some of
   them continual dissension and debate--man alone she hath brought forth
   all naked, weak, tender, and without any armour, with most soft flesh
   and smooth skin. There is nothing at all in all his members that may
   seem to be ordained to war, or to any violence. I will not say at this
   time, that where all other beasts, anon as they are brought forth, they
   are able of themselves to get their food. Man alone cometh so forth,
   that a long season after he is born, he dependeth altogether on the
   help of others. He can neither speak nor go, nor yet take meat; he
   desireth help only by his infant crying: so that a man may, at the
   least way, by this conject, that this creature alone was born all to
   love and amity, which specially increaseth and is fast knit together by
   good turns done eftsoons of one to another. And for this cause Nature
   would, that a man should not so much thank her, for the gift of life,
   which she hath given unto him, as he should thank kindness and
   benevolence, whereby he might evidently understand himself, that he was
   altogether dedicate and bounden to the gods of graces, that is to say,
   to kindness, benevolence, and amity. And besides this Nature hath given
   unto man a countenance not terrible and loathly, as unto other brute
   beasts; but meek and demure, representing the very tokens of love and
   benevolence. She hath given him amiable eyes, and in them assured marks
   of the inward mind. She hath ordained him arms to clip and embrace. She
   hath given him the wit and understanding to kiss: whereby the very
   minds and hearts of men should be coupled together, even as though they
   touched each other. Unto man alone she hath given laughing, a token of
   good cheer and gladness. To man alone she hath given weeping tears, as
   it were a pledge or token of meekness and mercy. Yea, and she hath
   given him a voice not threatening and horrible, as unto other brute
   beasts, but amiable and pleasant. Nature not yet content with all this,
   she hath given unto man alone the commodity of speech and reasoning:
   the which things verily may specially both get and nourish benevolence,
   so that nothing at all should be done among men by violence.

   She hath endued man with hatred of solitariness, and with love of
   company. She hath utterly sown in man the very seeds of benevolence.
   She hath so done, that the selfsame thing, that is most wholesome,
   should be most sweet and delectable. For what is more delectable than a
   friend? And again, what thing is more necessary? Moreover, if a man
   might lead all his life most profitably without any meddling with other
   men, yet nothing would seem pleasant without a fellow: except a man
   would cast off all humanity, and forsaking his own kind would become a
   beast.

   Besides all this, Nature hath endued man with knowledge of liberal
   sciences and a fervent desire of knowledge: which thing as it doth most
   specially withdraw man's wit from all beastly wildness, so hath it a
   special grace to get and knit together love and friendship. For I dare
   boldly say, that neither affinity nor yet kindred doth bind the minds
   of men together with straiter and surer bands of amity, than doth the
   fellowship of them that be learned in good letters and honest studies.
   And above all this, Nature hath divided among men by a marvellous
   variety the gifts, as well of the soul as of the body, to the intent
   truly that every man might find in every singular person one thing or
   other, which they should either love or praise for the excellency
   thereof; or else greatly desire and make much of it, for the need and
   profit that cometh thereof. Finally she hath endowed man with a spark
   of a godly mind: so that though he see no reward, yet of his own
   courage he delighteth to do every man good: for unto God it is most
   proper and natural, by his benefit, to do everybody good. Else what
   meaneth it, that we rejoice and conceive in our minds no little
   pleasure when we perceive that any creature is by our means preserved.

   Moreover God hath ordained man in this world, as it were the very image
   of himself, to the intent, that he, as it were a god on earth, should
   provide for the wealth of all creatures. And this thing the very brute
   beasts do also perceive, for we may see, that not only the tame beasts,
   but also the leopards, lions, and other more fierce and wild, when they
   be in any great jeopardy, they flee to man for succour. So man is, when
   all things fail, the last refuge to all manner of creatures. He is unto
   them all the very assured altar and sanctuary.

   I have here painted out to you the image of man as well as I can. On
   the other side (if it like you) against the figure of Man, let us
   portray the fashion and shape of War.

   Now, then, imagine in thy mind, that thou dost behold two hosts of
   barbarous people, of whom the look is fierce and cruel, and the voice
   horrible; the terrible and fearful rustling and glistering of their
   harness and weapons; the unlovely murmur of so huge a multitude; the
   eyes sternly menacing; the bloody blasts and terrible sounds of
   trumpets and clarions; the thundering of the guns, no less fearful than
   thunder indeed, but much more hurtful; the frenzied cry and clamour,
   the furious and mad running together, the outrageous slaughter, the
   cruel chances of them that flee and of those that are stricken down and
   slain, the heaps of slaughters, the fields overflowed with blood, the
   rivers dyed red with man's blood. And it chanceth oftentimes, that the
   brother fighteth with the brother, one kinsman with another, friend
   against friend; and in that common furious desire ofttimes one
   thrusteth his weapon quite through the body of another that never gave
   him so much as a foul word. Verily, this tragedy containeth so many
   mischiefs, that it would abhor any man's heart to speak thereof. I will
   let pass to speak of the hurts which are in comparison of the other but
   light and common, as the treading down and destroying of the corn all
   about, the burning of towns, the villages fired, the driving away of
   cattle, the ravishing of maidens, the old men led forth in captivity,
   the robbing of churches, and all things confounded and full of thefts,
   pillages, and violence. Neither I will not speak now of those things
   which are wont to follow the most happy and most just war of all.

   The poor commons pillaged, the nobles overcharged; so many old men of
   their children bereaved, yea, and slain also in the slaughter of their
   children; so many old women destitute, whom sorrow more cruelly slayeth
   than the weapon itself; so many honest wives become widows, so many
   children fatherless, so many lamentable houses, so many rich men
   brought to extreme poverty. And what needeth it here to speak of the
   destruction of good manners, since there is no man but knoweth right
   well that the universal pestilence of all mischievous living proceedeth
   at once from war. Thereof cometh despising of virtue and godly living;
   thereof cometh, that the laws are neglected and not regarded; thereof
   cometh a prompt and a ready stomach, boldly to do every mischievous
   deed. Out of this fountain spring so huge great companies of thieves,
   robbers, sacrilegers, and murderers. And what is most grievous of all,
   this mischievous pestilence cannot keep herself within her bounds; but
   after it is begun in some one corner, it doth not only (as a contagious
   disease) spread abroad and infect the countries near adjoining to it,
   but also it draweth into that common tumult and troublous business the
   countries that be very far off, either for need, or by reason of
   affinity, or else by occasion of some league made. Yea and moreover,
   one war springeth of another: of a dissembled war there cometh war
   indeed, and of a very small, a right great war hath risen. Nor it
   chanceth oftentimes none otherwise in these things than it is feigned
   of the monster, which lay in the lake or pond called Lerna.

   For these causes, I trow, the old poets, the which most sagely
   perceived the power and nature of things, and with most meet feignings
   covertly shadowed the same, have left in writing, that war was sent out
   of hell: nor every one of the Furies was not meet and convenient to
   bring about this business, but the most pestilent and mischievous of
   them all was chosen out for the nonce, which hath a thousand names, and
   a thousand crafts to do hurt. She being armed with a thousand serpents,
   bloweth before her her fiendish trumpet. Pan with furious ruffling
   encumbereth every place. Bellona shaketh her furious flail. And then
   the wicked furiousness himself, when he hath undone all knots and
   broken all bonds, rusheth out with bloody mouth horrible to behold.

   The grammarians perceived right well these things, of the which some
   will, that war have his name by contrary meaning of the word Bellum,
   that is to say fair, because it hath nothing good nor fair. Nor bellum,
   that is for to say war, is none otherwise called Bellum, that is to say
   fair, than the furies are called Eumenides, that is to say meek,
   because they are wilful and contrary to all meekness. And some
   grammarians think rather, that bellum, war, should be derived out of
   this word Belva, that is for to say, a brute beast: forasmuch as it
   belongeth to brute beasts, and not unto men, to run together, each to
   destroy each other. But it seemeth to me far to pass all wild and all
   brute beastliness, to fight together with weapons.

   First, for there are many of the brute beasts, each in his kind, that
   agree and live in a gentle fashion together, and they go together in
   herds and flocks, and each helpeth to defend the other. Nor is it the
   nature of all wild beasts to fight, for some are harmless, as does and
   hares. But they that are the most fierce of all, as lions, wolves, and
   tigers, do not make war among themselves as we do. One dog eateth not
   another. The lions, though they be fierce and cruel, yet they fight not
   among themselves. One dragon is in peace with another. And there is
   agreement among poisonous serpents. But unto man there is no wild or
   cruel beast more hurtful than man.

   Again, when the brute beasts fight, they fight with their own natural
   armour: we men, above nature, to the destruction of men, arm ourselves
   with armour, invented by craft of the devil. Nor the wild beasts are
   not cruel for every cause; but either when hunger maketh them fierce,
   or else when they perceive themselves to be hunted and pursued to the
   death, or else when they fear lest their younglings should take any
   harm or be stolen from them. But (O good Lord) for what trifling causes
   what tragedies of war do we stir up? For most vain titles, for childish
   wrath, for a wench, yea, and for causes much more scornful than these,
   we be inflamed to fight.

   Moreover, when the brute beasts fight, then war is one for one, yea,
   and that is very short. And when the battle is sorest fought, yet is
   there not past one or two, that goeth away sore wounded. When was it
   ever heard that an hundred thousand brute beasts were slain at one time
   fighting and tearing one another: which thing men do full oft and in
   many places? And besides this, whereas some wild beasts have natural
   debate with some other that be of a contrary kind, so again there be
   some with which they lovingly agree in a sure amity. But man with man,
   and each with other, have among them continual war; nor is there league
   sure enough among any men. So that whatsoever it be, that hath gone out
   of kind, it hath gone out of kind into a worse fashion, than if Nature
   herself had engendered therein a malice at the beginning.

   Will ye see how beastly, how foul, and how unworthy a thing war is for
   man? Did ye never behold a lion let loose unto a bear? What gapings,
   what roarings, what grisly gnashing, what tearing of their flesh, is
   there? He trembleth that beholdeth them, yea, though he stand sure and
   safe enough from them. But how much more grisly a sight is it, how much
   more outrageous and cruel, to behold man to fight with man, arrayed
   with so much armour, and with so many weapons? I beseech you, who would
   believe that they were men, if it were not because war is a thing so
   much in custom that no man marvelleth at it? Their eyes glow like fire,
   their faces be pale, their marching forth is like men in a fury, their
   voice screeching and grunting, their cry and frenzied clamour; all is
   iron, their harness and weapons jingling and clattering, and the guns
   thundering. It might have been better suffered, if man, for lack of
   meat and drink, should have fought with man, to the intent he might
   devour his flesh and drink his blood: albeit, it is come also now to
   that pass, that some there be that do it more of hatred than either for
   hunger or for thirst. But now this same thing is done more cruelly,
   with weapons envenomed, and with devilish engines. So that nowhere may
   be perceived any token of man. Trow ye that Nature could here know it
   was the same thing, that she sometime had wrought with her own hands?
   And if any man would inform her, that it were man that she beheld in
   such array, might she not well, with great wondering, say these words?

   "What new manner of pageant is this that I behold? What devil of hell
   hath brought us forth this monster. There be some that call me a
   stepmother, because that among so great heaps of things of my making I
   have brought forth some venomous things (and yet have I ordained the
   selfsame venomous things for man's behoof); and because I have made
   some beasts very fierce and perilous: and yet is there no beast so wild
   nor so perilous, but that by craft and diligence he may be made tame
   and gentle. By man's diligent labour the lions have been made tame, the
   dragons meek, and the bears obedient. But what is this, that worse is
   than any stepmother, which hath brought us forth this new unreasonable
   brute beast, the pestilence and mischief of all this world? One beast
   alone I brought forth wholly dedicate to be benevolent, pleasant,
   friendly, and wholesome to all other. What hath chanced, that this
   creature is changed into such a brute beast? I perceive nothing of the
   creature man, which I myself made. What evil spirit hath thus defiled
   my work? What witch hath bewitched the mind of man, and transformed it
   into such brutishness? What sorceress hath thus turned him out of his
   kindly shape? I command and would that the wretched creature should
   behold himself in a glass. But, alas, what shall the eyes see, where
   the mind is away? Yet behold thyself (if thou canst), thou furious
   warrior, and see if thou mayst by any means recover thyself again. From
   whence hast thou that threatening crest upon thy head? From whence hast
   thou that shining helmet? From whence are those iron horns? Whence
   cometh it, that thine elbows are so sharp and piked? Where hadst thou
   those scales? Where hadst thou those brazen teeth? Of whence are those
   hard plates? Whence are those deadly weapons? From whence cometh to
   thee this voice more horrible than of a wild beast? What a look and
   countenance hast thou more terrible than of a brute beast? Where hast
   thou gotten this thunder and lightning, both more fearful and hurtful
   than is the very thunder and lightning itself? I formed thee a goodly
   creature; what came into thy mind, that thou wouldst thus transform
   thyself into so cruel and so beastly fashion, that there is no brute
   beast so unreasonable in comparison unto man?"

   These words, and many other such like, I suppose, the Dame Nature, the
   worker of all things, would say. Then since man is such as is showed
   before that he is, and that war is such a thing, like as too oft we
   have felt and known, it seemeth to me no small wonder, what ill spirit,
   what disease, or what mishap, first put into man's mind, that he would
   bathe his mortal weapon in the blood of man. It must needs be, that men
   mounted up to so great madness by divers degrees. For there was never
   man yet (as Juvenal saith) that was suddenly most graceless of all. And
   always things the worst have crept in among men's manners of living,
   under the shadow and shape of goodness. For some time those men that
   were in the beginning of the world led their lives in woods; they went
   naked, they had no walled towns, nor houses to put their heads in: it
   happened otherwhile that they were sore grieved and destroyed with wild
   beasts. Wherefore with them first of all, men made war, and he was
   esteemed a mighty strong man, and a captain, that could best defend
   mankind from the violence of wild beasts. Yea, and it seemed to them a
   thing most equable to strangle the stranglers, and to slay the slayers,
   namely, when the wild beast, not provoked by us for any hurt to them
   done, would wilfully set upon us. And so by reason that this was
   counted a thing most worthy of praise (for hereof it rose that Hercules
   was made a god), the lusty-stomached young men began all about to hunt
   and chase the wild beasts, and as a token of their valiant victory the
   skins of such beasts as they slew were set up in such places as the
   people might behold them. Besides this they were not contented to slay
   the wild beasts, but they used to wear their skins to keep them from
   the cold in winter. These were the first slaughters that men used:
   these were their spoils and robberies. After this, they went so
   farforth, that they were bold to do a thing which Pythagoras thought to
   be very wicked; and it might seem to us also a thing monstrous, if
   custom were not, which hath so great strength in every place: that by
   custom it was reputed in some countries a much charitable deed if a man
   would, when his father was very old, first sore beat him, and after
   thrust him headlong into a pit, and so bereave him of his life, by whom
   it chanced him to have the gift of life. It was counted a holy thing
   for a man to feed on the flesh of his own kinsmen and friends. They
   thought it a goodly thing, that a virgin should be made common to the
   people in the temple of Venus. And many other things, more abominable
   than these: of which if a man should now but only speak, every man
   would abhor to hear him. Surely there is nothing so ungracious, nor
   nothing so cruel, but men will hold therewith, if it be once approved
   by custom. Then will ye hear, what a deed they durst at the last do?
   They were not abashed to eat the carcases of the wild beasts that were
   slain, to tear the unsavoury flesh with their teeth, to drink the
   blood, to suck out the matter of them, and (as Ovid saith) to hide the
   beasts' bowels within their own. And although at that time it seemed to
   be an outrageous deed unto them that were of a more mild and gentle
   courage: yet was it generally allowed, and all by reason of custom and
   commodity. Yet were they not so content. For they went from the slaying
   of noisome wild beasts, to kill the harmless beasts, and such as did no
   hurt at all. They waxed cruel everywhere upon the poor sheep, a beast
   without fraud or guile. They slew the hare, for none other offence, but
   because he was a good fat dish of meat to feed upon. Nor they forbare
   not to kill the tame ox, which had a long season, with his sore labour,
   nourished the unkind household. They spared no kind of beasts, of
   fowls, nor of fishes. Yea, and the tyranny of gluttony went so farforth
   that there was no beast anywhere that could be sure from the cruelty of
   man. Yea, and custom persuaded this also, that it seemed no cruelty at
   all to slay any manner of beast, whatsoever it was, so they abstained
   from manslaughter. Now peradventure it lieth in our power to keep out
   vices, that they enter not upon the manners of men, in like manner as
   it lieth in our power to keep out the sea, that it break not in upon
   us; but when the sea is once broken in, it passeth our power to
   restrain it within any bounds. So either of them both once let in, they
   will not be ruled, as we would, but run forth headlong whithersoever
   their own rage carrieth them. And so after that men had been exercised
   with such beginnings to slaughter, wrath anon enticed man to set upon
   man, either with staff, or with stone, or else with his fist. For as
   yet, I think they used no other weapons. And now had they learned by
   the killing of beasts, that man also might soon and easily be slain
   with little labour. But this cruelty remained betwixt singular persons,
   so that yet there was no great number of men that fought together, but
   as it chanced one man against another. And besides this, there was no
   small colour of equity, if a man slew his enemy; yea, and shortly
   after, it was a great praise to a man to slay a violent and a
   mischievous man, and to rid him out of the world, such devilish and
   cruel caitiffs, as men say Cacus and Busiris were. For we see plainly,
   that for such causes, Hercules was greatly praised. And in process of
   time, many assembled to take part together, either as affinity, or as
   neighbourhood, or kindred bound them. And what is now robbery was then
   war. And they fought then with stones, or with stakes, a little burned
   at the ends. A little river, a rock, or such other like thing, chancing
   to be between them, made an end of their battle.

   In the mean season, while fierceness by use increaseth, while wrath is
   grown great, and ambition hot and vehement, by ingenious craft they arm
   their furious violence. They devise harness, such as it is, to fence
   them with. They invent weapons to destroy their enemies with. Thus now
   by few and few, now with greater company, and now armed they begin to
   fight. Nor to this manifest madness they forget not to give honour. For
   they call it Bellum, that is to say, a fair thing; yea, and they repute
   it a virtuous deed, if a man, with the jeopardy of his own life, manly
   resist and defend from the violence of his enemies, his wife, children,
   beasts, and household. And by little and little, malice grew so great,
   with the high esteeming of other things, that one city began to send
   defiance and make war to another, country against country, and realm
   against realm. And though the thing of itself was then most cruel, yet
   all this while there remained in them certain tokens, whereby they
   might be known for men: for such goods as by violence were taken away
   were asked and required again by an herald at arms; the gods were
   called to witness; yea, and when they were ranged in battle, they would
   reason the matter ere they fought. And in the battle they used but
   homely weapons, nor they used neither guile nor deceit, but only
   strength. It was not lawful for a man to strike his enemy till the sign
   of battle was given; nor was it not lawful to fight after the sounding
   of the retreat. And for conclusion, they fought more to show their
   manliness and for praise, than they coveted to slay. Nor all this while
   they armed them not, but against strangers, the which they called
   hostes, as they had been hospites, their guests. Of this rose empires,
   of the which there was never none yet in any nation, but it was gotten
   with the great shedding of man's blood. And since that time there hath
   followed continual course of war, while one eftsoons laboureth to put
   another out of his empire, and to set himself in. After all this, when
   the empires came once into their hands that were most ungracious of all
   other, they made war upon whosoever pleased them; nor were they not in
   greatest peril and danger of war that had most deserved to be punished,
   but they that by fortune had gotten great riches. And now they made not
   war to get praise and fame, but to get the vile muck of the world, or
   else some other thing far worse than that.

   I think not the contrary, but that the great, wise man Pythagoras meant
   these things when he by a proper device of philosophy frightened the
   unlearned multitude of people from the slaying of silly beasts. For he
   perceived, it should at length come to pass, that he which (by no
   injury provoked) was accustomed to spill the blood of a harmless beast,
   would in his anger, being provoked by injury, not fear to slay a man.

   War, what other thing else is it than a common manslaughter of many men
   together, and a robbery, the which, the farther it sprawleth abroad,
   the more mischievous it is? But many gross gentlemen nowadays laugh
   merrily at these things, as though they were the dreams and dotings of
   schoolmen, the which, saving the shape, have no point of manhood, yet
   seem they in their own conceit to be gods. And yet of those beginnings,
   we see we be run so far in madness, that we do naught else all our
   life-days. We war continually, city with city, prince with prince,
   people with people, yea, and (it that the heathen people confess to be
   a wicked thing) cousin with cousin, alliance with alliance, brother
   with brother, the son with the father, yea, and that I esteem more
   cruel than all these things, a Christian man against another man; and
   yet furthermore, I will say that I am very loath to do, which is a
   thing most cruel of all, one Christian man with another Christian man.
   Oh, blindness of man's mind! at those things no man marvelleth, no man
   abhorreth them. There be some that rejoice at them, and praise them
   above the moon: and the thing which is more than devilish, they call a
   holy thing. Old men, crooked for age, make war, priests make war, monks
   go forth to war; yea, and with a thing so devilish we mingle Christ.
   The battles ranged, they encounter the one the other, bearing before
   them the sign of the Cross, which thing alone might at the leastwise
   admonish us by what means it should become Christian men to overcome.

   But we run headlong each to destroy other, even from that heavenly
   sacrifice of the altar, whereby is represented that perfect and
   ineffable knitting together of all Christian men. And of so wicked a
   thing, we make Christ both author and witness. Where is the kingdom of
   the devil, if it be not in war? Why draw we Christ into war, with whom
   a brothel-house agreeth more than war? Saint Paul disdaineth, that
   there should be any so great discord among Christian men, that they
   should need any judge to discuss the matter between them. What if he
   should come and behold us now through all the world, warring for every
   light and trifling cause, striving more cruelly than ever did any
   heathen people, and more cruelly than any barbarous people? Yea, and ye
   shall see it done by the authority, exhortations, and furtherings of
   those that represent Christ, the prince of peace and very bishop that
   all things knitteth together by peace and of those that salute the
   people with good luck of peace. Nor is it not unknown to me what these
   unlearned people say (a good while since) against me in this matter,
   whose winnings arise of the common evils. They say thus: We make war
   against our wills: for we be constrained by the ungracious deeds of
   other. We make war but for our right. And if there come any hurt
   thereof, thank them that be causers of it. But let these men hold their
   tongues awhile, and I shall after, in place convenient, avoid all their
   cavillations, and pluck off that false visor wherewith we hide all our
   malice.

   But first as I have above compared man with war, that is to say, the
   creature most demure with a thing most outrageous, to the intent that
   cruelty might the better be perceived: so will I compare war and peace
   together, the thing most wretched, and most mischievous, with the best
   and most wealthy thing that is. And so at last shall appear, how great
   madness it is, with so great tumult, with so great labours, with such
   intolerable expenses, with so many calamities, affectionately to desire
   war: whereas agreement might be bought with a far less price.

   First of all, what in all this world is more sweet or better than amity
   or love? Truly nothing. And I pray you, what other thing is peace than
   amity and love among men, like as war on the other side is naught else
   but dissension and debate of many men together? And surely the property
   of good things is such, that the broader they be spread, the more
   profit and commodity cometh of them. Farther, if the love of one
   singular person with another be so sweet and delectable, how great
   should the felicity be if realm with realm, and nation with nation,
   were coupled together, with the band of amity and love? On the other
   side, the nature of evil things is such, that the farther they sprawl
   abroad, the more worthy they are to be called evil, as they be indeed.
   Then if it be a wretched thing, if it be an ungracious thing, that one
   man armed should fight with another, how much more miserable, how much
   more mischievous is it, that the selfsame thing should be done with so
   many thousands together? By love and peace the small things increase
   and wax great, by discord and debate the great things decay and come to
   naught. Peace is the mother and nurse of all good things. War suddenly
   and at once overthroweth, destroyeth, and utterly fordoeth everything
   that is pleasant and fair, and bringeth in among men a monster of all
   mischievous things.

   In the time of peace (none otherwise than as if the lusty springtime
   should show and shine in men's businesses) the fields are tilled, the
   gardens and orchards freshly flourish, the beasts pasture merrily; gay
   manours in the country are edified, the towns are builded, where as
   need is reparations are done, the buildings are heightened and
   augmented, riches increase, pleasures are nourished, the laws are
   executed, the common wealth flourisheth, religion is fervent, right
   reigneth, gentleness is used, craftsmen are busily exercised, the poor
   men's gain is more plentiful, the wealthiness of the rich men is more
   gay and goodly, the studies of most honest learnings flourish, youth is
   well taught, the aged folks have quiet and rest, maidens are luckily
   married, mothers are praised for bringing forth of children like to
   their progenitors, the good men prosper and do well, and the evil men
   do less offence.

   But as soon as the cruel tempest of war cometh on us, good Lord, how
   great a flood of mischiefs occupieth, overfloweth, and drowneth all
   together. The fair herds of beasts are driven away, the goodly corn is
   trodden down and destroyed, the good husbandmen are slain, the villages
   are burned up, the most wealthy cities, that have flourished so many
   winters, with that one storm are overthrown, destroyed, and brought to
   naught: so much readier and prompter men are to do hurt than good. The
   good citizens are robbed and spoiled of their goods by cursed thieves
   and murderers. Every place is full of fear, of wailing, complaining,
   and lamenting. The craftsmen stand idle; the poor men must either die
   for hunger, or fall to stealing. The rich men either stand and sorrow
   for their goods, that be plucked and snatched from them, or else they
   stand in great doubt to lose such goods as they have left them: so that
   they be on every side woebegone. The maidens, either they be not
   married at all, or else if they be married, their marriages are
   sorrowful and lamentable. Wives, being destitute of their husbands, lie
   at home without any fruit of children, the laws are laid aside,
   gentleness is laughed to scorn, right is clean exiled, religion is set
   at naught, hallowed and unhallowed things all are one, youth is
   corrupted with all manner of vices, the old folk wail and weep, and
   wish themselves out of the world, there is no honour given unto the
   study of good letters. Finally, there is no tongue can tell the harm
   and mischief that we feel in war.

   Perchance war might be the better suffered, if it made us but only
   wretched and needy; but it maketh us ungracious, and also full of
   unhappiness. And I think Peace likewise should be much made of, if it
   were but only because it maketh us more wealthy and better in our
   living. Alas, there be too many already, yea, and more than too many
   mischiefs and evils, with the which the wretched life of man (whether
   he will or no) is continually vexed, tormented, and utterly consumed.

   It is near hand two thousand years since the physicians had knowledge
   of three hundred divers notable sicknesses by name, besides other small
   sicknesses and new, as daily spring among us, and besides age also,
   which is of itself a sickness inevitable.

   We read that in one place whole cities have been destroyed with
   earthquakes. We read, also, that in another place there have been
   cities altogether burnt with lightning; how in another place whole
   regions have been swallowed up with opening of the earth, towns by
   undermining have fallen to the ground; so that I need not here to
   remember what a great multitude of men are daily destroyed by divers
   chances, which be not regarded because they happen so often: as sudden
   breaking out of the sea and of great floods, falling down of hills and
   houses, poison, wild beasts, meat, drink, and sleep. One hath been
   strangled with drinking of a hair in a draught of milk, another hath
   been choked with a little grapestone, another with a fishbone sticking
   in his throat. There hath been, that sudden joy hath killed out of
   hand: for it is less wonder of them that die for vehement sorrow.
   Besides all this, what mortal pestilence see we in every place. There
   is no part of the world, that is not subject to peril and danger of
   man's life, which life of itself also is most fugitive. So manifold
   mischances and evils assail man on every side that not without cause
   Homer did say: Man was the most wretched of all creatures living.

   But forasmuch these mischances cannot lightly be eschewed, nor they
   happen not through our fault, they make us but only wretched, and not
   ungracious withal. What pleasure is it then for them that be subject
   already to so many miserable chances, willingly to seek and procure
   themselves another mischief more than they had before, as though they
   yet wanted misery? Yea, they procure not a light evil, but such an evil
   that is worse than all the others, so mischievous, that it alone
   passeth all the others; so abundant, that in itself alone is
   comprehended all ungraciousness; so pestilent, that it maketh us all
   alike wicked as wretched, it maketh us full of all misery, and yet not
   worthy to be pitied.

   Now go farther, and with all these things consider, that the
   commodities of Peace spread themselves most far and wide, and pertain
   unto many men. In war if there happen anything luckily (but, O good
   Lord, what may we say happeneth well and luckily in war?), it
   pertaineth to very few, and to them that are unworthy to have it. The
   prosperity of one is the destruction of another. The enriching of one
   is the spoil and robbing of another. The triumph of one is the
   lamentable mourning of another, so that as the infelicity is bitter and
   sharp, the felicity is cruel and bloody. Howbeit otherwhile both
   parties wept according to the proverb, Victoria Cadmaea, Cadmus
   victorie, where both parties repented. And I wot not whether it came
   ever so happily to pass in war, that he that had victory did not repent
   him of his enterprise, if he were a good man.

   Then seeing Peace is the thing above all other most best and most
   pleasant, and, contrariwise, war the thing most ungracious and wretched
   of all other, shall we think those men to be in their right minds, the
   which when they may obtain Peace with little business and labour will
   rather procure war with so great labour and most difficulty?

   First of all consider, how loathly a thing the rumour of war is, when
   it is first spoken of. Then how envious a thing it is unto a prince,
   while with often tithes and taxes he pillageth his subjects. What a
   business hath he to make and entertain friends to help him? what a
   business to procure bands of strangers and to hire soldiers?

   What expenses and labours must he make in setting forth his navy of
   ships, in building and repairing of castles and fortresses, in
   preparing and apparelling of his tents and pavilions, in framing,
   making, and carrying of engines, guns, armour, weapons, baggage, carts,
   and victual? What great labour is spent in making of bulwarks, in
   casting of ditches, in digging of mines, in keeping of watches, in
   keeping of arrays, and in exercising of weapons? I pass over the fear
   they be in; I speak not of the imminent danger and peril that hangeth
   over their heads: for what thing in war is not to be feared? What is he
   that can reckon all the incommodious life that the most foolish
   soldiers suffer in the field? And for that worthy to endure worse, in
   that they will suffer it willingly. Their meat is so ill that an ox of
   Cyprus would be loath to eat it; they have but little sleep, nor yet
   that at their own pleasure. Their tents on every side are open on the
   wind. What, a tent? No, no; they must all the day long, be it hot or
   cold, wet or dry, stand in the open air, sleep on the bare ground,
   stand in their harness. They must suffer hunger, thirst, cold, heat,
   dust, showers; they must be obedient to their captains; sometimes they
   be clapped on the pate with a warder or a truncheon: so that there is
   no bondage so vile as the bondage of soldiers.

   Besides all this, at the sorrowful sign given to fight, they must run
   headlong to death: for either they must slay cruelly, or be slain
   wretchedly. So many sorrowful labours must they take in hand, that they
   may bring to pass that thing which is most wretched of all other. With
   so many great miseries we must first afflict and grieve our own self,
   that we may afflict and grieve other!

   Now if we would call this matter to account, and justly reckon how much
   war will cost, and how much peace, surely we shall find that peace may
   be got and obtained with the tenth part of the cares, labours, griefs,
   perils, expenses, and spilling of blood, with which the war is
   procured. So great a company of men, to their extreme perils, ye lead
   out of the realm to overthrow and destroy some one town: and with the
   labour of the selfsame men, and without any peril at all, another town,
   much more noble and goodly, might be new edified and builded. But you
   say, you will hurt and grieve your enemy: so even that doing is against
   humanity. Nevertheless, this I would ye should consider, that ye cannot
   hurt and grieve your enemies, but ye must first greatly hurt your own
   people. And it seemeth a point of a madman, to enterprise where he is
   sure and certain of so great hurt and damage, and is uncertain which
   way the chance of war will turn.

   But admit, that either foolishness, or wrath, or ambition, or
   covetousness, or outrageous cruelty, or else (which I think more like)
   the furies sent from hell, should ravish and draw the heathen people to
   this madness. Yet from whence cometh it into our minds, that one
   Christian man should draw his weapon to bathe it in another Christian
   man's blood? It is called parricide, if the one brother slay the other.
   And yet is a Christian man nearer joined to another than is one brother
   to another: except the bonds of nature be stronger than the bonds of
   Christ. What abominable thing, then, is it to see them almost
   continually fighting among themselves, the which are the inhabitants of
   one house the Church, which rejoice and say, that they all be the
   members of one body, and that have one head, which truly is Christ;
   they have all one Father in heaven; they are all taught and comforted
   by one Holy Spirit; they profess the religion of Christ all under one
   manner; they are all redeemed with Christ's blood; they are all newborn
   at the holy font; they use alike sacraments; they be all soldiers under
   one captain; they are all fed with one heavenly bread; they drink all
   of one spiritual cup; they have one common enemy the devil; finally,
   they be all called to one inheritance. Where be they so many sacraments
   of perfect concord? Where be the innumerable teachings of peace? There
   is one special precept, which Christ called his, that is, Charity. And
   what thing is so repugnant to charity as war? Christ saluted his
   disciples with the blessed luck of peace. Unto his disciples he gave
   nothing save peace, saving peace he left them nothing. In those holy
   prayers, he specially prayed the Father of heaven, that in like manner
   as he was one with the Father, so all his, that is to say, Christian
   men, should be one with him. Lo, here you may perceive a thing more
   than peace, more than amity, more than concord.

   Solomon bare the figure of Christ: for Solomon in the Hebrew tongue
   signifieth peaceable or peaceful. Him God would have to build his
   temple. At the birth of Christ the angels proclaimed neither war nor
   triumphs, but peace they sang. And before his birth the prophet David
   prophesied thus of him: Et factus est in pace locus ejus, that is to
   say, His dwelling place is made in peace. Search all the whole life of
   Christ, and ye shall never find thing that breathes not of peace, that
   signifieth not amity, that savoureth not of charity. And because he
   perceived peace could not well be kept, except men would utterly
   despise all those things for which the world so greedily fighteth, he
   commanded that we should of him learn to be meek. He calleth them
   blessed and happy that setteth naught by riches, for those he calleth
   poor in spirit. Blessed be they that despise the pleasures of this
   world, the which he calleth mourners. And them blessed he calleth that
   patiently suffer themselves, to be put out of their possessions,
   knowing that here in this world they are but as outlaws; and the very
   true country and possession of godly creatures is in heaven. He calleth
   them blessed which, deserving well of all men, are wrongfully blamed
   and ill afflicted. He forbade that any man should resist evil. Briefly,
   as all his doctrine commandeth sufferance and love, so all his life
   teacheth nothing else but meekness. So he reigned, so he warred, so he
   overcame, so he triumphed.

   Now the apostles, that had sucked into them the pure spirit of Christ,
   and were blessedly drunk with that new must of the Holy Ghost, preached
   nothing but meekness and peace. What do all the epistles of Paul sound
   in every place but peace, but long-suffering, but charity? What
   speaketh Saint John, what rehearseth he so oft, but love? What other
   thing did Peter? What other thing did all the true Christian writers?
   From whence then cometh all this tumult of wars amongst the children of
   peace? Think ye it a fable, that Christ calleth himself a vine tree,
   and his own the branches? Who did ever see one branch fight with
   another? Is it in vain that Paul so oft wrote, The Church to be none
   other thing, than one body compact together of divers members, cleaving
   to one head, Christ? Whoever saw the eye fight with the hand, or the
   belly with the foot? In this universal body, compact of all those
   unlike things, there is agreement. In the body of a beast, one member
   is in peace with another, and each member useth not the property
   thereto given for itself alone, but for the profit of all the other
   members. So that if there come any good to any one member alone, it
   helpeth all the whole body. And may the compaction or knitting of
   Nature do more in the body of a beast, that shortly must perish, than
   the coupling of the Holy Ghost in the mystical and immortal body of the
   Church? Do we to no purpose pray as taught by Christ: Good Lord, even
   as thy will is fulfilled in heaven, so let it be fulfilled in the
   earth? In that city of heaven is concord and peace most perfect. And
   Christ would have his Church to be none other than a heavenly people in
   earth, as near as might be after the manner of them that are in heaven,
   ever labouring and making haste to go thither, and always having their
   mind thereon.

   Now go to, let us imagine, that there should come some new guest out of
   the lunar cities, where Empedocles dwelleth, or else out of the
   innumerable worlds, that Democritus fabricated, into this world,
   desiring to know what the inhabitants do here. And when he was
   instructed of everything, it should at last be told him that, besides
   all other, there is one creature marvellously mingled, of body like to
   brute beasts and of soul like unto God. And it should also be told him,
   that this creature is so noble, that though he be here an outlaw out of
   his own country, yet are all other beasts at his commandment, the which
   creature through his heavenly beginning inclineth alway to things
   heavenly and immortal. And that God eternal loved this creature so
   well, that whereas he could neither by the gifts of nature, nor by the
   strong reasons of philosophy attain unto that which he so fervently
   desired, he sent hither his only begotten son, to the intent to teach
   this creature a new kind of learning. Then as soon as this new guest
   had perceived well the whole manner of Christ's life and precepts,
   would desire to stand in some high place, from whence he might behold
   that which he had heard. And when he should see all other creatures
   soberly live according to their kind, and, being led by the laws and
   course of nature, desire nothing but even as Nature would; and should
   see this one special creature man given riotously to tavern haunting,
   to vile lucre, to buying and selling, chopping and changing, to
   brawling and fighting one with another, trow ye that he would not think
   that any of the other creatures were man, of whom he heard so much of
   before, rather than he that is indeed man? Then if he that had
   instructed him afore would show him which creature is man, now would he
   look about to see if he could spy the Christian flock and company, the
   which, following the ordinance of that heavenly teacher Christ, should
   exhibit to him a figure or shape of the evangelical city. Think ye he
   would not rather judge Christians to dwell in any other place than in
   those countries, wherein we see so great superfluity, riot,
   voluptuousness, pride, tyranny, discord, brawlings, fightings, wars,
   tumults, yea, and briefly to speak, a greater puddle of all those
   things that Christ reproveth than among Turks or Saracens? From whence,
   then, creepeth this pestilence in among Christian people? Doubtless
   this mischief also is come in by little and little, like as many more
   other be, ere men be aware of them. For truly every mischief creepeth
   by little and little upon the good manners of men, or else under the
   colour of goodness it is suddenly received.

   So then first of all, learning and cunning crept in as a thing very
   meet to confound heretics, which defend their opinions with the
   doctrine of philosophers, poets, and orators. And surely at the
   beginning of our faith, Christian men did not learn those things; but
   such as peradventure had learned them, before they knew what Christ
   meant, they turned the thing that they had learned already, into good
   use.

   Eloquence of tongue was at the beginning dissembled more than despised,
   but at length it was openly approved. After that, under colour of
   confounding heretics, came in an ambitious pleasure of brawling
   disputations, which hath brought into the Church of Christ no small
   mischief. At length the matter went so farforth that Aristotle was
   altogether received into the middle of divinity, and so received, that
   his authority is almost reputed holier than the authority of Christ.
   For if Christ spake anything that did little agree with our life, by
   interpretation of Aristotle it was lawful to make it serve their
   purpose. But if any do never so little repugn against the high divinity
   of Aristotle, he is quickly with clapping of hands driven out of the
   place. For of him we have learned, that the felicity of man is
   imperfect, except he have both the good gifts of body and of fortune.
   Of him we have learned, that no commonweal may flourish, in which all
   things are common. And we endeavour ourselves to glue fast together the
   decrees of this man and the doctrine of Christ--which is as likely a
   thing as to mingle fire and water together. And a gobbet we have
   received of the civil laws, because of the equity that seemeth to be in
   them. And to the end they should the better serve our purpose, we have,
   as near as may be, writhed and plied the doctrine of the gospel to
   them. Now by the civil law it is lawful for a man to defend violence
   with violence, and each to pursue for his right. Those laws approve
   buying and selling; they allow usury, so it be measurable; they praise
   war as a noble thing, so, it be just. Finally all the doctrine of
   Christ is so defiled with the learning of logicians, sophisters,
   astronomers, orators, poets, philosophers, lawyers, and gentles, that a
   man shall spend the most part of his life, ere he may have any leisure
   to search holy scripture, to the which when a man at last cometh, he
   must come infected with so many worldly opinions, that either he must
   be offended with Christ's doctrines, or else he must apply them to the
   mind and of them that he hath learned before. And this thing is so much
   approved, that it is now a heinous deed, if a man presume to study holy
   scripture, which hath not buried himself up to the hard ears in those
   trifles, or rather sophistries of Aristotle. As though Christ's
   doctrine were such, that it were not lawful for all men to know it, or
   else that it could by any means agree with the wisdom of philosophers.
   Besides this we admitted at the beginning of our faith some honour,
   which afterward we claimed as of duty. Then we received riches, but
   that was to distribute to relieve poor men, which afterwards we turned
   to our own use. And why not, since we have learned by the law civil,
   that the very order of charity is, that every man must first provide
   for himself? Nor lack there colours to cloak this mischief: first it is
   a good deed to provide for our children, and it is right that we
   foresee how to live in age; finally, why should we, say they, give our
   goods away, if we come by them without fraud? By these degrees it is by
   little and little come to pass, that he is taken for the best man that
   hath most riches: nor never was there more honour given to riches among
   the heathen people, than is at this day among the Christian people. For
   what thing is there, either spiritual or temporal, that is not done
   with great show of riches? And it seemed a thing agreeable with those
   ornaments, if Christian men had some great jurisdiction under them. Nor
   there wanted not such as gladly submitted themselves. Albeit at the
   beginning it was against their wills, and scantly would they receive
   it. And yet with much work, they received it so, that they were content
   with the name and title only: the profit thereof they gladly gave unto
   other men. At the last, little by little it came to pass, that a bishop
   thought himself no bishop, except he had some temporal lordship withal;
   an abbot thought himself of small authority, if he had not wherewith to
   play the lordly sire. And in conclusion, we blushed never a deal at the
   matter, we wiped away all shamefastness, and shoved aside all the bars
   of comeliness. And whatever abuse was used among the heathen people,
   were it covetousness, ambition, riot, pomp, or pride, or tyranny, the
   same we follow, in the same we match them, yea, and far pass them. And
   to pass over the lighter things for the while, I pray you, was there
   ever war among the heathen people so long continually, or more cruelly,
   than among Christian people? What stormy rumblings, what violent brays
   of war, what tearing of leagues, and what piteous slaughters of men
   have we seen ourselves within these few years? What nation hath not
   fought and skirmished with another? And then we go and curse the Turk;
   and what can be a more pleasant sight to the Turks, than to behold us
   daily each slaying other?

   Xerxes doted, when he led out of his own country that huge multitude of
   people to make war upon the Greeks. Trow ye, was he not mad, when he
   wrote letters to the mountain called Athos, threatening that the hill
   should repent except it obeyed his lust? And the same Xerxes commanded
   also the sea to be beaten, because it was somewhat rough when he should
   have sailed over.

   Who will deny but Alexander the Great was mad also? He, the young god,
   wished that there were many worlds, the which he might conquer--so
   great a fever of vainglory had embraced his young lusty courage. And
   yet these same men, the which Seneca doubted not to call mad thieves,
   warred after a gentler fashion than we do; they were more faithful of
   their promise in war, nor they used not so mischievous engines in war,
   nor such crafts and subtleties, nor they warred not for so light causes
   as we Christian men do. They rejoiced to advance and enrich such
   provinces as they had conquered by war; and the rude people, that lived
   like wild beasts without laws, learning, or good manners, they taught
   them both civil conditions and crafts, whereby they might live like
   men. In countries that were not inhabited with people, they builded
   cities, and made them both fair and profitable. And the places that
   were not very sure, they fenced, for safeguard of the people, with
   bridges, banks, bulwarks; and with a thousand other such commodities
   they helped the life of man. So that then it was right expedient to be
   overcome. Yea, and how many things read we, that were either wisely
   done, or soberly spoken of them in the midst of their wars. As for
   those things that are done in Christian men's wars they are more filthy
   and cruel than is convenient here to rehearse. Moreover, look what was
   worst in the heathen peoples' wars, in that we follow them, yea, we
   pass them.

   But now it is worth while to hear, by what means we maintain this our
   so great madness. Thus they reason: If it had not been lawful by no
   means to make war, surely God would never have been the author to the
   Jews to make war against their enemies. Well said, but we must add
   hereunto, that the Jews never made war among themselves, but against
   strangers and wicked men. We, Christian men, fight with Christian men.
   Diversity of religion caused the Jews to fight against their enemies:
   for their enemies worshipped not God as they did. We make war
   oftentimes for a little childish anger, or for hunger of money, or for
   thirst of glory, or else for filthy meed. The Jews fought by the
   commandment of God; we make war to avenge the grief and displeasure of
   our mind. And nevertheless if men will so much lean to the example of
   the Jews, why do we not then in like manner use circumcision? Why do we
   not sacrifice with the blood of sheep and other beasts? Why do we not
   abstain from swine's flesh? Why doth not each of us wed many wives?
   Since we abhor those things, why doth the example of war please us so
   much? Why do we here follow the bare letter that killeth? It was
   permitted the Jews to make war, but so likewise as they were suffered
   to depart from their wives, doubtless because of their hard and froward
   manners. But after Christ commanded the sword to be put up, it is
   unlawful for Christian men to make any other war but that which is the
   fairest war of all, with the most eager and fierce enemies of the
   Church, with affection of money, with wrath, with ambition, with dread
   of death. These be our Philistines, these be our Nabuchodonosors, these
   be our Moabites and Ammonites, with the which it behooveth us to have
   no truce. With these we must continually fight, until (our enemies
   being utterly vanquished) we may be in quiet, for except we may
   overcome them, there is no man that may attain to any true peace,
   neither with himself, nor yet with no other. For this war alone is
   cause of true peace. He that overcometh in this battle, will make war
   with no man living. Nor I regard not the interpretation that some men
   make of the two swords, to signify either power spiritual or temporal.
   When Christ suffered Peter to err purposely, yea, after he was
   commanded to put up his sword, no man should doubt but that war was
   forbidden, which before seemed to be lawful. But Peter (say they)
   fought. True it is, Peter fought; he was yet but a Jew, and had not the
   spirit of a very Christian man. He fought not for his lands, or for any
   such titles of lands as we do, nor yet for his own life, but for his
   Master's life. And finally, he fought, the which within a while after
   forsook his Master. Now if men will needs follow the example of Peter
   that fought, why might they not as well follow the example of him
   forsaking his Master? And though Peter through simple affection erred,
   yet did his Master rebuke him. For else, if Christ did allow such
   manner of defence, as some most foolishly do interpret, why doth both
   all the life and doctrine of Christ preach no other thing but
   sufferance? Why sent he forth his disciples again tyrants, armed with
   nothing else but with a walking-staff and a scrip? If that sword, which
   Christ commanded his disciples to sell their coats to buy, be moderate
   defence against persecutors, like as some men do not only wickedly but
   also blindly interpret, why did the martyrs never use that defence? But
   (say they) the law of nature commandeth, it is approved by the laws,
   and allowed by custom, that we ought to put off from us violence by
   violence, and that each of us should defend his life, and eke his
   money, when the money (as Hesiod saith) is as lief as the life. All
   this I grant, but yet grace, the law of Christ, that is of more effect
   than all these things, commandeth us, that we should not speak ill to
   them that speak shrewdly to us; that we should do well to them that do
   ill to us, and to them that take away part of our possessions, we
   should give the whole; and that we should also pray for them that
   imagine our death. But these things (say they) appertain to the
   apostles; yea, they appertain to the universal people of Christ, and to
   the whole body of Christ's Church, that must needs be a whole and a
   perfect body, although in its gifts one member is more excellent than
   another. To them the doctrine of Christ appertaineth not, that hope not
   to have reward with Christ. Let them fight for money and for lordships,
   that laugh to scorn the saying of Christ: Blessed be the poor men in
   spirit; that is to say, be they poor or rich, blessed be they that
   covet no riches in this world. They that put all their felicity in
   these riches, they fight gladly to defend their life; but they be those
   that understand not this life to be rather a death, nor they perceive
   not that everlasting life is prepared for good men. Now they lay
   against us divers bishops of Rome, the which have been both authors and
   abettors of warring. True it is, some such there have been, but they
   were of late, and in such time as the doctrine of Christ waxed cold.
   Yea, and they be very few in comparison of the holy fathers that were
   before them, which with their writings persuade us to flee war. Why are
   these few examples most in mind? Why turn we our eyes from Christ to
   men? And why had we rather follow the uncertain examples, than the
   authority that is sure and certain? For doubtless the bishops of Rome
   were men. And it may be right well, that they were either fools or
   ungracious caitiffs. And yet we find not that any of them approved that
   we should still continually war after this fashion as we do, which
   thing I could with arguments prove, if I listed to digress and tarry
   thereupon.

   Saint Bernard praised warriors, but he so praised them, that he
   condemned all the manner of our warfare. And yet why should the saying
   of Saint Bernard, or the disputation of Thomas the Alquine, move me
   rather than the doctrine of Christ, which commandeth, that we should in
   no wise resist evil, specially under such manner as the common people
   do resist.

   But it is lawful (say they) that a transgressor be punished and put to
   death according to the laws: then is it not lawful for a whole country
   or city to be revenged by war? What may be answered in this place, is
   longer than is convenient to reply. But this much will I say, there is
   a great difference. For the evil-doer, found faulty and convicted, is
   by authority of the laws put to death. In war there is neither part
   without fault. Whereas one singular man doth offend, the punishment
   falleth only on himself; and the example of the punishment doth good
   unto all others. In war the most part of the punishment and harm falls
   upon them that least deserve to be punished; that is, upon husbandmen,
   old men, honest wives, young children, and virgins. But if there may
   any commodity at all be gathered of this most mischievous thing, that
   altogether goeth to the behoof of certain most vengeable thieves, hired
   soldiers, and strong robbers, and perhaps to a few captains, by whose
   craft war was raised for that intent, and with which the matter goeth
   never better than when the commonweal is in most high jeopardy and
   peril to be lost. Whereas one is for his offence grievously punished,
   it is the wealthy warning of all other: but in war to the end to
   revenge the quarrel of one, or else peradventure of a few, we cruelly
   afflict and grieve many thousands of them that nothing deserved. It
   were better to leave the offence of a few unpunished than while we seek
   occasion to punish one or two, to bring into assured peril and danger,
   both our neighbours and innocent enemies (we call them our enemies,
   though they never did us hurt); and yet are we uncertain, whether it
   shall fall on them or not, that we would have punished. It is better to
   let a wound alone, that cannot be cured without grievous hurt and
   danger of all the whole body, than go about to heal it.

   Now if any man will cry out and say: It were against all right, that he
   that offendeth should not be punished; hereunto I answer, that it is
   much more against all right and reason, that so many thousands of
   innocents should be brought into extreme calamity and mischief without
   deserving. Albeit nowadays we see, that almost all wars spring up I
   cannot tell of what titles, and of leagues between princes, that while
   they go about to subdue to their dominion some one town, they put in
   jeopardy all their whole empire. And yet within a while after, they
   sell or give away the same town again, that they got with shedding of
   so much blood.

   Peradventure some man will say: Wouldst not have princes fight for
   their right? I know right well, it is not meet for such a man as I am,
   to dispute overboldly of princes' matters, and though I might do it
   without any danger, yet is it longer than is convenient for this place.
   But this much will I say: If each whatsoever title be a cause
   convenient to go in hand with war, there is no man that in so great
   alterations of men's affairs, and in so great variety and changes, can
   want a title. What nation is there that hath not sometime been put out
   of their own country, and also have put other out? How oft have people
   gone from one country to another? How oft have whole empires been
   translated from one to another either by chance or by league. Let the
   citizens of Padua claim now again in God's name the country of Troy for
   theirs, because Antenor was sometime a Trojan. Let the Romans now
   hardily claim again Africa and Spain, because those provinces were
   sometime under the Romans. We call that a dominion, which is but an
   administration. The power and authority over men, which be free by
   Nature, and over brute beasts, is not all one. What power and
   sovereignty soever you have, you have it by the consent of the people.
   And if I be not deceived, he that hath authority to give, hath
   authority to take away again. Will ye see how small a matter it is that
   we make all this tumult for? The strife is not, whether this city or
   that should be obeisant to a good prince, and not in bondage of a
   tyrant; but whether Ferdinand or Sigismund hath the better title to it,
   whether that city ought to pay tribute to Philip or to King Louis. This
   is that noble right, for the which all the world is thus vexed and
   troubled with wars and manslaughter.

   Yet go to, suppose that this right or title be as strong and of as
   great authority as may be; suppose also there be no difference between
   a private field and a whole city; and admit there be no difference
   between the beasts that you have bought with your money and men, which
   be not only free, but also true Christians: yet is it a point for a
   wise man to cast in his mind, whether the thing that you will war for,
   be of so great value, that it will recompense the exceedingly great
   harms and loss of your own people. If ye cannot do in every point as
   becometh a prince, yet at the leastways do as the merchantman doeth: he
   setteth naught by that loss, which he well perceiveth cannot be avoided
   without a greater loss, and he reckoneth it a winning, that fortune
   hath been against him with his so little loss. Or else at the leastwise
   follow him, of whom there is a merry tale commonly told.

   There were two kinsmen at variance about dividing of certain goods, and
   when they could by no means agree, they must go to law together, that
   in conclusion the matter might be ended by sentence of the judges. They
   got them attorneys, the pleas were drawn, men of law had the matter in
   hand, they came before the judges, the complaint was entered, the cause
   was pleaded, and so was the war begun between them. Anon one of them
   remembering himself, called aside his adversary to him and said on this
   wise: "First it were a great shame, that a little money should dissever
   us twain, whom Nature hath knit so near together. Secondly, the end of
   our strife is uncertain, no less than of war. It is in our hands to
   begin when we will, but not to make an end. All our strife is but for
   an hundred crowns, and we shall spend the double thereof upon notaries,
   upon promoters, upon advocates, upon attorneys, upon judges, and upon
   judges' friends, if we try the law to the uttermost. We must wait upon
   these men, we must flatter and speak them fair, we must give them
   rewards. And yet I speak not of the care and thought, nor of the great
   labour and travail, that we must take to run about here and there to
   make friends; and which of us two that winneth the victory, shall be
   sure of more incommodity than profit. Wherefore if we be wise, let us
   rather see to our own profit, and the money that shall be evil bestowed
   upon these bribers, let us divide it between us twain. And forgive you
   the half of that ye think should be your due, and I will forgive as
   much of mine. And so shall we keep and preserve our friendship, which
   else is like to perish, and we shall also eschew this great business,
   cost, and charge. If you be not content to forgo anything of your part,
   I commit the whole matter into your own hands; do with it as you will.
   For I had liefer my friend had this money, than those insatiable
   thieves. Methinks I have gained enough, if I may save my good name,
   keep my friend, and avoid this unquiet and chargeable business." Thus
   partly the telling of the truth, and partly the merry conceit of his
   kinsman, moved the other man to agree. So they ended the matter between
   themselves, to the great displeasure of the judges and servants, for
   they, like a sort of gaping ravens, were deluded and put beside their
   prey.

   Let a prince therefore follow the wisdom of these two men, specially in
   a matter of much more danger. Nor let him not regard what thing it is
   that he would obtain, but what great loss of good things he shall have,
   in what great jeopardies he shall be, and what miseries he must endure,
   to come thereby. Now if a man will weigh, as it were in a pair of
   balances, the commodities of war on the one side and the incommodities
   on the other side, he shall find that unjust peace is far better than
   righteous war. Why had we rather have war than peace? Who but a madman
   will angle with a golden fish-hook? If ye see that the charges and
   expenses shall amount far above your gain, yea, though all things go
   according to your mind, is it not better that ye forgo part of your
   right than to buy so little commodity with so innumerable mischiefs? I
   had liefer that any other man had the title, than I should win it with
   so great effusion of Christian men's blood. He (whosoever he be) hath
   now been many years in possession; he is accustomed to rule, his
   subjects know him, he behaveth him like a prince; and one shall come
   forth, who, finding an old title in some histories or in some blind
   evidence, will turn clean upside down the quiet state and good order of
   that commonweal. What availeth it with so great troubling to change any
   title, which in short space by one chance or other must go to another
   man? Specially since we might see, that no things in this world
   continue still in one state, but at the scornful pleasure of fortune
   they roll to and fro, as the waves of the sea. Finally, if Christian
   men cannot despise and set at naught these so light things, yet whereto
   need they by and by to run to arms? Since there be so many bishops, men
   of great gravity and learning; since there be so many venerable abbots;
   since there be so many noble men of great age, whom long use and
   experience of things hath made right wise: why are not these trifling
   and childish quarrels of princes pacified and set in order by the
   wisdom and discretion of these men? But they seem to make a very honest
   reason of war, which pretend as they would defend the Church: as though
   the people were not the Church, or as though the Church of Christ was
   begun, augmented, and stablished with wars and slaughters, and not
   rather in spilling of the blood of martyrs, sufferance, and despising
   of this life, or as though the whole dignity of the Church rested in
   the riches of the priests. Nor to me truly it seemeth not so allowable,
   that we should so oft make war upon the Turks. Doubtless it were not
   well with the Christian religion, if the only safeguard thereof should
   depend on such succours. Nor it is not likely, that they should be good
   Christians, that by these means are brought thereto at the first. For
   that thing that is got by war, is again in another time lost by war.
   Will ye bring the Turks to the faith of Christ? Let us not make a show
   of our gay riches, nor of our great number of soldiers, nor of our
   great strength. Let them see in us none of these solemn titles, but the
   assured tokens of Christian men: a pure, innocent life; a fervent
   desire to do well, yea, to our very enemies; the despising of money,
   the neglecting of glory, a poor simple life. Let them hear the heavenly
   doctrine agreeable to such a manner of life. These are the best armours
   to subdue the Turks to Christ. Now oftentimes we, being ill, fight with
   the evil. Yea, and I shall say another thing (which I would to God were
   more boldly spoken than truly), if we set aside the title and sign of
   the Cross, we fight Turks against Turks. If our religion were first
   stablished by the might and strength of men of war, if it were
   confirmed by dint of sword, if it were augmented by war, then let us
   maintain it by the same means and ways. But if all things in our faith
   were brought to pass by other means, why do we, then (as we mistrusted
   the help of Christ), seek such succour as the heathen people use? But
   why should we not (say they) kill them that would kill us? So think
   they it a great dishonour, if other should be more mischievous than
   they. Why do ye not, then, rob those that have robbed you before? Why
   do ye not scold and chide at them that rail at you? Why do ye not hate
   them that hate you? Trow ye it is a good Christian man's deed to slay a
   Turk? For be the Turks never so wicked, yet they are men, for whose
   salvation Christ suffered death. And killing Turks we offer to the
   devil most pleasant sacrifice, and with that one deed we please our
   enemy, the devil, twice: first because a man is slain, and again,
   because a Christian man slew him. There be many, which desiring to seem
   good Christian men, study to hurt and grieve the Turks all that ever
   they may; and where they be not able to do anything, they curse and
   ban, and bid a mischief upon them. Now by the same one point a man may
   perceive, that they be far from good Christian men. Succour the Turks,
   and where they be wicked, make them good if ye can; if ye cannot, wish
   and desire of God they may have grace to turn to goodness. And he that
   thus doeth, I will say doeth like a Christian man. But of all these
   things I shall entreat more largely, when I set forth my book entitled
   Antipolemus, which whilom when I was at Rome I wrote to Julius, bishop
   of Rome, the second of that name, at the same time, when he was
   counselled to make war on the Venetians.

   But there is one thing which is more to be lamented then reasoned: That
   if a man would diligently discuss the matter, he shall find that all
   the wars among us Christian men do spring either of foolishness, or
   else of malice. Some young men without experience, inflamed with the
   evil examples of their forefathers, that they find by reading of
   histories, written of some foolish authors (and besides this being
   moved with the exhortations of flatterers, with the instigation of
   lawyers, and assenting thereto of the divines, the bishops winking
   thereat, or peradventure enticing thereunto), have rather of
   foolhardiness than of malice, gone in hand with war; and with the great
   hurt and damage of all this world they learn, that war is a thing that
   should be by all means and ways fled and eschewed. Some other are moved
   by privy hatred, ambition causeth some, and some are stirred by
   fierceness of mind to make war. For truly there is almost now no other
   thing in our cities and commonweals than is contained in Homer's work
   Iliad, The wrath of indiscreet princes and people.

   There be those who for no other cause stir up war but to the intent
   they may by that means the more easily exercise tyranny on their
   subjects. For in the time of peace, the authority of the council, the
   dignity of the rulers, the vigour and strength of the laws, do somewhat
   hinder, that a prince cannot do all that him listeth; but as soon as
   war is once begun, now all the handling of matters resteth in the
   pleasure of a few persons. They that the prince favoureth are lifted up
   aloft, and they that be in his displeasure, go down. They exact as much
   money as pleaseth them. What need many words? Then they think
   themselves, that they be the greatest princes of the world. In the
   meantime the captains sport and play together, till they have gnawed
   the poor people to the hard bones. And think ye that it will grieve
   them, that be of this mind, to enter lightly into war, when any cause
   is offered? Besides all this, it is worth while to see by what means we
   colour our fault. I pretend the defence of our religion, but my mind is
   to get the great riches that the Turk hath. Under colour to defend the
   Church's right, I purpose to revenge the hatred that I have in my
   stomach. I incline to ambition, I follow my wrath; my cruel, fierce and
   unbridled mind compelleth me; and yet will I find a cavillation and
   say, the league is not kept, or friendship is broken, or something (I
   wot not what myself) concerning the laws of matrimony is omitted. And
   it is a wonder to speak, how they never obtain the very thing that they
   so greatly desire. And while they foolishly labour to eschew this
   mischief or that, they fall into another much worse, or else deeper
   into the same. And surely if desire of glory causeth them thus to do,
   it is a thing much more magnificent and glorious to save than to
   destroy; much more gay and goodly to build a city than to overthrow and
   destroy a city.

   Furthermore admit that the victory in battle is got most prosperously,
   yet how small a portion of the glory shall go unto the prince: the
   commons will claim a great part of it, by the help of whose money the
   deed was done; foreign soldiers, that are hired for money, will
   challenge much more than the commons; the captains look to have very
   much of that glory; and fortune has the most of all, which striking a
   great stroke in every matter, in war may do most of all. If it come of
   a noble courage or stout stomach, that you be moved to make war: see, I
   pray you, how far wide ye be from your purpose. For while ye will not
   be seen to bow to one man, as to a prince your neighbour, peradventure
   of your alliance, who may by fortune have done you good: how much more
   abjectly must ye bow yourself, what time ye seek aid and help of
   barbarous people; yea, and, what is more unworthy, of such men as are
   defiled with all mischievous deeds, if we must needs call such kind of
   monsters men? Meanwhile ye go about to allure unto you with fair words
   and promises, ravishers of virgins and of religious women, men-killers,
   stout robbers and rovers (for these be thy special men of war). And
   while you labour to be somewhat cruel and superior over your equal, you
   are constrained to submit yourselves to the very dregs of all men
   living. And while ye go about to drive your neighbour out of his land,
   ye must needs first bring into your own land the most pestilent puddle
   of unthrifts that can be. You mistrust a prince of your own alliance,
   and will you commit yourself wholly to an armed multitude? How much
   surer were it to commit yourself to concord!

   If ye will make war because of lucre, take your counters and cast. And
   I will say, it is better to have war than peace, if ye find not, that
   not only less, but also uncertain winning is got with inestimable
   costs.

   Ye say ye make war for the safeguard of the commonweal, yea, but noway
   sooner nor more unthriftily may the commonweal perish than by war. For
   before ye enter into the field, ye have already hurt more your country
   than ye can do good getting the victory. Ye waste the citizens' goods,
   ye fill the houses with lamentation, ye fill all the country with
   thieves, robbers, and ravishers. For these are the relics of war. And
   whereas before ye might have enjoyed all France, ye shut yourselves
   from many regions thereof. If ye love your own subjects truly, why
   revolve you not in mind these words: Why shall I put so many, in their
   lusty, flourishing youth, in all mischiefs and perils? Why shall I
   depart so many honest wives and their husbands, and make so many
   fatherless children? Why shall I claim a title I know not, and a
   doubtful right, with spilling of my subjects' blood? We have seen in
   our time, that in war made under colour of defence of the Church, the
   priests have been so often pillaged with contributions, that no enemy
   might do more. So that while we go about foolishly to escape falling in
   the ditch, while we cannot suffer a light injury, we afflict ourselves
   with most grievous despites. While we be ashamed of gentleness to bow
   to a prince, we be fain to please people most base. While we
   indiscreetly covet liberty, we entangle ourselves in most grievous
   bondage. While we hunt after a little lucre, we grieve ourselves and
   ours with inestimable harness. It had been a point of a prudent
   Christian man (if he be a true Christian man) by all manner of means to
   have fled, to have shunned, and by prayer to have withstood so fiendish
   a thing, and so far both from the life and doctrine of Christ. But if
   it can by no means be eschewed, by reason of the ungraciousness of many
   men, when ye have essayed every way, and that ye have for peace sake
   left no stone unturned, then the next way is, that ye do your diligence
   that so ill a thing may be gested and done by them that be evil, and
   that it be achieved with as little effusion of man's blood as can be.

   Now if we endeavour to be the selfsame thing that we hear ourselves
   called,--that is, good Christian men,--we shall little esteem any
   worldly thing, nor yet ambitiously covet anything of this world. For if
   we set all our mind, that we may lightly and purely part hence; if we
   incline wholly to heavenly things; if we pitch all our felicity in
   Christ alone; if we believe all that is truly good, truly gay and
   glorious, truly joyful, to remain in Christ alone; if we thoroughly
   think that a godly man can of no man be hurt; if we ponder how vain and
   vanishing are the scornful things of this world; if we inwardly behold
   how hard a thing it is for a man to be in a manner transformed into a
   god, and so here, with continual and indefatigable meditation, to be
   purged from all infections of this world, that within a while the husk
   of this body being cast off, it may pass hence to the company of
   angels; finally, if we surely have these three things, without which
   none is worthy of the name of a Christian man,--Innocency, that we may
   be pure from all vices; Charity, that we may do good, as near as we
   can, to every man; Patience, that we may suffer them that do us ill,
   and, if we can, with good deeds overcome wrongs to us done: I pray you,
   what war can there be among us for trifles? If it be but a tale that is
   told of Christ, why do we not openly put him out of our company? Why
   should we glory in his title? But if he be, as he is in very deed, the
   true way, the very truth, and the very life, why doth all the manner of
   our living differ so far asunder from the true example of him? If we
   acknowledge and take Christ for our author, which is very Charity, and
   neither taught nor gave other thing but charity and peace, then go to,
   let us not in titles and signs, but in our deeds and living, plainly
   express him. Let us have in our hearts a fervent desire of peace, that
   Christ may again know us for his. To this intent the princes, the
   prelates, and the cities and commonalties should apply their counsels.
   There hath been hitherto enough spilt of Christian man's blood. We have
   showed pleasure enough to the enemies of the Christian religion. And if
   the common people, as they are wont, make any disturbance, let the
   princes bridle and quail them, which princes ought to be the selfsame
   thing in the commonweal that the eye is in the body, and the reason in
   the soul. Again, if the princes make any trouble, it is the part of
   good prelates by their wisdom and gravity to pacify and assuage such
   commotion. Or else, at the least, we being satiate with continual wars,
   let the desire of peace a little move us. The bishop exhorteth us (if
   ever any bishop did Leo the Tenth doth, which occupieth the room of our
   peaceable Solomon, for all his desire, all his intent and labour, is
   for this intent) that they whom one common faith hath coupled together,
   should be joined in one common concord. He laboureth that the Church of
   Christ should flourish, not in riches or lordships, but in her own
   proper virtues. Surely this is a right goodly act, and well beseeming a
   man descended of such a noble lineage as the Medici: by whose civil
   prudence the noble city of Florence most freshly flourished in
   long-continued peace; whose house of Medici hath been a help unto all
   good letters. Leo himself, having alway a sober and a gentle wit,
   giving himself from his tender youth to good letters of humanity, was
   ever brought up, as it were, in the lap of the Muses, among men most
   highly learned. He so faultless led his life, that even in the city of
   Rome, where is most liberty of vice, was of him no evil rumour, and so
   governing himself came to the dignity to be bishop there, which dignity
   he never coveted, but was chosen thereto when he least thought thereon,
   by the provision of God to help to redress things in great decay by
   long wars. Let Julius the bishop have his glory of war, victories, and
   of his great triumphs, the which how evil they beseem a Christian
   bishop, it is not for such a one as I am to declare. I will this say,
   his glory, whatsoever it be, was mixed with the great destruction and
   grievous sorrow of many a creature. But by peace restored now to the
   world, Leo shall get more true glory than Julius won by so many wars
   that he either boldly begun, or prosperously fought and achieved.

   But they that had liefer hear of proverbs, than either of peace or of
   war, will think that I have tarried longer about this digression than
   is meet for the declaration of a proverb.
