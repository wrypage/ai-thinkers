  On the Christian Life

   This book treats of the Life of the Christian. Its five chapters are
   arranged as to admit of being classed under two principal heads.

   First, it must be held to be an universally acknowledged point, that no
   man is a Christian who does not feel some special love for
   righteousness, chap. i. Second, in regard to the standard by which
   every man ought to regulate his life, although it seems to be
   considered in chap. ii. only, yet the three following chapters also
   refer to it. For it shows that the Christian has two duties to perform.
   First, the observance being so arduous, he needs the greatest patience.
   Hence chap. iii. treats professedly of the utility of the cross, and
   chap. iv. invites to meditation on the future life. Lastly, chap. v.
   clearly shows, as in no small degree conducive to this end, how we are
   to use this life and its comforts without abusing them.

CHAPTER I.

    THE LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN MAN. SCRIPTURAL ARGUMENTS EXHORTING TO IT.

    1. Connection between this chapter and the doctrine of Regeneration.
       Necessity of the doctrine concerning the Christian Life. The
       brevity of this treatise. The method of it. Plainness and unadorned
       simplicity of the Scripture system of morals.
    2. Two divisions. First, Personal holiness. 1. Because God is holy. 2.
       Because of our communion with his saints.
    3. Second division, relating to our Redemption. Admirable moral system
       of Scripture. Five special inducements or exhortations to a
       Christian Life.
    4. False Christians who are opposed to this life censured 1. They have
       not truly learned Christ. 2. The Gospel not the guide of their
       words or actions. 3. They do not imitate Christ the Master. 4. They
       would separate the Spirit from his word.
    5. Christians ought not to despond: Provided 1. They take the word of
       God for their guide. 2. Sincerely cultivate righteousness. 3. Walk,
       according to their capacity, in the ways of the Lord. 4. Make some
       progress. 5. Persevere.

CHAPTER II.

    II. A SUMMARY OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. OF SELF-DENIAL.

    1. Consideration of the second general division in regard to the
       Christian life. Its beginning and sum. A twofold respect. 1. We are
       not our own. Respect to both the fruit and the use. Unknown to
       philosophers, who have placed reason on the throne of the Holy
       Spirit.
    2. Since we are not our own, we must seek the glory of God, and obey
       his will. Self-denial recommended to the disciples of Christ. He
       who neglects it, deceived either by pride or hypocrisy, rushes on
       destruction.
    3. Three things to be followed, and two to be shunned in life. Impiety
       and worldly lusts to be shunned. Sobriety, justice, and piety, to
       be followed. An inducement to right conduct.
    4. Self-denial the sum of Paul's doctrine. Its difficulty. Qualities
       in us which make it difficult. Cures for these qualities. 1.
       Ambition to be suppressed. 2. Humility to be embraced. 3. Candour
       to be esteemed. 4. Mutual charity to be preserved. 5. Modesty to be
       sincerely cultivated.
    5. The advantage of our neighbour to be promoted. Here self-denial
       most necessary, and yet most difficult. Here a double remedy. 1.
       The benefits bestowed upon us are for the common benefit of the
       Church. 2. We ought to do all we can for our neighbour. This
       illustrated by analogy from the members of the human body. This
       duty of charity founded on the divine command.
    6. Charity ought to have for its attendants patience and kindness. We
       should consider the image of God in our neighbours, and especially
       in those who are of the household of faith. Hence a fourfold
       consideration which refutes all objections. A common objection
       refuted.
    7. Christian life cannot exist without charity. Remedies for the vices
       opposed to charity. 1. Mercy. 2. Humility. 3. Modesty. 4.
       Diligence. 5. Perseverance.
    8. Self-denial, in respect of God, should lead to equanimity and
       tolerance. 1. We are always subject to God. 2. We should shun
       avarice and ambition. 3. We should expect all prosperity from the
       blessing of God, and entirely depend on him.
    9. We ought not to desire wealth or honours without the divine
       blessing, nor follow the arts of the wicked. We ought to cast all
       our care upon God, and never envy the prosperity of others.
   10. We ought to commit ourselves entirely to God. The necessity of this
       doctrine. Various uses of affliction. Heathen abuse and corruption.

CHAPTER III.

    OF BEARING THE CROSS--ONE BRANCH OF SELF-DENIAL.

    1. What the cross is. By whom, and on whom, and for what cause
       imposed. Its necessity and dignity.
    2. The cross necessary. 1. To humble our pride. 2. To make us apply to
       God for aid. Example of David. 3. To give us experience of God's
       presence.
    3. Manifold uses of the cross. 1. Produces patience, hope, and firm
       confidence in God, gives us victory and perseverance. Faith
       invincible.
    4. 2. Frames us to obedience. Example of Abraham. This training how
       useful.
    5. The cross necessary to subdue the wantonness of the flesh. This
       portrayed by an apposite simile. Various forms of the cross.
    6. 3. God permits our infirmities, and corrects past faults, that he
       may keep us in obedience. This confirmed by a passage from Solomon
       and an Apostle.
    7. Singular consolation under the cross, when we suffer persecution
       for righteousness. Some parts of this consolation.
    8. This form of the cross most appropriate to believers, and should be
       borne willingly and cheerfully. This cheerfulness is not unfeeling
       hilarity, but, while groaning under the burden, waits patiently for
       the Lord.
    9. A description of this conflict. Opposed to the vanity of the
       Stoics. Illustrated by the authority and example of Christ.
   10. Proved by the testimony and uniform experience of the elect. Also
       by the special example of the Apostle Peter. The nature of the
       patience required of us.
   11. Distinction between the patience of Christians and philosophers.
       The latter pretend a necessity which cannot be resisted. The former
       hold forth the justice of God and his care of our safety. A full
       exposition of this difference.

CHAPTER IV.

    OF MEDITATING ON THE FUTURE LIFE.

    1. The design of God in afflicting his people. 1. To accustom us to
       despise the present life. Our infatuated love of it. Afflictions
       employed as the cure. 2. To lead us to aspire to heaven.
    2. Excessive love of the present life prevents us from duly aspiring
       to the other. Hence the disadvantages of prosperity. Blindness of
       the human judgment. Our philosophizing on the vanity of life only
       of momentary influence. The necessity of the cross.
    3. The present life an evidence of the divine favour to his people;
       and therefore, not to be detested. On the contrary, should call
       forth thanksgiving. The crown of victory in heaven after the
       contest on earth.
    4. Weariness of the present life how to be tempered. The believer's
       estimate of life. Comparison of the present and the future life.
       How far the present life should be hated.
    5. Christians should not tremble at the fear of death. Two reasons.
       Objection. Answer. Other reasons.
    6. Reasons continued. Conclusion.

CHAPTER V.

    HOW TO USE THE PRESENT LIFE, AND THE COMFORTS OF IT.

    1. Necessity of this doctrine. Use of the goods of the present life.
       Extremes to be avoided. 1. Excessive austerity. 2. Carnal
       intemperance and lasciviousness.
    2. God, by creating so many mercies, consulted not only for our
       necessities, but also for our comfort and delight. Confirmation
       from a passage in the Psalms, and from experience.
    3. Excessive austerity, therefore, to be avoided. So also must the
       wantonness of the flesh. 1. The creatures invite us to know, love,
       and honour the Creator. 2. This not done by the wicked, who only
       abuse these temporal mercies.
    4. All earthly blessings to be despised in comparison of the heavenly
       life. Aspiration after this life destroyed by an excessive love of
       created objects. First, Intemperance.
    5. Second, Impatience and immoderate desire. Remedy of these evils.
       The creatures assigned to our use. Man still accountable for the
       use he makes of them.
    6. God requires us in all our actions to look to his calling. Use of
       this doctrine. It is full of comfort.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                   CHAPTER I.

    LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN MAN. SCRIPTURAL ARGUMENTS EXHORTING TO IT.

   This first chapter consists of two parts,--I. Connection between this
   treatise on the Christian Life and the doctrine of Regeneration and
   Repentance. Arrangement of the treatise, sec. 1-3. II. Extremes to be
   avoided; 1. False Christians denying Christ by their works condemned,
   sec. 4. 2. Christians should not despair, though they have not attained
   perfection, provided they make daily progress in piety and
   righteousness.

   1. WE have said that the object of regeneration is to bring the life of
   believers into concord and harmony with the righteousness of God, and
   so confirm the adoption by which they have been received as sons. But
   although the law comprehends within it that new life by which the image
   of God is restored in us, yet, as our sluggishness stands greatly in
   need both of helps and incentives it will be useful to collect out of
   Scripture a true account of this reformations lest any who have a
   heartfelt desire of repentance should in their zeal go astray.
   Moreover, I am not unaware that, in undertaking to describe the life of
   the Christian, I am entering on a large and extensive subject, one
   which, when fully considered in all its parts, is sufficient to fill a
   large volume. We see the length to which the Fathers in treating of
   individual virtues extend their exhortations. This they do, not from
   mere loquaciousness; for whatever be the virtue which you undertake to
   recommend, your pen is spontaneously led by the copiousness of the
   matter so to amplify, that you seem not to have discussed it properly
   if you have not done it at length. My intention, however, in the plan
   of life which I now propose to give, is not to extend it so far as to
   treat of each virtue specially, and expatiate in exhortation. This must
   be sought in the writings of others, and particularly in the Homilies
   of the Fathers. [1] For me it will be sufficient to point out the
   method by which a pious man may be taught how to frame his life aright,
   and briefly lay down some universal rule by which he may not improperly
   regulate his conduct. I shall one day possibly find time for more ample
   discourse, [or leave others to perform an office for which I am not so
   fit. I have a natural love of brevity, and, perhaps, any attempt of
   mine at copiousness would not succeed. Even if I could gain the highest
   applause by being more prolix, I would scarcely be disposed to attempt
   it, [2] ] while the nature of my present work requires me to glance at
   simple doctrine with as much brevity as possible. As philosophers have
   certain definitions of rectitude and honesty, from which they derive
   particular duties and the whole train of virtues; so in this respect
   Scripture is not without order, but presents a most beautiful
   arrangement, one too which is every way much more certain than that of
   philosophers. The only difference is, that they, under the influence of
   ambition, constantly affect an exquisite perspicuity of arrangement,
   which may serve to display their genius, whereas the Spirit of God,
   teaching without affectation, is not so perpetually observant of exact
   method, and yet by observing it at times sufficiently intimates that it
   is not to be neglected.

   2. The Scripture system of which we speak aims chiefly at two objects.
   The former is, that the love of righteousness, to which we are by no
   means naturally inclined, may be instilled and implanted into our
   minds. The latter is, (see chap. ii.,) to prescribe a rule which will
   prevent us while in the pursuit of righteousness from going astray. It
   has numerous admirable methods of recommending righteousness. [3] Many
   have been already pointed out in different parts of this work; but we
   shall here also briefly advert to some of them. With what better
   foundation can it begin than by reminding us that we must be holy,
   because "God is holy?" (Lev. xix. 1; 1 Pet. i. 16.) For when we were
   scattered abroad like lost sheep, wandering through the labyrinth of
   this world, he brought us back again to his own fold. When mention is
   made of our union with God, let us remember that holiness must be the
   bond; not that by the merit of holiness we come into communion with
   him, (we ought rather first to cleave to him, in order that, pervaded
   with his holiness, we may follow whither he calls,) but because it
   greatly concerns his glory not to have any fellowship with wickedness
   and impurity. Wherefore he tells us that this is the end of our
   calling, the end to which we ought ever to have respect, if we would
   answer the call of God. For to what end were we rescued from the
   iniquity and pollution of the world into which we were plunged, if we
   allow ourselves, during our whole lives, to wallow in them? Besides, we
   are at the same time admonished, that if we would be regarded as the
   Lord's people, we must inhabit the holy city Jerusalem, (Isaiah rev. 8,
   et alibi;) which, as he hath consecrated it to himself, it were impious
   for its inhabitants to profane by impurity. Hence the expressions, "Who
   shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He
   that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness," (Ps. xv. 1, 2;
   xxiv. 3, 4) for the sanctuary in which he dwells certainly ought not to
   be like an unclean stall.

   3. The better to arouse us, it exhibits God the Father, who, as he hath
   reconciled us to himself in his Anointed, has impressed his image upon
   us, to which he would have us to be conformed, (Rom. v. 4.) Come, then,
   and let them show me a more excellent system among philosophers, who
   think that they only have a moral philosophy duly and orderly arranged.
   They, when they would give excellent exhortations to virtue, can only
   tell us to live agreeably to nature. Scripture derives its exhortations
   from the true source, [4] when it not only enjoins us to regulate our
   lives with a view to God its author to whom it belongs; but after
   showing us that we have degenerated from our true origin, viz., the law
   of our Creator, adds, that Christ, through whom we have returned to
   favour with God, is set before us as a model, the image of which our
   lives should express. What do you require more effectual than this?
   Nay, what do you require beyond this? If the Lord adopts us for his
   sons on the condition that our life be a representation of Christ, the
   bond of our adoption,--then, unless we dedicate and devote ourselves to
   righteousness, we not only, with the utmost perfidy, revolt from our
   Creator, but also abjure the Saviour himself. Then, from an enumeration
   of all the blessings of God, and each part of our salvation, it finds
   materials for exhortation. Ever since God exhibited himself to us as a
   Father, we must be convicted of extreme ingratitude if we do not in
   turn exhibit ourselves as his sons. Ever since Christ purified us by
   the laver of his blood, and communicated this purification by baptism,
   it would ill become us to be defiled with new pollution. Ever since he
   ingrafted us into his body, we, who are his members, should anxiously
   beware of contracting any stain or taint. Ever since he who is our head
   ascended to heaven, it is befitting in us to withdraw our affections
   from the earth, and with our whole soul aspire to heaven. Ever since
   the Holy Spirit dedicated us as temples to the Lord, we should make it
   our endeavour to show forth the glory of God, and guard against being
   profaned by the defilement of sin. Ever since our soul and body were
   destined to heavenly incorruptibility and an unfading crown, we should
   earnestly strive to keep them pure and uncorrupted against the day of
   the Lord. These, I say, are the surest foundations of a well-regulated
   life, and you will search in vain for any thing resembling them among
   philosophers, who, in their commendation of virtue, never rise higher
   than the natural dignity of man.

   4. This is the place to address those who, having nothing of Christ but
   the name and sign, would yet be called Christians. How dare they boast
   of this sacred name? None have intercourse with Christ but those who
   have acquired the true knowledge of him from the Gospel. The Apostle
   denies that any man truly has learned Christ who has not learned to put
   off "the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,
   and put on Christ," (Eph. iv. 22.) They are convicted, therefore, of
   falsely and unjustly pretending a knowledge of Christ, whatever be the
   volubility and eloquence with which they can talk of the Gospel.
   Doctrine is not an affair of the tongue, but of the life; is not
   apprehended by the intellect and memory merely, like other branches of
   learning; but is received only when it possesses the whole soul, and
   finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart. Let
   them, therefore, either cease to insult God, by boasting that they are
   what they are not, or let them show themselves not unworthy disciples
   of their divine Master. To doctrine in which our religion is contained
   we have given the first place, since by it our salvation commences; but
   it must be transfused into the breast, and pass into the conduct, and
   so transform us into itself, as not to prove unfruitful. If
   philosophers are justly offended, and banish from their company with
   disgrace those who, while professing an art which ought to be the
   mistress of their conduct, convert it into mere loquacious sophistry,
   with how much better reason shall we detest those flimsy sophists who
   are contented to let the Gospel play upon their lips, when, from its
   efficacy, it ought to penetrate the inmost affections of the heart, fix
   its seat in the soul, and pervade the whole man a hundred times more
   than the frigid discourses of philosophers?

   5. I insist not that the life of the Christian shall breathe nothing
   but the perfect Gospel, though this is to be desired, and ought to be
   attempted. I insist not so strictly on evangelical perfection, as to
   refuse to acknowledge as a Christian any man who has not attained it.
   In this way all would be excluded from the Church, since there is no
   man who is not far removed from this perfection, while many, who have
   made but little progress, would be undeservedly rejected. What then?
   Let us set this before our eye as the end at which we ought constantly
   to aim. Let it be regarded as the goal towards which we are to run. For
   you cannot divide the matter with God, undertaking part of what his
   word enjoins, and omitting part at pleasure. For, in the first place,
   God uniformly recommends integrity as the principal part of his
   worship, meaning by integrity real singleness of mind, devoid of gloss
   and fiction, and to this is opposed a double mind; as if it had been
   said, that the spiritual commencement of a good life is when the
   internal affections are sincerely devoted to God, in the cultivation of
   holiness and justice. But seeing that, in this earthly prison of the
   body, no man is supplied with strength sufficient to hasten in his
   course with due alacrity, while the greater number are so oppressed
   with weakness, that hesitating, and halting, and even crawling on the
   ground, they make little progress, let every one of us go as far as his
   humble ability enables him, and prosecute the journey once begun. No
   one will travel so badly as not daily to make some degree of progress.
   This, therefore, let us never cease to do, that we may daily advance in
   the way of the Lord; and let us not despair because of the slender
   measure of success. How little soever the success may correspond with
   our wish, our labour is not lost when to-day is better than yesterday,
   provided with true singleness of mind we keep our aim, and aspire to
   the goal, not speaking flattering things to ourselves, nor indulging
   our vices, but making it our constant endeavour to become better, until
   we attain to goodness itself. If during the whole course of our life we
   seek and follow, we shall at length attain it, when relieved from the
   infirmity of flesh we are admitted to full fellowship with God.

                                  CHAPTER II.

    A SUMMARY OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. OF SELF-DENIAL. [5]

   The divisions of the chapter are,--I. The rule which permits us not to
   go astray in the study of righteousness, requires two things, viz.,
   that man, abandoning his own will, devote himself entirely to the
   service of God; whence it follows, that we must seek not our own
   things, but the things of God, sec. 1, 2. II. A description of this
   renovation or Christian life taken from the Epistle to Titus, and
   accurately explained under certain special heads, sec. 3 to end.

   1. ALTHOUGH the Law of God contains a perfect rule of conduct admirably
   arranged, it has seemed proper to our divine Master to train his people
   by a more accurate method, to the rule which is enjoined in the Law;
   and the leading principle in the method is, that it is the duty of
   believers to present their "bodies a living sacrifice, holy and
   acceptable unto God, which is their reasonable service," (Rom. xii. 1.)
   Hence he draws the exhortation: "Be not conformed to this world: but be
   ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
   that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God." The great point,
   then, is, that we are consecrated and dedicated to God, and, therefore,
   should not henceforth think, speak, design, or act, without a view to
   his glory. What he hath made sacred cannot, without signal insult to
   him, be applied to profane use. But if we are not our own, but the
   Lord's, it is plain both what error is to be shunned, and to what end
   the actions of our lives ought to be directed. We are not our own;
   therefore, neither is our own reason or will to rule our acts and
   counsels. We are not our own; therefore, let us not make it our end to
   seek what may be agreeable to our carnal nature. We are not our own;
   therefore, as far as possible, let us forget ourselves and the things
   that are ours. On the other hand, we are God's; let us, therefore, live
   and die to him (Rom. xiv. 8.) We are God's; therefore, let his wisdom
   and will preside over all our actions. We are God's; to him, then, as
   the only legitimate end, let every part of our life be directed. O how
   great the proficiency of him who, taught that he is not his own, has
   withdrawn the dominion and government of himself from his own reason
   that he may give them to God! For as the surest source of destruction
   to men is to obey themselves, so the only haven of safety is to have no
   other will, no other wisdom, than to follow the Lord wherever he leads.
   Let this, then be the first step, to abandon ourselves, and devote the
   whole energy of our minds to the service of God. By service, I mean not
   only that which consists in verbal obedience, but that by which the
   mind, divested of its own carnal feelings, implicitly obeys the call of
   the Spirit of God. This transformation, (which Paul calls the renewing
   of the mind, Rom. xii. 2; Eph. iv. 23.) though it is the first entrance
   to life, was unknown to all the philosophers. They give the government
   of man to reason alone, thinking that she alone is to be listened to;
   in short, they assign to her the sole direction of the conduct. But
   Christian philosophy bids her give place, and yield complete submission
   to the Holy Spirit, so that the man himself no longer lives, but Christ
   lives and reigns in him, (Gal. ii. 20.)

   2. Hence follows the other principle, that we are not to seek our own,
   but the Lord's will, and act with a view to promote his glory. Great is
   our proficiency, when, almost forgetting ourselves, certainly
   postponing our own reason, we faithfully make it our study to obey God
   and his commandments. For when Scripture enjoins us to lay aside
   private regard to ourselves, it not only divests our minds of an
   excessive longing for wealth, or power, or human favour, but eradicates
   all ambition and thirst for worldly glory, and other more secret pests.
   The Christian ought, indeed, to be so trained and disposed as to
   consider, that during his whole life he has to do with God. For this
   reason, as he will bring all things to the disposal and estimate of
   God, so he will religiously direct his whole mind to him. For he who
   has learned to look to God in everything he does, is at the same time
   diverted from all vain thoughts. This is that self-denial which Christ
   so strongly enforces on his disciples from the very outset, (Matth.
   xvi. 24,) which, as soon as it takes hold of the mind, leaves no place
   either, first, for pride, show, and ostentation; or, secondly, for
   avarice, lust, luxury, effeminacy, or other vices which are engendered
   by self love. On the contrary, wherever it reigns not, the foulest
   vices are indulged in without shame; or, if there is some appearance of
   virtue, it is vitiated by a depraved longing for applause. Show me, if
   you can, an individual who, unless he has renounced himself in
   obedience to the Lord's command, is disposed to do good for its own
   sake. Those who have not so renounced themselves have followed virtue
   at least for the sake of praise. The philosophers who have contended
   most strongly that virtue is to be desired on her own account, were so
   inflated with arrogance as to make it apparent that they sought virtue
   for no other reason than as a ground for indulging in pride. So far,
   therefore, is God from being delighted with these hunters after popular
   applause with their swollen breasts, that he declares they have
   received their reward in this world, (Matth. vi. 2,) and that harlots
   and publicans are nearer the kingdom of heaven than they, (Matth. xxi.
   31.) We have not yet sufficiently explained how great and numerous are
   the obstacles by which a man is impeded in the pursuit of rectitude, so
   long as he has not renounced himself. The old saying is true, There is
   a world of iniquity treasured up in the human soul. Nor can you find
   any other remedy for this than to deny yourself, renounce your own
   reason, and direct your whole mind to the pursuit of those things which
   the Lord requires of you, and which you are to seek only because they
   are pleasing to Him.

   3. In another passage, Paul gives a brief, indeed, but more distinct
   account of each of the parts of a well-ordered life: "The grace of God
   that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that,
   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
   righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed
   hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God and our Saviour
   Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works," (Tit. ii. 11-14.) After holding forth the grace of God to
   animate us, and pave the way for His true worship, he removes the two
   greatest obstacles which stand in the way, viz., ungodliness, to which
   we are by nature too prone, and worldly lusts, which are of still
   greater extent. Under ungodliness, he includes not merely superstition,
   but everything at variance with the true fear of God. Worldly lusts are
   equivalent to the lusts of the flesh. Thus he enjoins us, in regard to
   both tables of the Law, to lay aside our own mind, and renounce
   whatever our own reason and will dictate. Then he reduces all the
   actions of our lives to three branches, sobriety, righteousness, and
   godliness. Sobriety undoubtedly denotes as well chastity and temperance
   as the pure and frugal use of temporal goods, and patient endurance of
   want. Righteousness comprehends all the duties of equity, in every one
   his due. Next follows godliness, which separates us from the pollutions
   of the world, and connects us with God in true holiness. These, when
   connected together by an indissoluble chain, constitute complete
   perfection. But as nothing is more difficult than to bid adieu to the
   will of the flesh, subdue, nay, abjure our lusts, devote ourselves to
   God and our brethren, and lead an angelic life amid the pollutions of
   the world, Paul, to set our minds free from all entanglements, recalls
   us to the hope of a blessed immortality, justly urging us to contend,
   because as Christ has once appeared as our Redeemer, so on his final
   advent he will give full effect to the salvation obtained by him. And
   in this way he dispels all the allurements which becloud our path, and
   prevent us from aspiring as we ought to heavenly glory; nay, he tells
   us that we must be pilgrims in the world, that we may not fail of
   obtaining the heavenly inheritance.

   4. Moreover, we see by these words that self-denial has respect partly
   to men and partly (more especially) to God, (sec. 8-10.) For when
   Scripture enjoins us, in regard to our fellow men, to prefer them in
   honour to ourselves, and sincerely labour to promote their advantages
   (Rom. xii. 10; Phil. ii. 3,) he gives us commands which our mind is
   utterly incapable of obeying until its natural feelings are suppressed.
   For so blindly do we all rush in the direction of self-love, that every
   one thinks he has a good reason for exalting himself and despising all
   others in comparison. If God has bestowed on us something not to be
   repented of, trusting to it, we immediately become elated, and not only
   swell, but almost burst with pride. The vices with which we abound we
   both carefully conceal from others, and flatteringly represent to
   ourselves as minute and trivial, nay, sometimes hug them as virtues.
   When the same qualities which we admire in ourselves are seen in
   others, even though they should be superior, we, in order that we may
   not be forced to yield to them, maliciously lower and carp at them; in
   like manner, in the case of vices, not contented with severe and keen
   animadversion, we studiously exaggerate them. Hence the insolence with
   which each, as if exempted from the common lot, seeks to exalt himself
   above his neighbour, confidently and proudly despising others, or at
   least looking down upon them as his inferiors. The poor man yields to
   the rich, the plebeian to the noble, the servant to the master, the
   unlearned to the learned, and yet every one inwardly cherishes some
   idea of his own superiority. Thus each flattering himself, sets up a
   kind of kingdom in his breast; the arrogant, to satisfy themselves,
   pass censure on the minds and manners of other men, and when contention
   arises, the full venom is displayed. Many bear about with them some
   measure of mildness so long as all things go smoothly and lovingly with
   them, but how few are there who, when stung and irritated, preserve the
   same tenor of moderation? For this there is no other remedy than to
   pluck up by the roots those most noxious pests, self-love and love of
   victory. This the doctrine of Scripture does. For it teaches us to
   remember, that the endowments which God has bestowed upon us are not
   our own, but His free gifts, and that those who plume themselves upon
   them betray their ingratitude. "Who maketh thee to differ," saith Paul,
   "and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst
   receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?" (1
   Cor. iv. 7.) Then by a diligent examination of our faults let us keep
   ourselves humble. Thus while nothing will remain to swell our pride,
   there will be much to subdue it. Again, we are enjoined, whenever we
   behold the gifts of God in others, so to reverence and respect the
   gifts, as also to honour those in whom they reside. God having been
   pleased to bestow honour upon them, it would ill become us to deprive
   them of it. Then we are told to overlook their faults, not, indeed, to
   encourage by flattering them, but not because of them to insult those
   whom we ought to regard with honour and good will. [6] In this way,
   with regard to all with whom we have intercourse, our behaviour will be
   not only moderate and modest, but courteous and friendly. The only way
   by which you can ever attain to true meekness, is to have your heart
   imbued with a humble opinion of yourself and respect for others.

   5. How difficult it is to perform the duty of seeking the good of our
   neighbour! Unless you leave off all thought of yourself and in a manner
   cease to be yourself, you will never accomplish it. How can you exhibit
   those works of charity which Paul describes unless you renounce
   yourself, and become wholly devoted to others? "Charity (says he, 1
   Cor. xiii. 4) suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
   vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly,
   seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked &c. Were it the only thing
   required of us to seek not our own, nature would not have the least
   power to comply: she so inclines us to love ourselves only, that she
   will not easily allow us carelessly to pass by ourselves and our own
   interests that we may watch over the interests of others, nay,
   spontaneously to yield our own rights and resign it to another. But
   Scripture, to conduct us to this, reminds us, that whatever we obtain
   from the Lord is granted on the condition of our employing it for the
   common good of the Church, and that, therefore, the legitimate use of
   all our gifts is a kind and liberal communication of them with others.
   There cannot be a surer rule, nor a stronger exhortation to the
   observance of it, than when we are taught that all the endowments which
   we possess are divine deposits entrusted to us for the very purpose of
   being distributed for the good of our neighbour. But Scripture proceeds
   still farther when it likens these endowments to the different members
   of the body, (1 Cor. xii. 12.) No member has its function for itself,
   or applies it for its own private use, but transfers it to its
   fellow-members; nor does it derive any other advantage from it than
   that which it receives in common with the whole body. Thus, whatever
   the pious man can do, he is bound to do for his brethren, not
   consulting his own interest in any other way than by striving earnestly
   for the common edification of the Church. Let this, then, be our method
   of showing good-will and kindness, considering that, in regard to
   everything which God has bestowed upon us, and by which we can aid our
   neighbour, we are his stewards, and are bound to give account of our
   stewardship; moreover, that the only right mode of administration is
   that which is regulated by love. In this way, we shall not only unite
   the study of our neighbour's advantage with a regard to our own, but
   make the latter subordinate to the former. And lest we should have
   omitted to perceive that this is the law for duly administering every
   gift which we receive from God, he of old applied that law to the
   minutest expressions of his own kindness. He commanded the first-fruits
   to be offered to him as an attestation by the people that it was
   impious to reap any advantage from goods not previously consecrated to
   him, (Exod. xxii. 29; xxiii. 19.) But if the gifts of God are not
   sanctified to us until we have with our own hand dedicated them to the
   Giver, it must be a gross abuse that does not give signs of such
   dedication. It is in vain to contend that you cannot enrich the Lord by
   your offerings. Though, as the Psalmist says "Thou art my Lord: my
   goodness extendeth not unto thee," yet you can extend it "to the saints
   that are in the earth," (Ps. xvi. 2, 3;) and therefore a comparison is
   drawn between sacred oblations and alms as now corresponding to the
   offerings under the Law. [7]

   6. Moreover, that we may not weary in well-doing, (as would otherwise
   forthwith and infallibly be the case,) we must add the other quality in
   the Apostle's enumeration, "Charity suffiereth long, and is kind, is
   not easily provoked," (1 Cor. xiii. 4.) The Lord enjoins us to do good
   to all without exception, though the greater part, if estimated by
   their own merit, are most unworthy of it. But Scripture subjoins a most
   excellent reason, when it tells us that we are not to look to what men
   in themselves deserve, but to attend to the image of God, which exists
   in all, and to which we owe all honour and love. But in those who are
   of the household of faith, the same rule is to be more carefully
   observed, inasmuch as that image is renewed and restored in them by the
   Spirit of Christ. Therefore, whoever be the man that is presented to
   you as needing your assistance, you have no ground for declining to
   give it to him. Say he is a stranger. The Lord has given him a mark
   which ought to be familiar to you: for which reason he forbids you to
   despise your own flesh, (Gal. vi. 10.) Say he is mean and of no
   consideration. The Lord points him out as one whom he has distinguished
   by the lustre of his own image, (Isaiah lviii. 7.) Say that you are
   bound to him by no ties of duty. The Lord has substituted him as it
   were into his own place, that in him you may recognize the many great
   obligations under which the Lord has laid you to himself. Say that he
   is unworthy of your least exertion on his account; but the image of
   God, by which he is recommended to you, is worthy of yourself and all
   your exertions. But if he not only merits no good, but has provoked you
   by injury and mischief, still this is no good reason why you should not
   embrace him in love, and visit him with offices of love. He has
   deserved very differently from me, you will say. But what has the Lord
   deserved? [8] Whatever injury he has done you, when he enjoins you to
   forgive him, he certainly means that it should be imputed to himself.
   In this way only we attain to what is not to say difficult but
   altogether against nature, [9] to love those that hate us, render good
   for evil, and blessing for cursing, remembering that we are not to
   reflect on the wickedness of men, but look to the image of God in them,
   an image which, covering and obliterating their faults, should by its
   beauty and dignity allure us to love and embrace them.

   7. We shall thus succeed in mortifying ourselves if we fulfil all the
   duties of charity. Those duties, however, are not fulfilled by the mere
   discharge of them, though none be omitted, unless it is done from a
   pure feeling of love. For it may happen that one may perform every one
   of these offices, in so far as the external act is concerned, and be
   far from performing them aright. For you see some who would be thought
   very liberal, and yet accompany every thing they give with insult, by
   the haughtiness of their looks, or the violence of their words. And to
   such a calamitous condition have we come in this unhappy age, that the
   greater part of men never almost give alms without contumely. Such
   conduct ought not to have been tolerated even among the heathen; but
   from Christians something more is required than to carry cheerfulness
   in their looks, and give attractiveness to the discharge of their
   duties by courteous language. First, they should put themselves in the
   place of him whom they see in need of their assistance, and pity his
   misfortune as if they felt and bore it, so that a feeling of pity and
   humanity should incline them to assist him just as they would
   themselves. He who is thus minded will go and give assistance to his
   brethren, and not only not taint his acts with arrogance or upbraiding
   but will neither look down upon the brother to whom he does a kindness,
   as one who needed his help, or keep him in subjection as under
   obligation to him, just as we do not insult a diseased member when the
   rest of the body labours for its recovery, nor think it under special
   obligation to the other members, because it has required more exertion
   than it has returned. A communication of offices between members is not
   regarded as at all gratuitous, but rather as the payment of that which
   being due by the law of nature it were monstrous to deny. For this
   reason, he who has performed one kind of duty will not think himself
   thereby discharged, as is usually the case when a rich man, after
   contributing somewhat of his substance, delegates remaining burdens to
   others as if he had nothing to do with them. Every one should rather
   consider, that however great he is, he owes himself to his neighbours,
   and that the only limit to his beneficence is the failure of his means.
   The extent of these should regulate that of his charity.

   8. The principal part of self-denial, that which as we have said has
   reference to God, let us again consider more fully. Many things have
   already been said with regard to it which it were superfluous to
   repeat; and, therefore, it will be sufficient to view it as forming us
   to equanimity and endurance. First, then, in seeking the convenience or
   tranquillity of the present life, Scripture calls us to resign
   ourselves, and all we have, to the disposal of the Lord, to give him up
   the affections of our heart, that he may tame and subdue them. We have
   a frenzied desire, an infinite eagerness, to pursue wealth and honour,
   intrigue for power, accumulate riches, and collect all those
   frivolities which seem conducive to luxury and splendour. On the other
   hand, we have a remarkable dread, a remarkable hatred of poverty, mean
   birth, and a humble condition, and feel the strongest desire to guard
   against them. Hence, in regard to those who frame their life after
   their own counsel, we see how restless they are in mind, how many plans
   they try, to what fatigues they submit, in order that they may gain
   what avarice or ambition desires, or, on the other hand, escape poverty
   and meanness. To avoid similar entanglements, the course which
   Christian men must follow is this: first, they must not long for, or
   hope for, or think of any kind of prosperity apart from the blessing of
   God; on it they must cast themselves, and there safely and confidently
   recline. For, however much the carnal mind may seem sufficient for
   itself when in the pursuit of honour or wealth, it depends on its own
   industry and zeal, or is aided by the favour of men, it is certain that
   all this is nothing, and that neither intellect nor labour will be of
   the least avail, except in so far as the Lord prospers both. On the
   contrary, his blessing alone makes a way through all obstacles, and
   brings every thing to a joyful and favourable issue. Secondly, though
   without this blessing we may be able to acquire some degree of fame and
   opulence, (as we daily see wicked men loaded with honours and riches,)
   yet since those on whom the curse of God lies do not enjoy the least
   particle of true happiness, whatever we obtain without his blessing
   must turn out ill. But surely men ought not to desire what adds to
   their misery.

   9. Therefore, if we believe that all prosperous and desirable success
   depends entirely on the blessing of God, and that when it is wanting
   all kinds of misery and calamity await us, it follows that we should
   not eagerly contend for riches and honours, trusting to our own
   dexterity and assiduity, or leaning on the favour of men, or confiding
   in any empty imagination of fortune; but should always have respect to
   the Lord, that under his auspices we may be conducted to whatever lot
   he has provided for us. First, the result will be, that instead of
   rushing on regardless of right and wrong, by wiles and wicked arts, and
   with injury to our neighbours, to catch at wealth and seize upon
   honours, we will only follow such fortune as we may enjoy with
   innocence. Who can hope for the aid of the divine blessing amid fraud,
   rapine, and other iniquitous arts? As this blessing attends him only
   who thinks purely and acts uprightly, so it calls off all who long for
   it from sinister designs and evil actions. Secondly, a curb will be
   laid upon us, restraining a too eager desire of becoming rich, or an
   ambitious striving after honour. How can any one have the effrontery to
   expect that God will aid him in accomplishing desires at variance with
   his word? What God with his own lips pronounces cursed, never can be
   prosecuted with his blessing. Lastly, if our success is not equal to
   our wish and hope, we shall, however, be kept from impatience and
   detestation of our condition, whatever it be, knowing that so to feel
   were to murmur against God, at whose pleasure riches and poverty,
   contempt and honours, are dispensed. In shorts he who leans on the
   divine blessing in the way which has been described, will not, in the
   pursuit of those things which men are wont most eagerly to desire,
   employ wicked arts which he knows would avail him nothing; nor when any
   thing prosperous befalls him will he impute it to himself and his own
   diligence, or industry, or fortune, instead of ascribing it to God as
   its author. If, while the affairs of others flourish, his make little
   progress, or even retrograde, he will bear his humble lot with greater
   equanimity and moderation than any irreligious man does the moderate
   success which only falls short of what he wished; for he has a solace
   in which he can rest more tranquilly than at the very summit of wealth
   or power, because he considers that his affairs are ordered by the Lord
   in the manner most conducive to his salvation. This, we see, is the way
   in which David was affected, who, while he follows God and gives up
   himself to his guidance, declares, "Neither do I exercise myself in
   great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely I have behaved and
   quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother," (Ps. cxxxi. 1,
   2.)

   10. Nor is it in this respect only that pious minds ought to manifest
   this tranquillity and endurance; it must be extended to all the
   accidents to which this present life is liable. He alone, therefore,
   has properly denied himself, who has resigned himself entirely to the
   Lord, placing all the course of his life entirely at his disposal.
   Happen what may, he whose mind is thus composed will neither deem
   himself wretched nor murmur against God because of his lot. How
   necessary this disposition is will appear, if you consider the many
   accidents to which we are liable. Various diseases ever and anon attack
   us: at one time pestilence rages; at another we are involved in all the
   calamities of war. Frost and hail, destroying the promise of the year,
   cause sterility, which reduces us to penury; wife, parents, children,
   relatives, are carried off by death; our house is destroyed by fire.
   These are the events which make men curse their life, detest the day of
   their birth, execrate the light of heaven, even censure God, and (as
   they are eloquent in blasphemy) charge him with cruelty and injustice.
   The believer must in these things also contemplate the mercy and truly
   paternal indulgence of God. Accordingly, should he see his house by the
   removal of kindred reduced to solitude even then he will not cease to
   bless the Lord; his thought will be, Still the grace of the Lord, which
   dwells within my house, will not leave it desolate. If his crops are
   blasted, mildewed, or cut off by frost, or struck down by hail, [10]
   and he sees famine before him, he will not however despond or murmur
   against God, but maintain his confidence in him; "We thy people, and
   sheep of thy pasture, will give thee thanks for ever," (Ps. lxxix. 13;)
   he will supply me with food, even in the extreme of sterility. If he is
   afflicted with disease, the sharpness of the pain will not so overcome
   him, as to make him break out with impatience, and expostulate with
   God; but, recognising justice and lenity in the rod, will patiently
   endure. In short, whatever happens, knowing that it is ordered by the
   Lord, he will receive it with a placid and grateful mind, and will not
   contumaciously resist the government of him, at whose disposal he has
   placed himself and all that he has. Especially let the Christian breast
   eschew that foolish and most miserable consolation of the heathen, who,
   to strengthen their mind against adversity, imputed it to fortune, at
   which they deemed it absurd to feel indignant, as she was aimless and
   rash, and blindly wounded the good equally with the bad. On the
   contrary, the rule of piety is, that the hand of God is the ruler and
   arbiter of the fortunes of all, and, instead of rushing on with
   thoughtless violence, dispenses good and evil with perfect regularity.

                                  CHAPTER III.

    OF BEARING THE CROSS--ONE BRANCH OF SELF-DENIAL.

   The four divisions of this chapter are,--I. The nature of the cross,
   its necessity and dignity, sec. 1, 2. II. The manifold advantages of
   the cross described, sec. 3-6. III. The form of the cross the most
   excellent of all, and yet it by no means removes all sense of pain,
   sec. 7, 8. IV. A description of warfare under the cross, and of true
   patience, (not that of philosophers,) after the example of Christ, sec.
   9-11.

   1. THE pious mind must ascend still higher, namely, whither Christ
   calls his disciples when he says, that every one of them must "take up
   his cross," (Matth. xvi. 24.) Those whom the Lord has chosen and
   honoured with his intercourse must prepare for a hard, laborious,
   troubled life, a life full of many and various kinds of evils; it being
   the will of our heavenly Father to exercise his people in this way
   while putting them to the proof. Having begun this course with Christ
   the first-born, he continues it towards all his children. For though
   that Son was dear to him above others, the Son in whom he was "well
   pleased," yet we see, that far from being treated gently and
   indulgently, we may say, that not only was he subjected to a perpetual
   cross while he dwelt on earth, but his whole life was nothing else than
   a kind of perpetual cross. The Apostle assigns the reason, "Though he
   was a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered,"
   (Heb. v. 8.) Why then should we exempt ourselves from that condition to
   which Christ our Head behoved to submit; especially since he submitted
   on our account, that he might in his own person exhibit a model of
   patience? Wherefore, the Apostle declares, that all the children of God
   are destined to be conformed to him. Hence it affords us great
   consolation in hard and difficult circumstances, which men deem evil
   and adverse, to think that we are holding fellowship with the
   sufferings of Christ; that as he passed to celestial glory through a
   labyrinth of many woes, so we too are conducted thither through various
   tribulations. For, in another passage, Paul himself thus speaks, "we
   must through much tribulation enter the kingdom of God," (Acts xiv.
   22;) and again, "that I may know him, and the power of his
   resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made
   conformable unto his death," (Rom viii. 29.) How powerfully should it
   soften the bitterness of the cross, to think that the more we are
   afflicted with adversity, the surer we are made of our fellowship with
   Christ; by communion with whom our sufferings are not only blessed to
   us, but tend greatly to the furtherance of our salvation.

   2. We may add, that the only thing which made it necessary for our Lord
   to undertake to bear the cross, was to testify and prove his obedience
   to the Father; whereas there are many reasons which make it necessary
   for us to live constantly under the cross. Feeble as we are by nature,
   and prone to ascribe all perfection to our flesh, unless we receive as
   it were ocular demonstration of our weakness, we readily estimate our
   virtue above its proper worth, and doubt not that, whatever happens, it
   will stand unimpaired and invincible against all difficulties. Hence we
   indulge a stupid and empty confidence in the flesh, and then trusting
   to it wax proud against the Lord himself; as if our own faculties were
   sufficient without his grace. This arrogance cannot be better repressed
   than when He proves to us by experience, not only how great our
   weakness, but also our frailty is. Therefore, he visits us with
   disgrace, or poverty, or bereavement, or disease, or other afflictions.
   Feeling altogether unable to support them, we forthwith, in so far as
   regards ourselves, give way, and thus humbled learn to invoke his
   strength, which alone can enable us to bear up under a weight of
   affliction. Nay, even the holiest of men, however well aware that they
   stand not in their own strength, but by the grace of God, would feel
   too secure in their own fortitude and constancy, were they not brought
   to a more thorough knowledge of themselves by the trial of the cross.
   This feeling gained even upon David, "In my prosperity I Said, I shall
   never be moved. Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
   strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled," (Ps. xxx. 6, 7.)
   He confesses that in prosperity his feelings were dulled and blunted,
   so that, neglecting the grace of God, on which alone he ought to have
   depended, he leant to himself, and promised himself perpetuity. If it
   so happened to this great prophet, who of us should not fear and study
   caution? Though in tranquillity they flatter themselves with the idea
   of greater constancy and patience, yet, humbled by adversity, they
   learn the deception. Believers, I say, warned by such proofs of their
   diseases, make progress in humility, and, divesting themselves of a
   depraved confidence in the flesh, betake themselves to the grace of
   God, and, when they have so betaken themselves, experience the presence
   of the divine power, in which is ample protection.

   3. This Paul teaches when he says that tribulation worketh patience,
   and patience experience. God having promised that he will be with
   believers in tribulation, they feel the truth of the promise; while
   supported by his hand, they endure patiently. This they could never do
   by their own strength. Patience, therefore, gives the saints an
   experimental proof that God in reality furnishes the aid which he has
   promised whenever there is need. Hence also their faith is confirmed,
   for it were very ungrateful not to expect that in future the truth of
   God will be, as they have already found it, firm and constant. We now
   see how many advantages are at once produced by the cross. Overturning
   the overweening opinion we form of our own virtue, and detecting the
   hypocrisy in which we delight, it removes our pernicious carnal
   confidence, teaching us, when thus humbled, to recline on God alone, so
   that we neither are oppressed nor despond. Then victory is followed by
   hope, inasmuch as the Lord, by performing what he has promised,
   establishes his truth in regard to the future. Were these the only
   reasons, it is surely plain how necessary it is for us to bear the
   cross. It is of no little importance to be rid of your self-love, and
   made fully conscious of your weakness; so impressed with a sense of
   your weakness as to learn to distrust yourself--to distrust yourself so
   as to transfer your confidence to God, reclining on him with such
   heartfelt confidence as to trust in his aid, and continue invincible to
   the end, standing by his grace so as to perceive that he is true to his
   promises, and so assured of the certainty of his promises as to be
   strong in hope.

   4. Another end which the Lord has in afflicting his people is to try
   their patience, and train them to obedience--not that they can yield
   obedience to him except in so far as he enables them; but he is pleased
   thus to attest and display striking proofs of the graces which he has
   conferred upon his saints, lest they should remain within unseen and
   unemployed. Accordingly, by bringing forward openly the strength and
   constancy of endurance with which he has provided his servants, he is
   said to try their patience. Hence the expressions that God tempted
   Abraham, (Gen. xxi. 1, 12,) and made proof of his piety by not
   declining to sacrifice his only son. Hence, too, Peter tells us that
   our faith is proved by tribulation, just as gold is tried in a furnace
   of fire. But who will say it is not expedient that the most excellent
   gift of patience which the believer has received from his God should be
   applied to uses by being made sure and manifest? Otherwise men would
   never value it according to its worth. But if God himself, to prevent
   the virtues which he has conferred upon believers from lurking in
   obscurity, nay, lying useless and perishing, does aright in supplying
   materials for calling them forth, there is the best reason for the
   afflictions of the saints, since without them their patience could not
   exist. I say, that by the cross they are also trained to obedience,
   because they are thus taught to live not according to their own wish,
   but at the disposal of God. Indeed, did all things proceed as they
   wish, they would not know what it is to follow God. Seneca mentions (De
   Vit. Beata, cap. xv.) that there was an old proverb when any one was
   exhorted to endure adversity, "Follow God;#8221; thereby intimating,
   that men truly submitted to the yoke of God only when they gave their
   back and hand to his rod. But if it is most right that we should in all
   things prove our obedience to our heavenly Father, certainly we ought
   not to decline any method by which he trains us to obedience.

   5. Still, however, we see not how necessary that obedience is, unless
   we at the same time consider how prone our carnal nature is to shake
   off the yoke of God whenever it has been treated with some degree of
   gentleness and indulgence. It just happens to it as with refractory
   horses, which, if kept idle for a few days at hack and manger, become
   ungovernable, and no longer recognize the rider, whose command before
   they implicitly obeyed. And we invariably become what God complains of
   in the people of Israel--waxing gross and fat, we kick against him who
   reared and nursed us, (Deut. xxxii. 15.) The kindness of God should
   allure us to ponder and love his goodness; but since such is our
   malignity, that we are invariably corrupted by his indulgence, it is
   more than necessary for us to be restrained by discipline from breaking
   forth into such petulance. Thus, lest we become emboldened by an
   over-abundance of wealth; lest elated with honour, we grow proud; lest
   inflated with other advantages of body, or mind, or fortune, we grow
   insolent, the Lord himself interferes as he sees to be expedient by
   means of the cross, subduing and curbing the arrogance of our flesh,
   and that in various ways, as the advantage of each requires. For as we
   do not all equally labour under the same disease, so we do not all need
   the same difficult cure. Hence we see that all are not exercised with
   the same kind of cross. While the heavenly Physician treats some more
   gently, in the case of others he employs harsher remedies, his purpose
   being to provide a cure for all. Still none is left free and untouched,
   because he knows that all, without a single exception, are diseased.

   6. We may add, that our most merciful Father requires not only to
   prevent our weakness, but often to correct our past faults, that he may
   keep us in due obedience. Therefore, whenever we are afflicted we ought
   immediately to call to mind our past life. In this way we will find
   that the faults which we have committed are deserving of such
   castigation. And yet the exhortation to patience is not to be founded
   chiefly on the acknowledgment of sin. For Scripture supplies a far
   better consideration when it says, that in adversity "we are chastened
   of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world," (1 Cor.
   xi. 32.) Therefore, in the very bitterness of tribulation we ought to
   recognise the kindness and mercy of our Father, since even then he
   ceases not to further our salvation. For he afflicts, not that he may
   ruin or destroy but rather that he may deliver us from the condemnation
   of the world. Let this thought lead us to what Scripture elsewhere
   teaches: "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be
   weary of his correction: For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even
   as a father the son in whom he delighteth," (Prov. iii. 11, 12.) When
   we perceive our Father's rod, is it not our part to behave as obedient
   docile sons rather than rebelliously imitate desperate men, who are
   hardened in wickedness? God dooms us to destruction, if he does not, by
   correction, call us back when we have fallen off from him, so that it
   is truly said, "If ye be without chastisement," "then are ye bastards,
   and not sons," (Heb. xii. 8.) We are most perverse then if we cannot
   bear him while he is manifesting his good-will to us, and the care
   which he takes of our salvation. Scripture states the difference
   between believers and unbelievers to be, that the latter, as the slaves
   of inveterate and deep-seated iniquity, only become worse and more
   obstinate under the lash; whereas the former, like free-born sons turn
   to repentance. Now, therefore, choose your class. But as I have already
   spoken of this subject, it is sufficient to have here briefly adverted
   to it.

   7. There is singular consolation, moreover, when we are persecuted for
   righteousness' sake. For our thought should then be, How high the
   honour which God bestows upon us in distinguishing us by the special
   badge of his soldiers. By suffering persecution for righteousness'
   sake, I mean not only striving for the defence of the Gospel, but for
   the defence of righteousness in any way. Whether, therefore, in
   maintaining the truth of God against the lies of Satan, or defending
   the good and innocent against the injuries of the bad, we are obliged
   to incur the offence and hatred of the world, so as to endanger life,
   fortune, or honour, let us not grieve or decline so far to spend
   ourselves for God; let us not think ourselves wretched in those things
   in which he with his own lips has pronounced us blessed, (Matth. v.
   10.) Poverty, indeed considered in itself, is misery; so are exile,
   contempt, imprisonment, ignominy: in fine, death itself is the last of
   all calamities. But when the favour of God breathes upon is, there is
   none of these things which may not turn out to our happiness. Let us
   then be contented with the testimony of Christ rather than with the
   false estimate of the flesh, and then, after the example of the
   Apostles, we will rejoice in being "counted worthy to suffer shame for
   his name," (Acts v. 41.) For why? If, while conscious of our innocence,
   we are deprived of our substance by the wickedness of man, we are, no
   doubt, humanly speaking, reduced to poverty; but in truth our riches in
   heaven are increased: if driven from our homes we have a more welcome
   reception into the family of God; if vexed and despised, we are more
   firmly rooted in Christ; if stigmatised by disgrace and ignominy, we
   have a higher place in the kingdom of God; and if we are slain,
   entrance is thereby given us to eternal life. The Lord having set such
   a price upon us, let us be ashamed to estimate ourselves at less than
   the shadowy and evanescent allurements of the present life.

   8. Since by these, and similar considerations, Scripture abundantly
   solaces us for the ignominy or calamities which we endure in defence of
   righteousness, we are very ungrateful if we do not willingly and
   cheerfully receive them at the hand of the Lord, especially since this
   form of the cross is the most appropriate to believers, being that by
   which Christ desires to be glorified in us, as Peter also declares, (1
   Pet. iv. 11, 14.) But as to ingenuous natures, it is more bitter to
   suffer disgrace than a hundred deaths, Paul expressly reminds us that
   not only persecution, but also disgrace awaits us, "because we trust in
   the living God," (1 Tim. iv. 10.) So in another passage he bids us,
   after his example, walk "by evil report and good report," (2 Cor. vi.
   8.) The cheerfulness required, however, does not imply a total
   insensibility to pain. The saints could show no patience under the
   cross if they were not both tortured with pain and grievously molested.
   Were there no hardship in poverty, no pain in disease, no sting in
   ignominy, no fear in death, where would be the fortitude and moderation
   in enduring them? But while every one of these, by its inherent
   bitterness, naturally vexes the mind, the believer in this displays his
   fortitude, that though fully sensible of the bitterness and labouring
   grievously, he still withstands and struggles boldly; in this displays
   his patience, that though sharply stung, he is however curbed by the
   fear of God from breaking forth into any excess; in this displays his
   alacrity, that though pressed with sorrow and sadness, he rests
   satisfied with spiritual consolation from God.

   9. This conflict which believers maintain against the natural feeling
   of pain, while they study moderation and patience, Paul elegantly
   describes in these words: "We are troubled on every side, yet not
   distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not
   forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed," (2 Cor. iv. 8, 9.) You see
   that to bear the cross patiently is not to have your feelings
   altogether blunted, and to be absolutely insensible to pain, according
   to the absurd description which the Stoics of old gave of their hero as
   one who, divested of humanity, was affected in the same way by
   adversity and prosperity, grief and joy; or rather, like a stone, was
   not affected by anything. And what did they gain by that sublime
   wisdom? they exhibited a shadow of patience, which never did, and never
   can, exist among men. Nay, rather by aiming at a too exact and rigid
   patience, they banished it altogether from human life. Now also we have
   among Christians a new kind of Stoics, who hold it vicious not only to
   groan and weep, but even to be sad and anxious. These paradoxes are
   usually started by indolent men who, employing themselves more in
   speculation than in action, can do nothing else for us than beget such
   paradoxes. But we have nothing to do with that iron philosophy which
   our Lord and Master condemned--not only in word, but also by his own
   example. For he both grieved and shed tears for his own and others'
   woes. Nor did he teach his disciples differently: "Ye shall weep and
   lament, but the world shall rejoice," (John xvi. 20.) And lest any one
   should regard this as vicious, he expressly declares, "Blessed are they
   that mourn," (Matth. v. 4.) And no wonder. If all tears are condemned,
   what shall we think of our Lord himself, whose "sweat was as it were
   great drops of blood falling down to the ground?" (Luke xxii. 44;
   Matth. xxvi. 38.) If every kind of fear is a mark of unbelief, what
   place shall we assign to the dread which, it is said, in no slight
   degree amazed him; if all sadness is condemned, how shall we justify
   him when he confesses, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
   death?"

   10. I wished to make these observations to keep pious minds from
   despair, lest, from feeling it impossible to divest themselves of the
   natural feeling of grief, they might altogether abandon the study of
   patience. This must necessarily be the result with those who convert
   patience into stupor, and a brave and firm man into a block. Scripture
   gives saints the praise of endurance when, though afflicted by the
   hardships they endure, they are not crushed; though they feel bitterly,
   they are at the same time filled with spiritual joy; though pressed
   with anxiety, breathe exhilarated by the consolation of God. Still
   there is a certain degree of repugnance in their hearts, because
   natural sense shuns and dreads what is adverse to it, while pious
   affection, even through these difficulties, tries to obey the divine
   will. This repugnance the Lord expressed when he thus addressed Peter:
   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst
   thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldst; but when thou shalt be old,
   thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee; and
   carry thee whither thou wouldest not," (John xxi. 18.) It is not
   probable, indeed, that when it became necessary to glorify God by death
   he was driven to it unwilling and resisting; had it been so, little
   praise would have been due to his martyrdom. But though he obeyed the
   divine ordination with the greatest alacrity of heart, yet, as he had
   not divested himself of humanity, he was distracted by a double will.
   When he thought of the bloody death which he was to die, struck with
   horror, he would willingly have avoided it: on the other hand, when he
   considered that it was God who called him to it, his fear was
   vanquished and suppressed, and he met death cheerfully. It must
   therefore be our study, if we would be disciples of Christ, to imbue
   our minds with such reverence and obedience to God as may tame and
   subjugate all affections contrary to his appointment. In this way,
   whatever be the kind of cross to which we are subjected, we shall in
   the greatest straits firmly maintain our patience. Adversity will have
   its bitterness, and sting us. When afflicted with disease, we shall
   groan and be disquieted, and long for health; pressed with poverty, we
   shall feel the stings of anxiety and sadness, feel the pain of
   ignominy, contempt, and injury, and pay the tears due to nature at the
   death of our friends: but our conclusion will always be, The Lord so
   willed it, therefore let us follow his will. Nay, amid the pungency of
   grief, among groans and tears this thought will necessarily suggest
   itself and incline us cheerfully to endure the things for which we are
   so afflicted.

   11. But since the chief reason for enduring the cross has been derived
   from a consideration of the divine will, we must in few words explain
   wherein lies the difference between philosophical and Christian
   patience. Indeed, very few of the philosophers advanced so far as to
   perceive that the hand of God tries us by means of affliction, and that
   we ought in this matter to obey God. The only reason which they adduce
   is, that so it must be. But is not this just to say, that we must yield
   to God, because it is in vain to contend against him? For if we obey
   God only because it is necessary, provided we can escape, we shall
   cease to obey him. But what Scripture calls us to consider in the will
   of God is very different, namely, first justice and equity, and then a
   regard to our own salvation. Hence Christian exhortations to patience
   are of this nature, Whether poverty, or exile, or imprisonment, or
   contumely, or disease, or bereavement, or any such evil affects us, we
   must think that none of them happens except by the will and providence
   of God; moreover, that every thing he does is in the most perfect
   order. What! do not our numberless daily faults deserve to be
   chastised, more severely, and with a heavier rod than his mercy lays
   upon us? Is it not most right that our flesh should be subdued, and be,
   as it were, accustomed to the yoke, so as not to rage and wanton as it
   lists? Are not the justice and the truth of God worthy of our suffering
   on their account? [11] But if the equity of God is undoubtedly
   displayed in affliction, we cannot murmur or struggle against them
   without iniquity. We no longer hear the frigid cant, Yield, because it
   is necessary; but a living and energetic precept, Obey, because it is
   unlawful to resist; bear patiently, because impatience is rebellion
   against the justice of God. Then as that only seems to us attractive
   which we perceive to be for our own safety and advantage, here also our
   heavenly Father consoles us, by the assurance, that in the very cross
   with which he afflicts us he provides for our salvation. But if it is
   clear that tribulations are salutary to us, why should we not receive
   them with calm and grateful minds? In bearing them patiently we are not
   submitting to necessity but resting satisfied with our own good. The
   effect of these thoughts is, that to whatever extent our minds are
   contracted by the bitterness which we naturally feel under the cross,
   to the same extent will they be expanded with spiritual joy. Hence
   arises thanksgiving, which cannot exist unless joy be felt. But if the
   praise of the Lord and thanksgiving can emanate only from a cheerful
   and gladdened breasts and there is nothing which ought to interrupt
   these feelings in us, it is clear how necessary it is to temper the
   bitterness of the cross with spiritual joy.

                                  CHAPTER IV.

    OF MEDITATING ON THE FUTURE LIFE.

   The three divisions of this chapter,--I. The principal use of the cross
   is, that it in various ways accustoms us to despise the present, and
   excites us to aspire to the future life, sec. 1, 2. II. In withdrawing
   from the present life we must neither shun it nor feel hatred for it;
   but desiring the future life, gladly quit the present at the command of
   our sovereign Master, see. 3, 4. III. Our infirmity in dreading death
   described. The correction and safe remedy, sec. 6.

   1. WHATEVER be the kind of tribulation with which we are afflicted, we
   should always consider the end of it to be, that we may be trained to
   despise the present, and thereby stimulated to aspire to the future
   life. For since God well knows how strongly we are inclined by nature
   to a slavish love of this world, in order to prevent us from clinging
   too strongly to it, he employs the fittest reason for calling us back,
   and shaking off our lethargy. Every one of us, indeed, would be thought
   to aspire and aim at heavenly immortality during the whole course of
   his life. For we would be ashamed in no respect to excel the lower
   animals; whose condition would not be at all inferior to ours, had we
   not a hope of immortality beyond the grave. But when you attend to the
   plans, wishes, and actions of each, you see nothing in them but the
   earth. Hence our stupidity; our minds being dazzled with the glare of
   wealth, power, and honours, that they can see no farther. The heart
   also, engrossed with avarice, ambition, and lust, is weighed down and
   cannot rise above them. In short, the whole soul, ensnared by the
   allurements of the flesh, seeks its happiness on the earth. To meet
   this disease, the Lord makes his people sensible of the vanity of the
   present life, by a constant proof of its miseries. Thus, that they may
   not promise themselves deep and lasting peace in it, he often allows
   them to be assailed by war, tumult, or rapine, or to be disturbed by
   other injuries. That they may not long with too much eagerness after
   fleeting and fading riches, or rest in those which they already
   possess, he reduces them to want, or, at least, restricts them to a
   moderate allowance, at one time by exile, at another by sterility, at
   another by fire, or by other means. That they may not indulge too
   complacently in the advantages of married life, he either vexes them by
   the misconduct of their partners, or humbles them by the wickedness of
   their children, or afflicts them by bereavement. But if in all these he
   is indulgent to them, lest they should either swell with vain-glory, or
   be elated with confidence, by diseases and dangers he sets palpably
   before them how unstable and evanescent are all the advantages
   competent to mortals. We duly profit by the discipline of the cross,
   when we learn that this life, estimated in itself, is restless,
   troubled, in numberless ways wretched, and plainly in no respect happy;
   that what are estimated its blessings are uncertain, fleeting, vain,
   and vitiated by a great admixture of evil. From this we conclude, that
   all we have to seek or hope for here is contest; that when we think of
   the crown we must raise our eyes to heaven. For we must hold, that our
   mind never rises seriously to desire and aspire after the future, until
   it has learned to despise the present life.

   2. For there is no medium between the two things: the earth must either
   be worthless in our estimation, or keep us enslaved by an intemperate
   love of it. Therefore, if we have any regard to eternity, we must
   carefully strive to disencumber ourselves of these fetters. Moreover,
   since the present life has many enticements to allure us, and great
   semblance of delight, grace, and sweetness to soothe us, it is of great
   consequence to us to be now and then called off from its fascinations.
   [12] For what, pray, would happen, if we here enjoyed an uninterrupted
   course of honour and felicity, when even the constant stimulus of
   affliction cannot arouse us to a due sense of our misery? That human
   life is like smoke or a shadow, is not only known to the learned; there
   is not a more trite proverb among the vulgar. Considering it a fact
   most useful to be known, they have recommended it in many well-known
   expressions. Still there is no fact which we ponder less carefully, or
   less frequently remember. For we form all our plans just as if we had
   fixed our immortality on the earth. If we see a funeral, or walk among
   graves, as the image of death is then present to the eye, I admit we
   philosophise admirably on the vanity of life. We do not indeed always
   do so, for those things often have no effect upon us at all. But, at
   the best, our philosophy is momentary. It vanishes as soon as we turn
   our back, and leaves not the vestige of remembrance behind; in short,
   it passes away, just like the applause of a theatre at some pleasant
   spectacle. Forgetful not only of death, but also of mortality itself,
   as if no rumour of it had ever reached us, we indulge in supine
   security as expecting a terrestrial immortality. Meanwhile, if any one
   breaks in with the proverb, that man is the creature of a day, [13] we
   indeed acknowledge its truth, but, so far from giving heed to it, the
   thought of perpetuity still keeps hold of our minds. Who then can deny
   that it is of the highest importance to us all, I say not, to be
   admonished by words, but convinced by all possible experience of the
   miserable condition of our earthly life; since even when convinced we
   scarcely cease to gaze upon it with vicious, stupid admiration, as if
   it contained within itself the sum of all that is good? But if God
   finds it necessary so to train us, it must be our duty to listen to him
   when he calls, and shakes us from our torpor, that we may hasten to
   despise the world, and aspire with our whole heart to the future life.

   3. Still the contempt which believers should train themselves to feel
   for the present life, must not be of a kind to beget hatred of it or
   ingratitude to God. This life, though abounding in all kinds of
   wretchedness, is justly classed among divine blessings which are not to
   be despised. Wherefore, if we do not recognize the kindness of God in
   it, we are chargeable with no little ingratitude towards him. To
   believers, especially, it ought to be a proof of divine benevolence,
   since it is wholly destined to promote their salvation. Before openly
   exhibiting the inheritance of eternal glory, God is pleased to manifest
   himself to us as a Father by minor proofs, viz., the blessings which he
   daily bestows upon us. Therefore, while this life serves to acquaint us
   with the goodness of God, shall we disdain it as if it did not contain
   one particle of good? We ought, therefore, to feel and be affected
   towards it in such a manner as to place it among those gifts of the
   divine benignity which are by no means to be despised. Were there no
   proofs in Scripture, (they are most numerous and clear,) yet nature
   herself exhorts us to return thanks to God for having brought us forth
   into light, granted us the use of it, and bestowed upon us all the
   means necessary for its preservation. And there is a much higher reason
   when we reflect that here we are in a manner prepared for the glory of
   the heavenly kingdom. For the Lord hath ordained, that those who are
   ultimately to be crowned in heaven must maintain a previous warfare on
   the earth, that they may not triumph before they have overcome the
   difficulties of war, and obtained the victory. Another reason is, that
   we here begin to experience in various ways a foretaste of the divine
   benignity, in order that our hope and desire may be whetted for its
   full manifestation. When once we have concluded that our earthly life
   is a gift of the divine mercy, of which, agreeably to our obligation,
   it behoves us to have a grateful remembrance, we shall then properly
   descend to consider its most wretched condition, and thus escape from
   that excessive fondness for it, to which, as I have said, we are
   naturally prone.

   4. In proportion as this improper love diminishes, our desire of a
   better life should increase. I confess, indeed, that a most accurate
   opinion was formed by those who thought, that the best thing was not to
   be born, the next best to die early. For, being destitute of the light
   of God and of true religion, what could they see in it that was not of
   dire and evil omen? Nor was it unreasonable for those [14] who felt
   sorrow and shed tears at the birth of their kindred, to keep holiday at
   their deaths. But this they did without profit; because, devoid of the
   true doctrine of faith, they saw not how that which in itself is
   neither happy nor desirable turns to the advantage of the righteous:
   and hence their opinion issued in despair. Let believers, then, in
   forming an estimate of this mortal life, and perceiving that in itself
   it is nothing but misery, make it their aim to exert themselves with
   greater alacrity, and less hinderance, in aspiring to the future and
   eternal life. When we contrast the two, the former may not only be
   securely neglected, but, in comparison of the latter, be disdained and
   contemned. If heaven is our country, what can the earth be but a place
   of exile? If departure from the world is entrance into life, what is
   the world but a sepulchre, and what is residence in it but immersion in
   death? If to be freed from the body is to gain full possession of
   freedom, what is the body but a prison? If it is the very summit of
   happiness to enjoy the presence of God, is it not miserable to want it?
   But "whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord,"
   (2 Cor. v. 6.) Thus when the earthly is compared with the heavenly
   life, it may undoubtedly be despised and trampled under foot. We ought
   never, indeed, to regard it with hatred, except in so far as it keeps
   us subject to sin; and even this hatred ought not to be directed
   against life itself. At all events, we must stand so affected towards
   it in regard to weariness or hatred as, while longing for its
   termination, to be ready at the Lord's will to continue in it, keeping
   far from everything like murmuring and impatience. For it is as if the
   Lord had assigned us a post, which we must maintain till he recalls us.
   Paul, indeed, laments his condition, in being still bound with the
   fetters of the body, and sighs earnestly for redemption, (Rom. vii.
   24;) nevertheless, he declared that, in obedience to the command of
   Gods he was prepared for both courses, because he acknowledges it as
   his duty to God to glorify his name whether by life or by death, while
   it belongs to God to determine what is most conducive to His glory,
   (Phil. i. 20-24.) Wherefore, if it becomes us to live and die to the
   Lord, let us leave the period of our life and death at his disposal.
   Still let us ardently long for death, and constantly meditate upon it,
   and in comparison with future immortality, let us despise life, and, on
   account of the bondage of sin, long to renounce it whenever it shall so
   please the Lord.

   5. But, most strange to say, many who boast of being Christians,
   instead of thus longing for death, are so afraid of it that they
   tremble at the very mention of it as a thing ominous and dreadful. We
   cannot wonder, indeed, that our natural feelings should be somewhat
   shocked at the mention of our dissolution. But it is altogether
   intolerable that the light of piety should not be so powerful in a
   Christian breast as with greater consolation to overcome and suppress
   that fear. For if we reflect that this our tabernacle, unstable,
   defective, corruptible, fading, pining, and putrid, is dissolved, in
   order that it may forthwith be renewed in sure, perfect, incorruptible,
   in fine, in heavenly glory, will not faith compel us eagerly to desire
   what nature dreads? If we reflect that by death we are recalled from
   exile to inhabit our native country, a heavenly country, shall this
   give us no comfort? But everything longs for permanent existence. I
   admit this, and therefore contend that we ought to look to future
   immortality, where we may obtain that fixed condition which nowhere
   appears on the earth. For Paul admirably enjoins believers to hasten
   cheerfully to death, not because they a would be unclothed, but clothed
   upon," (2 Cor. v. 2.) Shall the lower animals, and inanimate creatures
   themselves even wood and stone, as conscious of their present vanity,
   long for the final resurrection, that they may with the sons of God be
   delivered from vanity, (Rom. viii. 19;) and shall we, endued with the
   light of intellect, and more than intellect, enlightened by the Spirit
   of God, when our essence is in question, rise no higher than the
   corruption of this earth? But it is not my purpose, nor is this the
   place, to plead against this great perverseness. At the outset, I
   declared that I had no wish to engage in a diffuse discussion of
   common-places. My advice to those whose minds are thus timid is to read
   the short treatise of Cyprian De Mortalitate, unless it be more
   accordant with their deserts to send them to the philosophers, that by
   inspecting what they say on the contempt of death, they may begin to
   blush. This, however let us hold as fixed, that no man has made much
   progress in the school of Christ who does not look forward with joy to
   the day of death and final resurrection, (2 Tim. iv. 18; Tit. ii. 13:)
   for Paul distinguishes all believers by this mark; and the usual course
   of Scripture is to direct us thither whenever it would furnish us with
   an argument for substantial joy. "Look up," says our Lord, "and lift up
   your heads: for your redemption draweth nigh," (Luke xxi. 28.) Is it
   reasonable, I ask, that what he intended to have a powerful effect in
   stirring us up to alacrity and exultation should produce nothing but
   sadness and consternation? If it is so, why do we still glory in him as
   our Master? Therefore, let us come to a sounder mind, and how repugnant
   so ever the blind and stupid longing of the flesh may be, let us doubt
   not to desire the advent of the Lord not in wish only, but with earnest
   sighs, as the most propitious of all events. He will come as a Redeemer
   to deliver us from an immense abyss of evil and misery, and lead us to
   the blessed inheritance of his life and glory.

   6. Thus, indeed, it is; the whole body of the faithful, so long as they
   live on the earth, must be like sheep for the slaughter, in order that
   they may be conformed to Christ their head, (Rom. viii. 36.) Most
   deplorable, therefore, would their situation be did they not, by
   raising their mind to heaven, become superior to all that is in the
   world, and rise above the present aspect of affairs, (1 Cor. xv. l9.)
   On the other hand, when once they have raised their head above all
   earthly objects, though they see the wicked flourishing in wealth and
   honour, and enjoying profound peace, indulging in luxury and splendour,
   and revelling in all kinds of delights, though they should moreover be
   wickedly assailed by them, suffer insult from their pride, be robbed by
   their avarice, or assailed by any other passion, they will have no
   difficulty in bearing up under these evils. They will turn their eye to
   that day, (Isaiah xxv. 8; Rev. vii. 17,) on which the Lord will receive
   his faithful servants, wipe away all tears from their eyes, clothe them
   in a robe of glory and joy, feed them with the ineffable sweetness of
   his pleasures, exalt them to share with him in his greatness; in fine,
   admit them to a participation in his happiness. But the wicked who may
   have flourished on the earth, he will cast forth in extreme ignominy,
   will change their delights into torments, their laughter and joy into
   wailing and gnashing of teeth, their peace into the gnawing of
   conscience, and punish their luxury with unquenchable fire. He will
   also place their necks under the feet of the godly, whose patience they
   abused. For, as Paul declares, "it is a righteous thing with God to
   recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are
   troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
   heaven," (2 Thess. i. 6, 7.) This, indeed, is our only consolation;
   deprived of it, we must either give way to despondency, or resort to
   our destruction to the vain solace of the world. The Psalmist
   confesses, "My feet were almost gone: my steps had well nigh slipt: for
   I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked,"
   (Psalm lxxiii. 3, 4;) and he found no resting-place until he entered
   the sanctuary, and considered the latter end of the righteous and the
   wicked. To conclude in one word, the cross of Christ then only triumphs
   in the breasts of believers over the devil and the flesh, sin and
   sinners, when their eyes are directed to the power of his resurrection.

                                   CHAPTER V.

    HOW TO USE THE PRESENT LIFE, AND THE COMFORTS OF IT.

   The divisions of this chapter are,--I. The necessity and usefulness of
   this doctrine. Extremes to be avoided, if we would rightly use the
   present life and its comforts, sec. 1, 2. II. One of these extremes,
   viz, the intemperance of the flesh, to be carefully avoided. Four
   methods of doing so described in order, sec. 3-6.

   1. BY such rudiments we are at the same time well instructed by
   Scripture in the proper use of earthly blessings, a subject which, in
   forming a scheme of life, is by no mean to be neglected. For if we are
   to live, we must use the necessary supports of life; nor can we even
   shun those things which seem more subservient to delight than to
   necessity. We must therefore observe a mean, that we may use them with
   a pure conscience, whether for necessity or for pleasure. This the Lord
   prescribes by his word, when he tells us that to his people the present
   life is a kind of pilgrimage by which they hasten to the heavenly
   kingdom. If we are only to pass through the earth, there can be no
   doubt that we are to use its blessings only in so far as they assist
   our progress, rather than retard it. Accordingly, Paul, not without
   cause, admonishes us to use this world without abusing it, and to buy
   possessions as if we were selling them, (1 Cor. vii. 30, 31.) But as
   this is a slippery place, and there is great danger of falling on
   either side, let us fix our feet where we can stand safely. There have
   been some good and holy men who, when they saw intemperance and luxury
   perpetually carried to excess, if not strictly curbed, and were
   desirous to correct so pernicious an evil, imagined that there was no
   other method than to allow man to use corporeal goods only in so far as
   they were necessaries: a counsel pious indeed, but unnecessarily
   austere; for it does the very dangerous thing of binding consciences in
   closer fetters than those in which they are bound by the word of God.
   Moreover, necessity, according to them, [15] was abstinence from every
   thing which could be wanted, so that they held it scarcely lawful to
   make any addition to bread and water. Others were still more austere,
   as is related of Cratetes the Theban, who threw his riches into the
   sea, because he thought, that unless he destroyed them they would
   destroy him. Many also in the present day, while they seek a pretext
   for carnal intemperance in the use of external things, and at the same
   time would pave the way for licentiousness, assume for granted, what I
   by no means concede, that this liberty is not to be restrained by any
   modification, but that it is to be left to every man's conscience to
   use them as far as he thinks lawful. I indeed confess that here
   consciences neither can nor ought to be bound by fixed and definite
   laws; but that Scripture having laid down general rules for the
   legitimate uses we should keep within the limits which they prescribe.

   2. Let this be our principle, that we err not in the use of the gifts
   of Providence when we refer them to the end for which their author made
   and destined them, since he created them for our good, and not for our
   destruction. No man will keep the true path better than he who shall
   have this end carefully in view. Now then, if we consider for what end
   he created food, we shall find that he consulted not only for our
   necessity, but also for our enjoyment and delight. Thus, in clothing,
   the end was, in addition to necessity, comeliness and honour; and in
   herbs, fruits, and trees, besides their various uses, gracefulness of
   appearance and sweetness of smell. Were it not so, the Prophet would
   not enumerate among the mercies of God "wine that maketh glad the heart
   of man, and oil to make his face to shine," (Ps. civ. 15.) The
   Scriptures would not everywhere mention, in commendation of his
   benignity, that he had given such things to men. The natural qualities
   of things themselves demonstrate to what end, and how far, they may be
   lawfully enjoyed. Has the Lord adorned flowers with all the beauty
   which spontaneously presents itself to the eye, and the sweet odour
   which delights the sense of smell, and shall it be unlawful for us to
   enjoy that beauty and this odour? What? Has he not so distinguished
   colours as to make some more agreeable than others? Has he not given
   qualities to gold and silver, ivory and marble, thereby rendering them
   precious above other metals or stones? In short, has he not given many
   things a value without having any necessary use?

   3. Have done, then, with that inhuman philosophy which, in allowing no
   use of the creatures but for necessity, not only maliciously deprives
   us of the lawful fruit of the divine beneficence, but cannot be
   realised without depriving man of all his senses, and reducing him to a
   block. But, on the other hand, let us with no less care guard against
   the lusts of the flesh, which, if not kept in order, break through all
   bounds, and are, as I have said, advocated by those who, under pretence
   of liberty, allow themselves every sort of license. First one restraint
   is imposed when we hold that the object of creating all things was to
   teach us to know their author, and feel grateful for his indulgence.
   Where is the gratitude if you so gorge or stupify yourself with
   feasting and wine as to be unfit for offices of piety, or the duties of
   your calling? Where the recognition of God, if the flesh, boiling forth
   in lust through excessive indulgences infects the mind with its
   impurity, so as to lose the discernment of' honour and rectitude? Where
   thankfulness to God for clothing, if on account of sumptuous raiment we
   both admire ourselves and disdain others? if, from a love of show and
   splendour, we pave the way for immodesty? Where our recognition of God,
   if the glare of these things captivates our minds? For many are so
   devoted to luxury in all their senses that their mind lies buried: many
   are so delighted with marble, gold, and pictures, that they become
   marble-hearted--are changed as it were into metal, and made like
   painted figures. The kitchen, with its savoury smells, so engrosses
   them that they have no spiritual savour. The same thing may be seen in
   other matters. Wherefore, it is plain that there is here great
   necessity for curbing licentious abuse, and conforming to the rule of
   Paul, "make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof,"
   (Rom. xiii. 14.) Where too much liberty is given to them, they break
   forth without measure or restraint.

   4. There is no surer or quicker way of accomplishing this than by
   despising the present life and aspiring to celestial immortality. For
   hence two rules arise: First, "it remaineth, that both they that have
   wives be as though they had none;#8221; "and they that use this world,
   as not abusing it," (1 Cor. vii. 29, 31.) Secondly, we must learn to be
   no less placid and patient in enduring penury, than moderate in
   enjoying abundance. He who makes it his rule to use this world as if he
   used it not, not only cuts off all gluttony in regard to meat and
   drink, and all effeminacy, ambition, pride, excessive shows and
   austerity, in regard to his table, his house, and his clothes, but
   removes every care and affection which might withdraw or hinder him
   from aspiring to the heavenly life, and cultivating the interest of his
   soul. [16] It was well said by Cato: Luxury causes great care, and
   produces great carelessness as to virtue; and it is an old
   proverb,--Those who are much occupied with the care of the body,
   usually give little care to the soul. Therefore while the liberty of
   the Christian in external matters is not to be tied down to a strict
   rule, it is, however, subject to this law--he must indulge as little as
   possible; on the other hand, it must be his constant aims not only to
   curb luxury, but to cut off all show of superfluous abundance, and
   carefully beware of converting a help into an hinderance.

   5. Another rule is, that those in narrow and slender circumstances
   should learn to bear their wants patiently, that they may not become
   immoderately desirous of things, the moderate use of which implies no
   small progress in the school of Christ. For in addition to the many
   other vices which accompany a longing for earthly good, he who is
   impatient under poverty almost always betrays the contrary disease in
   abundance. By this I mean, that he who is ashamed of a sordid garment
   will be vain-glorious of a splendid one; he who not contented with a
   slender, feels annoyed at the want of a more luxurious supper, will
   intemperately abuse his luxury if he obtains it; he who has a
   difficulty, and is dissatisfied in submitting to a private and humble
   condition, will be unable to refrain from pride if he attain to honour.
   Let it be the aim of all who have any unfeigned desire for piety to
   learn, after the example of the Apostle, "both to be full and to be
   hungry, both to abound and to suffer need," (Philip. iv. 12.)
   Scripture, moreover, has a third rule for modifying the use of earthly
   blessings. We have already adverted to it when considering the offices
   of charity. For it declares that they have all been given us by the
   kindness of God, and appointed for our use under the condition of being
   regarded as trusts, of which we must one day give account. We must,
   therefore, administer them as if we constantly heard the words sounding
   in our ears, "Give an account of your stewardship." At the same time,
   let us remember by whom the account is to be taken, viz., by him who,
   while he so highly commends abstinence, sobriety, frugality, and
   moderation, abominates luxury, pride, ostentation, and vanity; who
   approves of no administration but that which is combined with charity,
   who with his own lips has already condemned all those pleasures which
   withdraw the heart from chastity and purity, or darken the intellect.

   6. The last thing to be observed is, that the Lord enjoins every one of
   us, in all the actions of life, to have respect to our own calling. He
   knows the boiling restlessness of the human mind, the fickleness with
   which it is borne hither and thither, its eagerness to hold opposites
   at one time in its grasp, its ambition. Therefore, lest all things
   should be thrown into confusion by our folly and rashness, he has
   assigned distinct duties to each in the different modes of life. And
   that no one may presume to overstep his proper limits, he has
   distinguished the different modes of life by the name of callings.
   Every man's mode of life, therefore, is a kind of station assigned him
   by the Lord, that he may not be always driven about at random. So
   necessary is this distinction, that all our actions are thereby
   estimated in his sight, and often in a very different way from that in
   which human reason or philosophy would estimate them. There is no more
   illustrious deed even among philosophers than to free one's country
   from tyranny, and yet the private individual who stabs the tyrant is
   openly condemned by the voice of the heavenly Judge. But I am unwilling
   to dwell on particular examples; it is enough to know that in every
   thing the call of the Lord is the foundation and beginning of right
   action. He who does not act with reference to it will never, in the
   discharge of duty, keep the right path. He will sometimes be able,
   perhaps, to give the semblance of something laudable, but whatever it
   may be in the sight of man, it will be rejected before the throne of
   God; and besides, there will be no harmony in the different parts of
   his life. Hence, he only who directs his life to this end will have it
   properly framed; because free from the impulse of rashness, he will not
   attempt more than his calling justifies, knowing that it is unlawful to
   overleap the prescribed bounds. He who is obscure will not decline to
   cultivate a private life, that he may not desert the post at which God
   has placed him. Again, in all our cares, toils, annoyances, and other
   burdens, it will be no small alleviation to know that all these are
   under the superintendence of God. The magistrate will more willingly
   perform his office, and the father of a family confine himself to his
   proper sphere. Every one in his particular mode of life will, without
   repining, suffer its inconveniences, cares, uneasiness, and anxiety,
   persuaded that God has laid on the burden. This, too, will afford
   admirable consolation, that in following your proper calling, no work
   will be so mean and sordid as not to have a splendour and value in the
   eye of God.
