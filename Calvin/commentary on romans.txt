   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   On no portion of The New Testament have so many Commentaries been
   written as on The Epistle To The Romans. We have indeed no separate
   Comment extant by any of the Fathers on this Epistle; though it has
   been explained, together with other parts of Scripture, by Origen in
   the third century; by Jerome, Chrysostom, and in part by Augustine, in
   the fourth; by Theodoret in the fifth; by OEcumenius in the tenth; and
   by Theophylact in the eleventh century. But since the Reformation, many
   separate Expositions have been published, beside a learned Introduction
   by Luther, and Notes or Scholia by Zuingle and Melancthon.

   The first complete Commentary, as it appears, was written by Bullinger;
   the second by Bucer, a Professor of Theology at Cambridge for a short
   time in the reign of Edward the Sixth; and the next in order of time
   was this Work by Calvin, composed at Strasbourg in the year 1539. The
   fourth was by Peter Martyr; and this was translated into English in the
   year 1568. Another was afterwards published by Rodolph Gualter,
   Minister at Zurich.

   Early in the next century the learned Pareus [1] delivered lectures on
   this Epistle, as Professor of Theology in the University of Heidelberg
   -- a work of great learning and of great merits though written in a
   style too scholastic to suit the taste of the present day. His special
   object was to rebut the arguments and expose the sophistries of Popish
   writers, particularly those of Bellarmine, the acutest, the subtlest
   and the most learned of all the Jesuits of his own age, and perhaps of
   any in after ages. There is hardly a subject in any measure connected
   with the contents of this Epistle which Pareus does not discuss: at the
   end of every chapter a number of questions are stated and answered,
   especially such as refer to the disputes between Papists and
   Protestants. He also controverts the perversions of Socinianism.

   The next work that requires particular notice is that of Turrettin, a
   Professor of Theology in the University of Geneva. It was published
   about the commencement of the last century; the author died in the year
   1737. The doctrine of Calvin had somewhat degenerated in his time,
   though the work on the whole takes the side of orthodoxy. It yet shows
   a leaning to those views, which commonly issue its sentiments
   subversive of the essentials of true Christianity.

   The first Commentary published in this country, composed in English,
   was by Elnathan Parr, B.D., Rector of Palgrave in Suffolk. He was, as
   it appears the personal friend of Sir Nathaniel Bacon, an elder brother
   of Lord Bacon. He dedicated his work to Sir Nathaniel, and speaks of
   him as having been a hearer of what he published when delivered from
   the pulpit. [2] His style is that of his age, and appear quaint now;
   but his thoughts are often very striking and truly excellent, and his
   sentiments are wholly in accordant with those of the Reformers.

   Since that time until this century, no work of any note has appeared
   separately on this Epistle. But within the last thirty years several
   Commentaries have been published. Besides those of Flatt and Tholuck in
   Germany, three at least have appeared in this country, and three in
   America. The authors in America are Moses Stuart, M.A., Professor of
   Sacred Literature at Andover in Massachusetts, the Rev Albert Barnes,
   and Charles Hodge, Professor of Biblical Literature at Princeton. Those
   in this country are the Rev F. Fry, Rector of Desford, Leicestershire,
   Robert Haldane Esq., and Dr Chalmers. The doctrine held by Calvin is
   essentially maintained in all these works, and in most of them in its
   fullest extent.

   Of our American brethren, the most learned and the most versed in
   criticisms is Professor Stuart; the fullest and the minutest expositor
   is the Rev. A. Barnes; and the acutest and the most concise commentator
   is Professor Hodge. The two first seem, in some instances, like
   Turrettin, to deviate somewhat from what may be considered strict
   orthodoxy, at least in their mode of explaining some subjects: the last
   is liable to no charge of this kind.

   Respecting our own countrymen, there is a more perfect unanimity,
   though they belonged to different Churches. The Lectures of the Rev. J.
   Fry are those of a strict Predestinarian, and yet replete with remarks,
   both experimental and practical. The layman, R. Haldane, Esq., has
   displayed very high qualifications as an expositor; he is strictly and
   even stiffly orthodox, and can brook no deviation from what he regards
   as the truth. Of Dr. Chalmers' Lectures, comprised in four volumes,
   12mo, it is difficult to pronounce an opinion. They are the productions
   of a philosopher's and one of the highest grade, who, at the same time,
   possessed the heart and the experience of an humble Christian. He
   expatiates over the whole field of truth with the eye of an eagle, and
   with the docility of a child, without ever overleaping the boundaries
   of revelation. He was evidently a man by himself, taller by his
   shoulders than most men, either in this or in any other age, having a
   mind as sound as it was vigorous, an imagination as sober as it was
   creative, and a capacity to illustrate and to amplify quite unequaled.

   All these works have their peculiar excellencies, adapted to different
   tastes and capacities, and no doubt they have their defects. The same
   must be said of Calvin's work. But as a concise and lucid commentator
   he certainly excels. He is not so much an expounder of words, as of
   principles. He carries on an unbroken chain of reasoning throughout, in
   a brief and clear manner. Having well considered the main drift of a
   passage, he sets before us what it contains, by a brief statement or by
   a clear process of reasoning; and often by a single sentence he throws
   light on a whole passage: and though his mind possessed more vigour of
   intellect and sound good sense, than what is called imagination; yet
   there are some fine thoughts occasionally occurring, beautifully
   expressed, to which that faculty must have given birth. There is also a
   noble grandeur and dignity in his sentiments, rarely to be found in
   other writers.

   Professor Stuart has justly characterized this Work by saying, that it
   contains "fundamental investigation of the logic and course of thought
   contained in the Epistle;" and that it embraces "very little verbal
   criticism. Many a difficulty is solved without any appearance of
   effort, or any show of learning. Calvin," he adds, "is by far the most
   distinguished of all the Commentators of his times."

   It was mainly to supply the defect named above, the want of verbal
   criticism, that Notes have been added in the present Edition. They are
   also designed to furnish the reader with such expositions as have been
   suggested by posterior critics and commentators. And as we are
   generally desirous of knowing the names of authors, they have been for
   the most part given. Much light is thrown on a passage by conveying the
   full meaning of the original. This has been done partly by giving such
   different versions as seemed most entitled to approbation, and partly
   by referring to other passages where such words occur: so that a common
   reader, unacquainted with the original, may, to a certain extent, have
   the advantage of one well versed in the Greek language.

   Variety of meanings given to words, and also to passages, has been
   deemed by some to lessen the certainty of truth, but without any solid
   reason; for this variety as found in the works of all sound and
   judicious critics, seldom or ever affects any thing important, either
   in doctrine, experience, or practice, and tends often to expand the
   meaning and to render it clearer and more prominent. There has been
   indeed sometimes a pruriency in this respect, an unholy ambition for
   novelty, a desire for new discoveries, an indulgence of mere curiosity,
   which have been very injurious. Much of this sort of mania prevailed
   among some of the German divines in the last century, as Wolfius
   clearly shows in his works, in which he notices and disproves many
   vagaries assuming the name of critical expositions; and much of a
   similar kind of spirit seems to prevail still in that country. It is a
   mania for criticism, for its own sake, without any concern or
   solicitude for the truth: and ingenious criticism has often been
   resorted to by the oppugners of vital Christianity as means for
   supporting heterodoxical sentiments. But there is a palpable difference
   between men of this character, the mere gladiators of criticism, and
   those who embrace the truth, and whose object it is faithfully to
   explain it in consistency with the general tenor of what is revealed,
   and who have what is indispensably necessary for such a work, a
   spiritual experience, which often affords better assistance than any
   critical acumen that can ever be possessed. The man who has seen a
   thing has a much better idea of it than the man who has only heard it
   described.

   Attempts have been made by various authors to show and prove, that the
   Style Of The Epistles, especially those of Paul, is consonant with that
   of classical writers. Blackwall laboured much to do this in this
   country, as well as many German divines, particularly in the last
   century. In common with some of the Fathers, they thought to recommend
   in this way the Apostolic Writings to the attention of literary men.
   But it was a labour not wisely undertaken, as it must have necessarily
   proved abortive: for though some phrases may be classical, yet the
   general style is what might have been naturally expected from the
   writers, brought up, as they had all been, in the Jewish religion, and
   accustomed, as they had been, to the writings of the Old Testament.
   Hence their style throughout is Hebraistic; and the meaning of many of
   the Greek words which they use is not to be sought from the Classics,
   but from the Greek Translation of the ancient Scriptures, and sometimes
   from the Hebrew itself, of which that is a translation. [3]

   Much evil and no good must result from a claim that cannot be
   supported: nor is it at all necessary to make such a claim. It has been
   long ago repudiated, and repudiated by Paul himself. Writers have often
   ascribed to Paul what he himself distinctly and entirely disclaimed,
   and never attempted to attain or to practice, and that on principle,
   "Lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect." It was not by
   "excellency of speech" that he courted the attention of the classical
   and refined Grecians, that he recommended the gospel to them; it was
   not by the tinsel of mere eloquence that he succeeded in his preaching,
   nor by the elegance and beauty of his diction; but by something much
   higher, much greater, much more powerful and efficient. We ought to
   follow his example, and stand on his high ground, and not to descend to
   that which is no better than a quagmire. It is a happy thing, and no
   doubt so designed by God, that the shell should not be made of fine
   materials, lest men's minds should be attracted by it and neglect the
   kernel. God might, if he chose, have easily endued his Apostles with
   eloquence more than human, and enabled them to write with elegance more
   than Grecian; but He did not do so, and Paul expressly gives us the
   reason, "that our faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
   the power of God."

   It is generally agreed, that the Epistle To The Romans was written at
   Corinth, and about the end of the year 57, or at the beginning of the
   year 58, and that it is the fifth Epistle in order of time; the two
   Epistles to the Thessalonians, the Epistle to the Galatians, and the
   first to the Corinthians, having been previously written. Then followed
   the second Epistle to the Corinthians, the Epistles to the Ephesians,
   Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, and the Hebrews, the first to
   Timothy, the Epistle to Titus, and the second to Timothy

   The common date assigned to Paul's conversion is AD 35. He wrote his
   first Epistle, that is, the first to the Thessalonians, in 52,
   seventeen years after his conversion. His second Epistle to Timothy,
   his last, was written from Rome in 65. So that he wrote his fourteen
   Epistles during these thirteen years. The whole extent of his ministry
   seems to have been about thirty years; for it is not supposed that he
   long outlived the date of his second Epistle to Timothy. Tradition
   says, that he was beheaded at Rome, June 29; AD 66.

   Paul's first coming to Rome was in the spring of the year 61. He
   continued there as a prisoner for two years. [4] When he was released,
   most writers are of the opinion, that he returned early in 63 to Judea,
   in company with Timothy, and left Titus at Crete; that he visited the
   Churches in Asia Minor, then the Churches in Macedonia; that he
   wintered at Nicopolis, a city of Epirus, in 64; that afterwards he
   proceeded to Crete and also to Corinth; and that early in 65 he again
   visited Rome, was taken prisoner, and beheaded in the following year.
   [5] This account clearly shows that he did not accomplish his purpose
   of visiting Spain, as tradition has recorded.

   The first introduction of the Gospel into Rome is involved in
   uncertainty. The probability is, that some of the "strangers of Rome,"
   present at the day of Pentecost, were converted, and at their return
   promoted the spread of the Gospel. Paul mentions two, "Andronicus and
   Junia," as having professed the faith before him, and as having been
   noted among the Apostles. He makes mention, too, of another eminent
   Christian, "Rufus" whose father, as it is supposed carried our Savior's
   cross, Mark 15:21. It is not improbable, that these were afterwards
   assisted by such as had been converted under the ministry of Paul; for
   he speaks of some of those whom he salutes at Rome as being "beloved,"
   and as having been his "fellow-workers."

   What some of the Fathers have related was in the first instance a
   tradition, as there was nothing recorded on the subject before the
   latter part of the second century, except what has been ascribed to
   Dionysius of Corinth, preserved by Eusebius. Irenoeus and Tertullian
   were the first retailers of the tradition, that Peter, in conjunction
   with Paul, was the founder of the Church at Rome. This tradition
   increased considerably by the time of Jerome, who, in the fourth
   century, says, that Peter had been bishop of Rome for twenty-five
   years! But this account is so clearly inconsistent with what we learn
   from the Acts of the Apostles respecting Peter, that some of the most
   reasonable of the Papists themselves have given it up as unworthy of
   credit. [6]

   It appears next to a certainty that Peter was not at Rome when Paul
   wrote his Epistle in 57 or 58, for he sends no salutation to Peter: --
   And also that he had not been there previous to that time; for it is
   wholly unreasonable to suppose, that, had he been there, Paul would
   have made no reference to his labours. It further amounts almost to a
   certainty, that Peter was not at Rome when Paul was for two years a
   prisoner there, from 61 to 63; for he makes no mention of him in any
   way, not even in the four or five Epistles which he wrote during that
   time: And that Peter was not at Rome during Paul's last imprisonment in
   65 and 66, is evident from the second Epistle to Timothy; for he makes
   no mention of Peter, and what he says of Christians there, that they
   "all forsook him," would have been highly discreditable to Peter, if he
   was there. So that we have the strongest reasons to conclude, that
   Peter had no part in forming and establishing a Church in Rome during
   Paul's life, whatever share in the work he might have had afterwards.
   [7] But the first tradition, or the first account, given by Irenoeus
   and Tertullian, refers only to a co-operation: and yet this
   co-operation is wholly inconsistent with what has been stated, the
   force of which no reasonable man can resist.

   The learned Pareus proceeds in a different way to prove that Peter was
   never at Rome. He shows from different parts of the Acts of the
   Apostles and the Epistle to the Galatians, that Peter was in Judea at
   the time when tradition declares that he was at Rome. Peter was in
   Judea when Paul was converted, Acts 9; and three years after this --
   that is, in the year 38, Galatians 1:8. He was in Judea in the year 45,
   when he was imprisoned by Herod, Acts 12, and in 49, fourteen years
   after Paul's conversion, Acts 15, Galatians 2:1-9. Had he been to Rome
   during this time, some account of such a journey must surely have been
   given. After this time we find that he was at Antioch, Galatians 2:11.
   If it be asked, where did he afterwards exercise his ministry? Where
   more likely than among the Jews, as he had hitherto most clearly done;
   for he was the Apostle of the Circumcision, and among those to whom he
   sent his Epistles. The dating of the first at "Babylon," has led some
   to conjecture that it was a figurative term for Rome; but why not for
   Jerusalem, or for Antioch? for Christians were at that time treated
   everywhere like captives or aliens, and especially in the land of
   Judea.

   What then are we to say as to this tradition? The same, according to
   the just remark of Pareus, as what we must say of many other traditions
   of that age, that it is nothing but a fable, which, like many others,
   would have passed away, had it not been allied to a growing
   superstition. With respect to what Eusebius says of the testimony of a
   presbyter, named Caius, that about the beginning of the third century
   he saw the graves of Peter and Paul at Rome, it may be easily accounted
   for: it was the age of pious fraud, when the relics of saints could be
   found almost everywhere; and, in the next century, the wood and the
   nails of the Cross were discovered! Those who can believe these things,
   may have a credulity large enough to swallow up the testimony of Caius.
   [8]

   The most probable account, then, of the commencement of a Christian
   Church at Rome, is what has been already stated. The condition of that
   Church, when Paul wrote to it, we may in a great measure learn from the
   Epistle itself. It had a high character, viewed in a general way; but
   there were some defects and blemishes. Its faith had been widely
   reported: there were at the same time some contentions and divisions
   among its members, arising especially from the prejudices of the Jewish
   believers. To remove the causes of this dissension, was evidently one
   of the main objects of Paul in this Epistle.

   The Order And Arrangement Of The Epistle have been somewhat differently
   viewed by different authors. Pareus includes the whole in this brief
   summary -- "The Jews and Gentiles are equally guilty; they are equally
   justified freely by faith in Christ, without works; they are equally
   bound to lead a holy life, to be humble, and to love one another."
   Stuart says, that the whole of what the Epistle contains may be
   expressed in a single brief sentence -- "Christ our justification and
   sanctification."

   In giving a more specific view of the contents of this Epistle, the
   former author divides it into two parts -- doctrinal, 1-11.; and
   hortative, 12-16.: but the latter divides it into three parts --
   doctrinal, 1-8.; answers to objections, 9-11.; and hortatory, 12-16.
   The analysis of Professor Hodge, who takes the same view with Professor
   Stuart is the following: --

   "The Epistle consists of three parts. The first, which includes the
   first eight chapters, is occupied in the discussion of The Doctrine of
   Justification and its consequences. The second, embracing chapters 9,
   10, 11, treats of The Calling of the Gentiles, The Rejection and Future
   Conversion of the Jews. The third consists of Practical Exhortations
   and Salutations to the Christians at Rome."

   A more particular Analysis may be thus given: --

   I. Address - A desire to visit Rome - a brief View of The Gospel;
   1:1-18.

   II. Justification,

   1. A proof of its necessity -- the sin and guilt of both Gentiles and
   Jews, 1:18-3:21

   2. Its Nature and Character -- Examples, Abraham and David, 3:21-4

   3. Its Effects or Fruits -- Peace and Fullness of Grace, 5.; Death unto
   Sin and Eternal Life, 6.; Immunity from The Law and The Reigning Power
   of Sin, 7. Holiness, The Spirit's help, Patience in Afflictions,
   Perseverance, 8.

   III. God's Dealings Vindicated --

   l. Election and Reprobation, 9

   2. Unbelief and Faith, 10

   3. The Rejection of the Jews, The Adoption of the Gentiles, The
   Restoration of the Jews, 11

   IV Christian Duties

   1. Devotedness to God, Proper Use of Gifts, Love, Doing Good, 12.

   2. Obedience to Authority, Love to all, Purity, 13.

   3. Forbearance towards Weak Brethren, 14.

   4. Help to the Weak, Unanimity, Christ the Savior of Jews and Gentiles,
   15:1-13.

   V. Conclusion, --

   1. Paul's Labours and Purpose to Visit Rome, 15:13

   2. Salutations, Avoiding Disturbers, Promise of Victory, Praise to God,

   We have set before us in this Epistle especially two things, which it
   behoves us all rightly to understand -- the righteousness of man and
   the righteousness of God -- merit and grace, or salvation by works and
   salvation by faith. The light in which they are exhibited here is
   clearer and brighter than what we find in any other portion of
   Scripture, with the exception, perhaps, of the Epistle to the
   Galatians. Hence the great value which has in every age been attached
   to this Epistle by all really enlightened Christians; and hence also
   the strenuous efforts which have often been made to darken and wrest
   its meaning by men, though acute and learned, yet destitute of
   spiritual light. But let not the simple Christian conclude from the
   contrariety that is often found in the expositions on these two points,
   that there is no certainty in what is taught respecting them. There are
   no contrary views given of them by spiritually-minded men. Though on
   other subjects discussed here, such men have had their differences, yet
   on these they have ever been found unanimous: that salvation is from
   first to last by grace, and not by works, has ever been the conviction
   of really enlightened men in every age, however their opinion may have
   varied in other respects.

   It may seem very strange, when we consider the plain and decisive
   language, especially of this Epistle, and the clear and conclusive
   reasoning which it exhibits, that any attempt should ever be made by a
   reasonable being, acknowledging the authority of Scripture, to pervert
   what it plainly teaches, and to evade what it clearly proves. But a
   right view of what human nature is, when unrenewed, as exhibited in
   God's Word, and as proved by history and made evident by observation,
   enables us fully to account for what would otherwise remain an enigma.
   No truth is more fully confirmed by facts (and it ought ever to be
   remembered) than that "the natural man receiveth not the things of the
   Spirit of God," and that he "cannot know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned." This declaration clearly accounts for the fact,
   that men of great learning have often misunderstood many things in
   Scripture, and such things as are plain enough even to the unlettered
   when spiritually enlightened. The learned Scribes and Rabbins were
   blind leaders of the blind, when even babes understood the mysteries of
   the kingdom of God: and no better than the Scribes are many learned
   men, professing Christianity, in our day.

   There is indeed a special reason why, on these points, unenlightened
   men should contrive means to evade the obvious meaning of Scripture;
   for they are such things as come in constant contact with a principle,
   the strongest that belongs to human nature in its fallen state. Other
   doctrines may be held as speculations, and kept, as it were, at a
   distance; but when we come to merit and grace, to work and faith, man's
   pride is touched; and as long as he is under its prevailing influence,
   he will be certain, in some way or another, direct or evasive, to
   support merit in opposition to grace, or works in opposition to faith.
   When the authority of tradition supplanted the authority of Scripture,
   the doctrine of merit so prevailed, that the preposterous idea, that
   merits were a salable and a transferable commodity, gained ground in
   the world. A notion of this kind is too gross and absurd to be
   entertained by any who acknowledge God's Word as the only umpire in
   religion; and yet what is not essentially different has often been
   maintained; for to say that salvation is partly by faith and partly by
   works, is really the same thing, inasmuch as the principle of merit is
   thereby admitted. Man naturally cleaves to his own righteousness; all
   those who are ignorant are self-righteous, and all the learned who
   understand not the gospel; and it is wonderful what ingenious evasions
   and learned subtleties men will have recourse to in order to resist the
   plain testimony of Scripture. When they cannot maintain their ground as
   advocates of salvation alone by merits, they will attempt to maintain
   it as advocates of a system, which allows a part to grace and a part to
   works -- an amalgamation which Paul expressly repudiates, Romans 11:6.

   But it is remarkable how the innate disposition of man has displayed
   itself in this respect. Conscious, as it were, in some measure of moral
   imperfections, he has been striving for the most part to merit his
   salvation by ceremonial works. This has been the case in all ages with
   heathens: their sacrifices, austerities, and mechanical devotions were
   their merits; they were the works by which they expected to obtain
   happiness. God favored the people of Israel with the rituals of
   religion, which were designed merely as aids and means to attain and
   preserve true religion; but they converted them to another purpose,
   and, like the heathens, regarded them as meritorious performances, and
   expected God's acceptance for the very religious acts which they
   exercised: and in order to make up, as it were, a sufficient quantity
   of merit, they made additions to those services which God had
   appointed, as though to multiply acts of this kind was to render their
   salvation more certain. The very same evil crept early into the
   Christian Church, and still continues to exist. The accumulation of
   ceremonies is of itself a sufficient proof, that salvation by faith was
   in a great measure lost sight of: we want no other evidence; it is what
   has been ever done whenever the light of truth has become dim and
   obscure. We see the same evil in the present day. Outward privileges
   and outward acts of worship are in effect too often substituted for
   that grace which changes the heart, and for that living faith which
   unites us to the Savior, which works by love and overcomes the world.
   The very disposition to over-value external privileges and the mere
   performances of religious duties, is an unequivocal evidence, that
   salvation by faith is not understood, or very imperfectly understood,
   and not really embraced.

   The only remedy, as means for this evil, is that which we find employed
   by Paul in this Epistle. He begins by showing what every man, Jew and
   Gentile, is by nature; he proves by the clearest evidence, that all
   have sinned and become guilty before God. And having done this, he
   discloses the way of salvation which God himself has planned and
   revealed; and he teaches us, that it is altogether by grace and through
   faith that we can be saved, and not by works. In order cordially to
   embrace this latter truth, it is necessary to know the first, that we
   are sinners under condemnation. It is impossible, according to the very
   constitution of man's mind, that he should really and truly accede to
   the one, without a real and deep knowledge of the other. The whole need
   not a physician, but the sick. It is only he who is really convinced of
   sin and who feels its guilt and its burden intolerable, that ever will,
   or indeed ever can, really lay hold on that free salvation which God
   has provided. And when this free salvation is really known, all other
   things compared with it will be deemed as nothing; and then all outward
   privileges will be viewed only as means, and all outward acts of
   religion only as aids and helps; and then also all our works, however
   great and self-denying, will be regarded in no way meritorious, but
   imperfect and defective, and acceptable only through the merits of our
   High Priest at God's right hand.

   It has not been deemed necessary to give in this Edition any specimens
   of title-pages, etc., from former Editions, either In Latin or in
   English; as they are to be found in the Old Translation already in the
   hands of the subscribers.

   edition and was published in 1633.

   [3] "The writers of the New Testament, or rather (with reverence be it
   Spoken!) the Holy Spirit, whose penmen they were, wisely chose, in
   expressing evangelical notions, to employ such Greek terms as had been
   long before used for the same purposes by the Greek Translators of the
   New Testament: and thus the Septuagint version, however imperfect and
   faulty in many particulars, became in this respect, not to the first
   age of the Church only, but also to all succeeding generations, the
   connecting link between the languages of the Old and New Testament, and
   will be regarded in this view as long as sound judgment and real
   learning shall continue among men." --ParkHurst.

   [4] It was while a prisoner at this time at Rome that he wrote his
   Epistles to the Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, and the
   Hebrews also, as it is generally supposed.

   [5] See Horne's Introduction, volume 4 part 2 chapter; 3 section 1.

   [6] The inconsistencies of what the retailers of this tradition say,
   are quite palpable. Irenoeus affirms, that "the Church at Rome was
   founded and constituted (fundata et constituta) by the two Apostles,
   Peter and Paul." Epiphanius says, that they were the first "Bishops" at
   Rome, as well as Apostles, while Irenoeus declares, that they both
   "delivered the episcopal office into the hands of Linus;" and it is
   said in what are called the Apostolic Constitutions, that "Linus was
   ordained bishop by Paul, and Clement after the death of Linus by
   Peter." -- see Dr. Barrow on the Pope's Supremacy, pages 127-129.

   [7] But this cannot be admitted, as the same informant, Tradition,
   tells us, that Peter and Paul suffered martyrdom at the same time. The
   only thing which Peter appears to have had to do in forming and
   founding a church at Rome, was to have been the instrument in the
   conversion, at the day of Pentecost, of those who in all probability
   were the first who introduced the gospel into Rome: and it is probable
   that it was this circumstance which occasioned the tradition, that he
   had been the founder of that church. Less occasion has often produced
   tales of this kind.

   [8] Let it not be supposed, that by discrediting some things, we
   discredit every thing said by the Fathers. They ought to be treated as
   all other historians. What we find on examination to be unfounded,
   ought to be so viewed: and what we have every reason to believe to be
   true, ought to be so received. Even such a man as Dr. Lardner seemed
   unwilling to reject this tale, from fear of lessening the credit of
   history; evidently mistaking the ground on which history has a title to
   credit. The many authorities adduced respecting Peter being at Rome may
   be reduced almost to two -- Irenoeus and Tertullian. They were the
   first to stamp as it were a kind of authority on this report, and also
   on others to which no credit is given even by those who would have the
   Fathers to have been almost infallible. The learned Dr. Copleston, the
   present Bishop of Landaff, in his pamphlet on the Errors of Romanism,
   justly says, "It is even a matter of serious doubt whether St. Peter
   was ever at Rome. There is no good historical evidence of the fact; and
   there is much probability against it." --P. 87.

   JOHN CALVIN TO SIMON GRYN�����US, [9]


   I Remember that when three years ago we had a friendly converse as to
   the best mode of expounding Scripture, the plan which especially
   pleased you, seemed also to me the most entitled to approbation: we
   both thought that the chief excellency of an expounder consists in
   lucid brevity. And, indeed, since it is almost his only work to lay
   open the mind of the writer whom he undertakes to explain, the degree
   in which he leads away his readers from it, in that degree he goes
   astray from his purpose, and in a manner wanders from his own
   boundaries. Hence we expressed a hope, that from the number of those
   who strive at this day to advance the interest of theology by this kind
   of labour, some one would be found, who would study plainness, and
   endeavour to avoid the evil of tiring his readers with prolixity. I
   know at the same time that this view is not taken by all, and that
   those who judge otherwise have their reasons; but still I cannot be
   drawn away from the love of what is compendious. But as there is such a
   variety, found in the minds of men, that different things please
   different persons, let every one in this case follow his own judgment,
   provided that no one attempts to force others to adopt his own rules.
   Thus it will be, that we who approve of brevity, will not reject nor
   despise the labours of those who are more copious and diffused in their
   explanations of Scripture, and that they also in their turn will bear
   with us, though they may think us too compressed and concise.

   I indeed could not have restrained myself from attempting something to
   benefit the Church of God in this way. I am, however, by no means
   confident that I have attained what at that time seemed best to us; nor
   did I hope to attain it when I began; but I have endeavoured so to
   regulate my style, that I might appear to aim at that model. How far I
   have succeeded, as it is not my part to determine, I leave to be
   decided by you and by such as you are.

   That I have dared to make the trial, especially on this Epistle of
   Paul, I indeed see, will subject me to the condemnation of many: for
   since men of so much learning have already laboured in the explanation
   of it, it seems not probable that there is any room for others to
   produce any thing better. And I confess, that though I promised to
   myself some fruit from my labour, I was at first deterred by this
   thought; for I feared, lest I should incur the imputation of
   presumption by applying my hand to a work which had been executed by so
   many illustrious workmen. There are extant on this Epistle many
   Commentaries by the ancients, and many by modern writers: and truly
   they could have never employed their labours in a better way; for when
   any one understands this Epistle, he has a passage opened to him to the
   understanding of the whole Scripture.

   Of the ancients who have, by their piety, learning, holiness, and also
   by their age, gained so much authority, that we ought to despise
   nothing of what they have adduced, I will say nothing; and with regard
   to those who live at this day, it is of no benefit to mention them all
   by name: Of those who have spent most labour in this work, I will
   express my opinion.

   Philip Melancthon, who, by his singular learning and industry, and by
   that readiness in all kinds of knowledge, in which he excels, has
   introduced more light than those who had preceded him. But as it seems
   to have been his object to examine only those things which are mainly
   worthy of attention, he dwelt at large on these, and designedly passed
   by many things which common minds find to be difficult. Then follows
   Bullinger, who has justly attained no small praise; for with learning
   he has connected plainness, for which he has been highly commended. In
   the last place comes Bucer, who, by publishing his works, has given as
   it were the finishing stroke. For in addition to his recondite learning
   and enlarged knowledge of things, and to the clearness of his mind, and
   much reading and many other excellencies, in which he is hardly
   surpassed by any at this day, equaled by few and excelled by still
   fewer -- he possesses, as you know, this praise as his own -- that no
   one in our age has been with so much labour engaged in the work of
   expounding Scripture. [10]

   As then it would have been, I know, a proof of the most presumptuous
   rivalry, to wish to contend with such men, such a thing never entered
   my mind; nor have I a desire to take from them the least portion of
   their praise. Let that favor and authority, which according to the
   confession of all good men they have deserved, be continued to them.
   This, however, I trust, will be allowed -- that nothing has been done
   by men so absolutely perfect, that there is no room left for the
   industry of those who succeed them, either to polish, or to adorn, or
   to illustrate. Of myself I venture not to say any thing, except that I
   thought that my labour would not be useless, and that I have undertaken
   it for no other reason than to promote the public good of the Church.

   I farther hoped, that by adopting a different plan, I should not expose
   myself to the invidious charge of rivalry, of which I was afraid in the
   first instance. Philipp attained his object by illustrating the
   principal points: being occupied with these primary things, he passed
   by many things which deserve attention; and it was not his purpose to
   prevent others to examine them. Bucer is too diffuse for men in
   business to read, and too profound to be understood by such as are
   simple and not capable of much application: for whatever be the subject
   which he handles, so many things are suggested to him through the
   incredible fecundity of his mind, in which he excels, that he knows not
   when to stop. Since then the first has not explained every passage, and
   the other has handled every point more at large than it can be read in
   a short time, my design has not even the appearance of being an act of
   rivalship. I, however, hesitated for some time, whether it would be
   better to gather some gleanings after these and others, by which I
   might assist humbler minds -- or to compose a regular comment, in which
   I should necessarily have to repeat many things which have been
   previously said by them all, or at least by some of them. But as they
   often vary from one another, and thus present a difficulty to simple
   readers, who hesitate as to what opinion they ought to receive, I
   thought that it would be no vain labour, if by pointing out the best
   explanation, I relieved them from the trouble of forming a judgment,
   who are not able to form a judgment for themselves; and especially as I
   determined to treat things so briefly, that without much loss of time,
   readers may peruse in my work what is contained in other writings. In
   short, I have endeavoured that no one may justly complain, that there
   are here many things which are superfluous.

   Of the usefulness of this work I will say nothing; men not malignant,
   will, however, it may be, have reasons to confess, that they have
   derived from it more benefit than I can with any modesty dare to
   promise. Now, that I some times dissent from others, or somewhat differ
   from them, it is but right that I should be excused. Such veneration we
   ought indeed to entertain for the Word of God, that we ought not to
   pervert it in the least degree by varying expositions; for its majesty
   is diminished, I know not how much, especially when not expounded with
   great discretion and with great sobriety. And if it be deemed a great
   wickedness to contaminate any thing that is dedicated to God, he surely
   cannot be endured, who, with impure, or even with unprepared hands,
   will handle that very thing, which of all things is the most sacred on
   earth. It is therefore an audacity, closely allied to a sacrilege,
   rashly to turn Scripture in any way we please, and to indulge our
   fancies as in sport; which has been done-by many in former times.

   But we ever find, that even those who have not been deficient in their
   zeal for piety, nor in reverence and sobriety in handling the mysteries
   of God, have by no means agreed among themselves on every point; for
   God hath never favored his servants with so great a benefit, that they
   were all endued with a full and perfect knowledge in every thing; and,
   no doubt, for this end -- that he might first keep them humble; and
   secondly, render them disposed to cultivate brotherly intercourse.
   Since then what would otherwise be very desirable cannot be expected in
   this life, that is, universal consent among us in the interpretation of
   all parts of Scripture, we must endeavour, that, when we depart from
   the sentiments of our predecessors, we may not be stimulated by any
   humour for novelty, nor impelled by any lust or defaming others, nor
   instigated by hatred, nor tickled by any ambition, but constrained by
   necessity alone, and by the motive of seeking to do good: and then,
   when this is done in interpreting Scripture, less liberty will be taken
   in the principles of religion, in which God would have the minds of his
   people to be especially unanimous. Readers will easily perceive that I
   had both these things in view.

   But as it becomes not me to decide or to pronounce any thing respecting
   myself, I willingly allow you this office; to whose judgment, since
   almost all in most things defer, I ought in everything to defer,
   inasmuch as you are intimately known to me by familiar intercourse;
   which is wont somewhat to diminish the esteem had for others, but does
   not a little increase yours, as is well known among all the learned.
   Farewell.

   Strasburgh, 18th October 1539.

   [9] The account given of Gryn����us by Watkins in his Biographical
   Dictionary, taken from Moreri, is the following: -- "A learned German,
   born at Veringen, in Hohenzollern, in 1493. He studied at Vienna, after
   which he became Rector of the school at Baden, but was thrown into
   prison for espousing the Lutheran doctrines. However, he recovered his
   liberty, and went to Heidelberg, afterwards to Basil, and, in 1531, he
   visited England. 1536 he returned to Basil, and died there in 1540." It
   is somewhat singular, that in the same year, 1540, another learned man
   of the same name, John James Gryn����us, was born at Berne, and was
   educated at Basil, and became distinguished for his learning -- Ed.

   [10] There were at least two other Reformers who had written on the
   Epistle to the Romans: but whether they were published at this time the
   writer is not able to say. There is by Luther an Introduction to it,
   which has been much praised, and has attained the name of the golden
   preface. Peter Martyr wrote a large comment on this Epistle, which was
   translated into English early in Queen Elizabeth's reign, in the year
   1568. It is rather remarkable that there was no commenter among our
   English Reformers, while on the Continent there were a great many
   commentators. -- Ed.

   EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS.


   With regard to the excellency of this Epistle, I know not whether it
   would be well for me to dwell long on the subject; for I fear, lest
   through my recommendations falling far short of what they ought to be,
   I should do nothing but obscure its merits: besides, the Epistle
   itself, at its very beginning, explains itself in a much better way
   than can be done by any words which I can use. It will then be better
   for me to pass on to the Argument, or the contents of the Epistle; and
   it will hence appear beyond all controversy, that besides other
   excellencies, and those remarkable, this can with truth be said of it,
   and it is what can never be sufficiently appreciated -- that when any
   one gains a knowledge of this Epistle, he has an entrance opened to him
   to all the most hidden treasures of Scripture.

   The whole Epistle is so methodical, that even its very beginning is
   framed according to the rules of art. As contrivance appears in many
   parts, which shall be noticed as we proceed, so also especially in the
   way in which the main argument is deduced: for having begun with the
   proof of his Apostleship, he then comes to the Gospel with the view of
   recommending it; and as this necessarily draws with it the subject of
   faith, he glides into that, being led by the chain of words as by the
   hand: and thus he enters on the main subject of the whole Epistle
   justification by faith; in treating which he is engaged to the end of
   the fifth chapter.

   The subject then of these chapters may be stated thus, -- man's only
   righteousness is through the mercy of God in Christ, which being
   offered by the Gospel is apprehended by faith.

   But as men are asleep in their sins, and flatter and delude themselves
   with a false notion about righteousness, so that they think not that
   they need the righteousness of faith, except they be cast down from all
   self-confidence, -- and further, as they are inebriated with the
   sweetness of lusts, and sunk in deep self-security, so that they are
   not-easily roused to seek righteousness, except they are struck down by
   the terror of divine judgment, -- the Apostle proceeds to do two things
   -- to convince men of iniquity, and to shake off the torpor of those
   whom he proves guilty.

   He first condemns all mankind from the beginning of the world for
   ingratitude, because they recognized not the workman in his
   extraordinary work: nay, when they were constrained to acknowledge him,
   they did not duly honor his majesty, but in their vanity profaned and
   dishonored it. Thus all became guilty of impiety, a wickedness more
   detestable than any thing else. And that he might more clearly show
   that all had departed from the Lord, he recounts the filthy and
   horrible crimes of which men everywhere became guilty: and this is a
   manifest proof, that they had degenerated from God, since these sins
   are evidences of divine wrath, which appear not except in the ungodly.
   And as the Jews and some of the Gentiles, while they covered their
   inward depravity by the veil of outward holiness, seemed to be in no
   way chargeable with such crimes, and hence thought themselves exempt
   from the common sentence of condemnation, the Apostle directs his
   discourse against this fictitious holiness; and as this mask before men
   cannot be taken away from saintlings, (sanctulis -- petty saints,) he
   summons them to the tribunal of God, whose eyes no latent evils can
   escape. Having afterwards divided his subject, he places apart both the
   Jews and the Gentiles before the tribunal of God. He cuts off from the
   Gentiles the excuse which they pleaded from ignorance, because
   conscience was to them a law, and by this they were abundantly
   convicted as guilty. He chiefly urges on the Jews that from which they
   took their defense, even the written law; and as they were proved to
   have transgressed it, they could not free themselves from the charge of
   iniquity, and a sentence against them had already been pronounced by
   the mouth of God himself. He at the same time obviates any objection
   which might have been made by them -- that the covenant of God, which
   was the symbol of holiness, would have been violated, if they were not
   to be distinguished from others. Here he first shows, that they
   excelled not others by the right of the covenant, for they had by their
   unfaithfulness departed from it: and then, that he might not derogate
   from the perpetuity of the divine promise, he concedes to them some
   privilege as arising from the covenant; but it proceeded from the mercy
   of God, and not from their merits. So that with regard to their own
   qualifications they were on a level with the Gentiles. He then proves
   by the authority of Scripture, that both Jews and Gentiles were all
   sinners; and he also slightly refers to the use of the law.

   Having wholly deprived all mankind of their confidence in their own
   virtue and of their boast of righteousness, and laid them prostrate by
   the severity of God's judgment, he returns to what he had before laid
   down as his subject -- that we are justified by faith; and he explains
   what faith is, and how the righteousness of Christ is by it attained by
   us. To these things he adds at the end of the third chapter a
   remarkable conclusion, with the view of beating down the fierceness of
   human pride, that it might not dare to raise up itself against the
   grace of God: and lest the Jews should confine so great a favor of God
   to their own nation, he also by the way claims it in behalf of the
   Gentiles.

   In the fourth chapter he reasons from example; which he adduces as
   being evident, and hence not liable to be cavilled at; and it is that
   of Abraham, who, being the father of the faithful ought to be deemed a
   pattern and a kind of universal example. Having then proved that he was
   justified by faith, the Apostle teaches us that we ought to maintain no
   other way of justification. And here he shows, that it follows from the
   rule of contraries, that the righteousness of works ceases to exist,
   since the righteousness of faith is introduced. And he confirms this by
   the declaration of David, who, by making the blessedness of man to
   depend on the mercy of God, takes it away from works, as they are
   incapable of making a man blessed. He then treats more fully what he
   had before shortly referred to -- that the Jews had no reason to raise
   themselves above the Gentiles, as this felicity is equally common to
   them both, since Scripture declares that Abraham obtained this
   righteousness in an uncircumcised state: and here he takes the
   opportunity of adding some remarks on the use of circumcision. He
   afterwards subjoins, that the promise of salvation depends on God's
   goodness alone: for were it to depend on the law, it could not bring
   peace to consciences, which it ought to confirm, nor could it attain
   its own fulfillment. Hence, that it may be sure and certain, we must,
   in embracing it, regard the truth of God alone, and not ourselves, and
   follow the example of Abraham, who, turning away from himself, had
   regard only to the power of God. At the end of the chapter, in order to
   make a more general application of the adduced example, he introduces
   several comparisons.

   In the fifth chapter, after having touched on the fruit and effects of
   the righteousness of faith, he is almost wholly taken up with
   illustrations, in order to make the point clearer. For, deducing an
   argument from one greater, he shows how much we, who have been redeemed
   and reconciled to God, ought to expect from his love; which was so
   abundantly poured forth towards us, when we were sinners and lost, that
   he gave for us his only-begotten and beloved Son. He afterwards makes
   comparisons between sin and free righteousness, between Christ and
   Adam, between death and life, between the law and grace: it hence
   appears that our evils, however vast they are, are swallowed up by the
   infinite mercy of God.

   He proceeds in the sixth chapter to mention the sanctification which we
   obtain in Christ. It is indeed natural to our flesh, as soon as it has
   had some slight knowledge of grace, to indulge quietly in its own vices
   and lusts, as though it had become free from all danger: but Paul, on
   the contrary, contends here, that we cannot partake of the
   righteousness of Christ, except we also lay hold on sanctification. He
   reasons from baptism, by which we are initiated into a participation of
   Christ, (per quem in Christi participationem initiamur;) and in it we
   are buried together with Christ, so that being dead in ourselves, we
   may through his life be raised to a newness of life. It then follows,
   that without regeneration no one can put on his righteousness. He hence
   deduces exhortations as to purity and holiness of life, which must
   necessarily appear in those who have been removed from the kingdom of
   sin to the kingdom of righteousness, the sinful indulgence of the
   flesh, which seeks in Christ a greater liberty in sinning, being cast
   aside. He makes also a brief mention of the law as being abrogated; and
   in the abrogation of this the New Testament shines forth eminently; for
   together with the remission of sins, it contains the promise of the
   Holy Spirit.

   In the seventh chapter he enters on a full discussion on the use of the
   law, which he had pointed out before as it were by the finger, while he
   had another subject in hand: he assigns a reason why we are loosed from
   the law, and that is, because it serves only for condemnation. Lest,
   however, he should expose the law to reproach, he clears it in the
   strongest terms from any imputation of this kind; for he shows that
   through our fault it is that the law, which was given for life, turns
   to be an occasion of death. He also explains how sin is by it
   increased. He then proceeds to describe the contest between the Spirit
   and the flesh, which the children of God find in themselves, as long as
   they are surrounded by the prison of a mortal body; for they carry with
   them the relics of lust, by which they are continually prevented from
   yielding full obedience to the law.

   The eighth chapter contains abundance of consolations, in order that
   the consciences of the faithful, having heard of the disobedience which
   he had before proved, or rather imperfect obedience, might not be
   terrified and dejected. But that the ungodly might not hence flatter
   themselves, he first testifies that this privilege belongs to none but
   to the regenerated, in whom the Spirit of God lives and prevails. He
   unfolds then two things -- that all who are planted by the Spirit in
   the Lord Jesus Christ, are beyond the danger or the chance of
   condemnation, however burdened they may yet be with sins; and, also,
   that all who remain in the flesh, being without the sanctification of
   the Spirit, are by no means partakers of this great benefit. He
   afterwards explains how great is the certainty of our confidence, since
   the Spirit of God by his own testimony drives away all doubts and
   fears. He further shows, for the purpose of anticipating objections,
   that the certainty of eternal life cannot be intercepted or disturbed
   by present evils, to which we are subject in this life; but that, on
   the contrary, our salvation is promoted by such trials, and that the
   value of it, when compared with our present miseries, renders them as
   nothing. He confirms this by the example of Christ, who, being the
   first-begotten and holding the highest station in the family of God, is
   the pattern to which we must all be conformed. And, in the last place,
   as though all things were made secure, he concludes in a most exulting
   strain, and boldly triumphs over all the power and artifices of Satan.

   But as most were much concerned on seeing the Jews, the first guardians
   and heirs of the covenant, rejecting Christ, for they hence concluded,
   that either the covenant was transferred from the posterity of Abraham,
   who disregarded the fulfilling of the covenant, or that he, who made no
   better provision for the people of Israel, was not the promised
   Redeemer -- he meets this objection at the beginning of the ninth
   chapter. Having then spoken of his love towards his own nation, that he
   might not appear to speak from hatred, and having also duly mentioned
   those privileges by which they excelled others, he gently glides to the
   point he had in view, that is, to remove the offence, which arose from
   their own blindness. And he divides the children of Abraham into two
   classes, that he might show that not all who descended from him
   according to the flesh, are to be counted for seed and become partakers
   of the grace of the covenant; but that, on the contrary, aliens become
   his children, when they possess his faith. He brings forward Jacob and
   Esau as examples. He then refers us back here to the election of God,
   on which the whole matter necessarily depends. Besides, as election
   rests on the mercy of God alone, it is in vain to seek the cause of it
   in the worthiness of man. There is, on the other hand, rejection
   (rejectio), the justice of which is indubitable, and yet there is no
   higher cause for it than the will of God. Near the end of the chapter,
   he sets forth the calling of the Gentiles and the rejection of the Jews
   as proved by the predictions of the Prophets.

   Having again begun, in the tenth chapter, by testifying his love
   towards the Jews, he declares that a vain confidence in their own works
   was the cause of their ruin; and lest they should pretend the law, he
   obviates their objection, and says, that we are even by the law itself
   led as it were by the hand to the righteousness of faith. He adds that
   this righteousness is through God's bountiful goodness offered
   indiscriminately to all nations, but that it is only apprehended by
   those, whom the Lord through special favor illuminates. And he states,
   that more from the Gentiles than from the Jews would obtain this
   benefit, as predicted both by Moses and by Isaiah; the one having
   plainly prophesied of the calling of the Gentiles, and the other of the
   hardening of the Jews.

   The question still remained, "Is there not a difference between the
   seed of Abraham and other nations according to the covenant of God?"
   Proceeding to answer this question, he first reminds us, that the work
   of God is not to be limited to what is seen by our eyes, since the
   elect often escape our observation; for Elias was formerly mistaken,
   when he thought that religion had become wholly extinct among the
   Israelites, when there were still remaining seven thousand; and,
   further, that we must not be perplexed by the number of unbelievers,
   who, as we see, hate the gospel. He at length alleges, that the
   covenant of God continues even to the posterity of Abraham according to
   the flesh, but to those only whom the Lord by a free election hath
   predestinated. He then turns to the Gentiles, and speaks to them, lest
   they should become insolent on account of their adoption, and exult
   over the Jews as having been rejected since they excel them in nothing,
   except in the free favor of the Lord, which ought to make them the more
   humble; and that this has not wholly departed from the seed of Abraham,
   for the Jews were at length to be provoked to emulation by the faith of
   the Gentiles, so that God would gather all Israel to himself.

   The three chapters which follow are admonitory, but they are various in
   their contents. The twelfth chapter contains general precepts on
   Christian life. The thirteenth, for the; most part, speaks of the
   authority of magistrates. We may hence undoubtedly gather that there
   were then some unruly persons, who thought Christian liberty could not
   exist without overturning the civil power. But that Paul might not
   appear to impose on the Church any duties but those of love, he
   declares that this obedience is included in what love requires. He
   afterwards adds those precepts, which he had before mentioned, for the
   guidance of our conduct. In the next chapter he gives an exhortation,
   especially necessary in that age: for as there were those who through
   obstinate superstition insisted on the observance of Mosaic rites, and
   could not endure the neglect of them without being most grievously
   offended; so there were others, who, being convinced of their
   abrogation, and anxious to pull down superstition, designedly showed
   their contempt of such things. Both parties offended through being too
   intemperate; for the superstitious condemned the others as being
   despisers of God's law; and the latter in their turn unreasonably
   ridiculed the simplicity of the former. Therefore the Apostle
   recommends to both a befitting moderation, deporting the one from
   superciliousness and insult, and the other from excessive moroseness:
   and he also prescribes the best way of exercising Christian liberty, by
   keeping within the boundaries of love and edification; and he
   faithfully provides for the weak, while he forbids them to do any thing
   in opposition to conscience.

   The fifteenth chapter begins with a repetition of the general argument,
   as a conclusion of the whole subject -- that the strong should use
   their strength in endeavours to confirm the weak. And as there was a
   perpetual discord, with regard to the Mosaic ceremonies, between the
   Jews and the Gentiles, he allays all emulation between them by removing
   the cause of contention; for he shows, that the salvation of both
   rested on the mercy of God alone; on which relying, they ought to lay
   aside all high thoughts of themselves and being thereby connected
   together in the hope of the same inheritance, they ought mutually to
   embrace one another. And being anxious, in the last place, to turn
   aside for the purpose of commending his own apostleship, which secured
   no small authority to his doctrine, he takes occasion to defend
   himself, and to deprecate presumption in having assumed with so much
   confidence the office of teacher among them. He further gives them some
   hope of his coming to them, which he had mentioned at the beginning,
   but had hitherto in vain looked for and tried to effect; and he states
   the reason which at that time hindered him, and that was, because the
   churches of Macedonia and Achaia had committed to him the care of
   conveying to Jerusalem those alms which they had given to relieve the
   wants of the faithful in that city.

   The last chapter is almost entirely taken up with salutations, though
   scattered with some precepts worthy of all attention; and concludes
   with a remarkable prayer.

     __________________________________________________________________

   1. Paul, etc. [11] -- With regard to the word Paul, as it is a subject
   of no such moment as ought to detain us, and as nothing can be said
   which has not been mentioned by other expounders, I should say nothing,
   were it not proper to satisfy some at small expense without being
   tedious to others; for the subject shall be despatched in a very few
   words.

   They who think that the Apostle attained this name as a trophy for
   having brought Sergius, the proconsul, to the faith of Christ, are
   confuted by the testimony of Luke, who shows that he was so called
   before that time. (Acts 13:7, 9.) Nor does it seem probable to me, that
   it was given him when he was converted to Christ; though this idea so
   pleased Augustine, that he took occasion refinedly to philosophize on
   the subject; for he says, that from a proud Saul he was made a very
   little (parvulum [12] ) disciple of Christ. More probable is the
   opinion of Origen, who thought that he had two names; for it is not
   unlikely to be true, that his name, Saul, derived from his kindred, was
   given him by his parents to indicate his religion and his descent; and
   that his other name, Paul, was added, to show his right to Roman
   citizenship; [13] they would not have this honor, then highly valued,
   to be otherwise than made evident; but they did not so much value it as
   to withhold a proof of his Israelitic descent. But he has commonly
   taken the name Paul in his Epistles, and it may be for the following
   reasons: because in the churches to which he wrote, it was more known
   and more common, more acceptable in the Roman empire, and less known
   among his own nation. It was indeed his duty to avoid the foolish
   suspicion and hatred under which the name of a Jew then labored among
   the Romans and in their provinces, and to abstain from inflaming the
   rage of his own countrymen, and to take care of himself.

   A servant of Jesus Christ, etc. -- He signalizes himself with these
   distinctions for the purpose of securing more authority to his
   doctrine; and this he seeks to secure by two things -- first, by
   asserting his call to the Apostleship; [14] and secondly, by showing
   that his call was not unconnected with the Church of Rome: for it was
   of great importance that he should be deemed an Apostle through God's
   call, and that he should be known as one destined for the Roman Church.
   He therefore says, that he was a servant of Christ, and called to the
   office of an Apostle, thereby intimating that he had not presumptuously
   intruded into that office. He then adds, that he was chosen, (selectum
   -- selected, [15] ) by which he more fully confirms the fact, that he
   was not one of the people, but a particular Apostle of the Lord.
   Consistently with this, he had before proceeded from what was general
   to what was particular, as the Apostleship was an especial service; for
   all who sustain the office of teaching are to be deemed Christ's
   servants, but Apostles, in point of honor, far exceed all others. But
   the choosing for the gospel, etc., which he afterwards mentions,
   expresses the end as well as the use of the Apostleship; for he
   intended briefly to show for what purpose he was called to that
   function. By saying then that he was servant of Christ, he declared
   what he had in common with other teachers; by claiming to himself the
   title of an Apostle, he put himself before others; but as no authority
   is due to him who willfully intrudes himself, he reminds us, that he
   was appointed by God.

   Then the meaning is, -- that Paul was a servant of Christ, not any kind
   of servant, but an Apostle, and that by the call of God, and not by
   presumptuous intrusion: then follows a clearer explanation of the
   Apostolic office, -- it was ordained for the preaching of the Gospel.
   For I cannot agree with those who refer this call of which he speaks to
   the eternal election of God; and who understand the separation, either
   that from his mother's womb, which he mentions in Galatians 1:15, or
   that which Luke refers to, when Paul was appointed for the Gentiles:
   but I consider that he simply glories in having God as the author of
   his call, lest any one should think that he had through his own
   rashness taken this honor to himself. [16]

   We must here observe, that all are not fitted for the ministry of the
   word; for a special call is necessary: and even those who seem
   particularly fitted ought to take heed lest they thrust themselves in
   without a call. But as to the character of the Apostolic and of the
   Episcopal call, we shall consider it in another place. We must further
   observe, that the office of an Apostle is the preaching of the gospel.
   It hence appears what just objects of ridicule are those dumb dogs, who
   render themselves conspicuous only by their mitre and their crook, and
   boast themselves to be the successors of the Apostles!

   The word, servant, imports nothing else but a minister, for it refers
   to what is official. [17] I mention this to remove the mistake of those
   who too much refine on this expression and think that there is here to
   be understood a contrast between the service of Moses and that of
   Christ.

   2. Which he had before promised, etc. -- As the suspicion of being new
   subtracts much from the authority of a doctrine, he confirms the faith
   of the gospel by antiquity; as though he said, "Christ came not on the
   earth unexpectedly, nor did he introduce a doctrine of a new kind and
   not heard of before, inasmuch as he, and his gospel too, had been
   promised and expected from the beginning of the world." But as
   antiquity is often fabulous, he brings witnesses, and those approved,
   even the Prophets of God, that he might remove every suspicion. He in
   the third place adds, that their testimonies were duly recorded, that
   is, in the Holy Scriptures.

   We may learn from this passage what the gospel is: he teaches us, not
   that it was promulgated by the Prophets but only promised. If then the
   Prophets promised the gospel, it follows, that it was revealed, when
   our Lord was at length manifested in the flesh. They are then mistaken
   who confound the promises with the gospel, since the gospel is properly
   the appointed preaching of Christ as manifested, in whom the promises
   themselves are exhibited. [18]

   3. Concerning his own Son, etc. -- This is a remarkable passage, by
   which we are taught that the whole gospel is included in Christ, so
   that if any removes one step from Christ, he withdraws himself from the
   gospel. For since he is the living and express image of the Father, it
   is no wonder, that he alone is set before us as one to whom our whole
   faith is to be directed and in whom it is to center. It is then a
   definition of the gospel, by which Paul expresses what is summarily
   comprehended in it. I have rendered the words which follow, Jesus
   Christ our Lord, in the same case; which seems to me to be most
   agreeable with the context. We hence learn, that he who has made a due
   proficiency in the knowledge of Christ, has acquired every thing which
   can be learned from the gospel; and, on the other hand, that they who
   seek to be wise without Christ, are not only foolish, but even
   completely insane.

   Who was made, etc. -- Two things must be found in Christ, in order that
   we may obtain salvation in him, even divinity and humanity. His
   divinity possesses power, righteousness, life, which by his humanity
   are conveyed to us. Hence the Apostle has expressly mentioned both in
   the Summary he gives of the gospel, that Christ was manifested in the
   flesh -- and that in it he declared himself to be the Son of God. So
   John says; after having declared that the Word was made flesh, he adds,
   that in that flesh there was a glory as of the only-begotten Son of
   God. (John 1:14.) That he specially notices the descent and lineage of
   Christ from his ancestor David, is not superfluous; for by this he
   calls back our attention to the promise, that we may not doubt but that
   he is the very person who had been formerly promised. So well known was
   the promise made to David, that it appears to have been a common thing
   among the Jews to call the Messiah the Son of David. This then -- that
   Christ did spring from David -- was said for the purpose of confirming
   our faith.

   He adds, according to the flesh; and he adds this, that we may
   understand that he had something more excellent than flesh, which he
   brought from heaven, and did not take from David, even that which he
   afterwards mentions, the glory of the divine nature. Paul does further
   by these words not only declare that Christ had real flesh, but he also
   clearly distinguishes his human from his divine nature; and thus he
   refutes the impious raving of Servetus, who assigned flesh to Christ,
   composed of three untreated elements.

   4. Declared [19] the Son of God, etc.: or, if you prefer, determined
   (definitus); as though he had said, that the power, by which he was
   raised from the dead, was something like a decree by which he was
   proclaimed the Son of God, according to what is said in Psalm 2:7, "I
   have this day begotten thee:" for this begetting refers to what was
   made known. Though some indeed find here three separate evidences of
   the divinity of Christ -- "power," understanding thereby miracles --
   then the testimony of the Spirit -- and, lastly, the resurrection from
   the dead -- I yet prefer to connect them together, and to reduce these
   three things to one, in this manner -- that Christ was declared the Son
   of God by openly exercising a real celestial power, that is, the power
   of the Spirit, when he rose from the dead; but that this power is
   comprehended, when a conviction of it is imprinted on our hearts by the
   same Spirit. The language of the Apostle well agrees with this view;
   for he says that he was declared by power, because power, peculiar to
   God, shone forth in him, and uncontestably proved him to be God; and
   this was indeed made evident by his resurrection. Paul says the same
   thing in another place; having stated, that by death the weakness of
   the flesh appeared, he at the same time extols the power of the Spirit
   in his resurrection; (2 Corinthians 13:4) This glory, however, is not
   made known to us, until the same Spirit imprints a conviction of it on
   our hearts. And that Paul includes, together with the wonderful energy
   of the Spirit, which Christ manifested by rising from the dead, the
   testimony which all the faithful feel in their hearts, is even evident
   from this -- that he expressly calls it the Spirit of Holiness; as
   though he had said, that the Spirit, as far as it sanctifies, confirms
   and ratifies that evidence of its power which it once exhibited. For
   the Scripture is wont often to ascribe such titles to the Spirit, as
   tend to illustrate our present subject. Thus He is called by our Lord
   the Spirit of Truth, on account of the effect which he mentions; (John
   14:17)

   Besides, a divine power is said to have shone forth in the resurrection
   of Christ for this reason -- because he rose by his own power, as he
   had often testified:

   "Destroy this temple, and in three days
   I will raise it up again," (John 2:19;)

   "No man taketh it from me," etc.; (John 10:18)

   For he gained victory over death, (to which he yielded with regard to
   the weakness of the flesh,) not by aid sought from another, but by the
   celestial operation of his own Spirit.

   5. Through whom we have received, etc. -- Having completed his
   definition of the gospel, which he introduced for the recommendation of
   his office, he now returns to speak of his own call; and it was a great
   point that this should be proved to the Romans. By mentioning grace and
   apostleship apart, he adopts a form of speech, [20] which must be
   understood as meaning, gratuitous apostleship or the favor of the
   apostleship; by which he means, that it was wholly through divine
   favor, not through his own worthiness, that he had been chosen for so
   high an office. For though it has hardly any thing connected with it in
   the estimation of the world, except dangers, labors, hatred, and
   disgrace; yet before God and his saints, it possesses a dignity of no
   common or ordinary kind. It is therefore deservedly counted a favor. If
   you prefer to say, "I have received grace that I should be an Apostle,"
   the sense would be the same. [21]

   The expression, on account of his name, is rendered by Ambrose, "in his
   name," as though it meant, that the Apostle was appointed in the place
   of Christ to preach the gospel, according to that passage, "We are
   ambassadors for Christ," etc. (2 Corinthians 5:20.) Their opinion,
   however, seems better, who take name for knowledge; for the gospel is
   preached for this end -- that we may believe on the name of the Son of
   God. (John 3:23.) And Paul is said to have been a chosen vessel, to
   carry the name of Christ among the Gentiles. (Acts 9:15.) On account
   then of his name, which means the same, as though he had said, that I
   might make known what Christ is. [22]

   For the obedience of faith, etc. -- That is, we have received a command
   to preach the gospel among all nations, and this gospel they obey by
   faith. By stating the design of his calling, he again reminds the
   Romans of his office, as though he said, "It is indeed my duty to
   discharge the office committed to me, which is to preach the word; and
   it is your duty to hear the word and willingly to obey it; you will
   otherwise make void the vocation which the Lord has bestowed on me."

   We hence learn, that they perversely resist the authority of God and
   upset the whole of what he has ordained, who irreverently and
   contemptuously reject the preaching of the gospel; the design of which
   is to constrain us to obey God. We must also notice here what faith is;
   the name of obedience is given to it, and for this reason -- because
   the Lord calls us by his gospel; we respond to his call by faith; as on
   the other hand, the chief act of disobedience to God is unbelief, I
   prefer rendering the sentence, "For the obedience of faith," rather
   than, "In order that they may obey the faith;" for the last is not
   strictly correct, except taken figuratively, though it be found once in
   the Acts 6:7. Faith is properly that by which we obey the gospel. [23]

   Among all nations, etc. It was not enough for him to have been
   appointed an Apostle, except his ministry had reference to some who
   were to be taught: hence he adds, that his apostleship extended to all
   nations. He afterwards calls himself more distinctly the Apostle of the
   Romans, when he says, that they were included in the number of the
   nations, to whom he had been given as a minister. And further, the
   Apostles had in common the command to preach the gospel to all the
   world; and they were not, as pastors and bishops, set over certain
   churches. But Paul, in addition to the general undertaking of the
   apostolic function, was constituted, by a special appointment, to be a
   minister to proclaim the gospel among the Gentiles. It is no objection
   to this, that he was forbidden to pass through Macedonia and to preach
   the word in Mysia: for this was done, not that there were limits
   prescribed to him, but that he was for a time to go elsewhere; for the
   harvest was not as yet ripe there.

   Ye are the called of Jesus Christ, etc. He assigns a reason more nearly
   connected with them -- because the Lord had already exhibited in them
   an evidence by which he had manifested that he had called them to a
   participation of the gospel. It hence followed, that if they wished
   their own calling to remain sure, they were not to reject the ministry
   of Paul, who had been chosen by the same election of God. I therefore
   take this clause, "the called of Jesus Christ," as explanatory, as
   though the particle "even" were inserted; for he means, that they were
   by calling made partakers of Christ. For they who shall be heirs of
   eternal life, are chosen by the celestial Father to be children in
   Christ; and when chosen, they are committed to his care and protection
   as their shepherd. [24]

   7. To all of you who are at Rome, etc. By this happy arrangement he
   sets forth what there is in us worthy of commendation; he says, that
   first the Lord through his own kindness made us the objects of his
   favor and love; and then that he has called us; and thirdly, that he
   has called us to holiness: but this high honor only then exists, when
   we are not wanting to our call.

   Here a rich truth presents itself to us, to which I shall briefly
   refer, and leave it to be meditated upon by each individual: Paul does
   by no means ascribe the praise of our salvation to ourselves, but
   derives it altogether from the fountain of God's free and paternal love
   towards us; for he makes this the first thing -- God loves us: and what
   is the cause of his love, except his own goodness alone? On this
   depends our calling, by which in his own time he seals his adoption to
   those whom he had before freely chosen. We also learn from this passage
   that none rightly connect themselves with the number of the faithful,
   except they feel assured that the Lord is gracious, however unworthy
   and wretched sinners they may be, and except they be stimulated by his
   goodness and aspire to holiness, for he hath not called us to
   uncleanness, but to holiness. (1 Thessalonians 4:7.) As the Greek can
   be rendered in the second person, I see no reason for any change.

   Grace to you and peace, etc. Nothing is more desirable than to have God
   propitious to us, and this is signified by grace; and then to have
   prosperity and success in all things flowing from him, and this is
   intimated by peace; for however things may seem to smile on us, if God
   be angry, even blessing itself is turned to a curse. The very
   foundation then of our felicity is the favor of God, by which we enjoy
   true and solid prosperity, and by which also our salvation is promoted
   even when we are in adversities. [25] And then as he prays to God for
   peace, we must understand, that whatever good comes to us, it is the
   fruit of divine benevolence. Nor must we omit to notice, that he prays
   at the same time to the Lord Jesus Christ for these blessings. Worthily
   indeed is this honor rendered to him, who is not only the administrator
   and dispenser of his Father's bounty to us, but also works all things
   in connection with him. It was, however, the special object of the
   Apostle to show, that through him all God's blessings come to us. [26]

   There are those who prefer to regard the word peace as signifying
   quietness of conscience; and that this meaning belongs to it sometimes,
   I do not deny: but since it is certain that the Apostle wished to give
   us here a summary of God's blessings, the former meaning, which is
   adduced by Bucer, is much the most suitable. Anxiously wishing then to
   the godly what makes up real happiness, he betakes himself, as he did
   before, to the very fountain itself, even the favor of God, which not
   only alone brings to us eternal felicity but is also the source of all
   blessings in this life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [11] "The inscription of the Pauline Epistles," says Turrettin, "is
   according to the manner of the ancients, both Greeks and Romans. They
   were wont to prefix their name; and to those to whom they wrote they
   added their good wishes." We have an example in Acts 23:26. -- Ed.

   [12] Thereby expressing the meaning of Paulus, which in Latin is
   little. "Paul," says the quaint Elnathan Parr, "as signifies little,
   and indeed not unfitly, for he is reported to have been low in stature,
   and to have had a very small voice," which is thought to have been
   objected to him in 2 Corinthians 10:10 -- Ed.

   [13] Most writers agree in this view, regarding Saul as his Hebrew name
   and Paul as his Roman name. -- Ed.

   [14] "A called Apostle -- vocatus apostolus -- kletos apostolos;" our
   version is, "called to be an Apostle". Most consider "called" here in
   the sense of chosen or elected, "a chosen Apostle." Professor Stuart
   observes, that kletos in the writings of Paul has always the meaning of
   efficient calling, and signifies not only the invited, but the
   effectually invited. He refers to 1 Corinthians 1:1, 2; 1 Corinthians
   1:24; Romans 1:6, 7; Romans 8:28; compared with Galatians 1:15; Jude
   1:1; Hebrews 3:1; Romans 11:29; Ephesians 4:1 He was an Apostle by a
   call, or as Beza renders it, "by the call of God -- ex Dei vocatione
   apostolus." The meaning is the same as what he himself expresses it in
   Galatians 1:1. Turrettin renders it, "Apostolus vocatione divina -- an
   Apostle by divine vocation." The difference between "a called Apostle"
   and "called to be an Apostle," is this, that the first conveys the idea
   that he obeyed the call, and the other does not. -- Ed.

   [15] Aphorismenos separated, set apart; "segregatus," Vulgate;
   "separatus, Beza. "The Pharisees," says Leigh, "were termed
   aphorismenos we may English them Separatists: they separated themselves
   to the study of the law, in which respect they might be called
   aphorismenos eis ton nomon, separated to the law. In allusion to this,
   saith Drusius, the Apostle is thought to have styled himself, Romans
   1:1, aphorismenon eis euangelion, separated unto the Gospel, when he
   was called from being a Pharisee to be a preacher of the Gospel."
   Separated is the word adopted both by Doddridge and Macknight, as well
   as by our own version. -- Ed.

   [16] Some combine the four separations. "Set apart in the eternal
   counsel of God, and from his mother's womb, Galatians 1:15, and by the
   special commandment of the Holy Ghost, Acts 13:2, confirmed by
   constitution of the Church, Acts 13:3; Galatians 2:9." -- Parr. But the
   object here seems to have been that stated by Calvin: nor is it just or
   prudent to connect any other idea with the word except that which the
   context requires; for to do so only tends to create confusion. -- Ed.

   [17] Moses, Joshua, David, Nehemiah, etc., where, in a similar sense,
   called servants; and also our Savior. They were officially servants. --
   Ed

   [18] The verb is proepengeilato only here; it comes from epangellomai,
   which Schleusner says, means in the middle voice, to promise. "Which he
   had before promised." is then the proper rendering, and not "Which he
   formerly published," as proposed by Professor Stuart. Both Doddridge
   and Macknight have retained our version, with which that of Beza
   agrees. -- Ed.

   [19] "Declaratus," horisthentos. Some of the ancients, such as Origen,
   Chrysostom, Cyril, and others, have given to this verb the meaning of
   is "proved -- deichthentos;" demonstrated -- apophanthentos;"
   "exhibited -- apodeichthontos;"etc. But it is said that the word has
   not this meaning in the New Testament, and that it means, limited,
   determined, decreed, constituted. Besides here, it is found only in
   Luke 22:22; Acts 2:23; Acts 10:42; Acts 11:29; Acts 17:26; Hebrews 4:7.
   The word, determined, or constituted, if adopted here, would amount to
   the same thing, that is, that Christ was visibly determined or
   constituted the Son of God through the resurrection, or by that event.
   It was that which fixed, settled, determined, and manifestly exhibited
   him as the Son of God, clothed and adorned with his own power.
   Professor Stuart has conjured a number of difficulties in connection
   with this verse, for which there seems to be no solid reason. The
   phrase, the Son of God, is so well known from the usage of Scripture,
   that there is no difficulty connected with it: the full phrase is the
   only-begotten Son. To say that Christ's resurrection was no evidence of
   his divine nature, as Lazarus and others had been raised from the dead,
   appears indeed very strange. Did Lazarus rise through his own power?
   Did Lazarus rise again for our justification? Was his resurrection an
   attestation of any thing he had previously declared? The Revelation A.
   Barnes very justly says, that the circumstances connected with Christ
   were those which rendered his resurrection a proof of his divinity.
   Professor Hodge gives what he conceives to be the import of the two
   verses in these words, "Jesus Christ was, as to his human nature, the
   Son of David; but he was clearly demonstrated to be, as to his divine
   nature, the Son of God, by the resurrection from the dead." This view
   is taken by many, such as Pareus, Beza, Turrettin, etc. But the words,
   "according to the Spirit of Holiness" -- kata pneuma hagiosunes, are
   taken differently by others, as meaning the Holy Spirit. As the phrase
   is nowhere else found, it may be taken in either sense. That the divine
   nature of Christ is called Spirit, is evident. See 1 Corinthians 15:45;
   2 Corinthians 3:17; Hebrews 9:14, 1 Peter 3:18 Doddridge, Scott, and
   Chalmers, consider The Holy Spirit to be intended. The last gives this
   paraphrase: -- "Declared, or determinately marked out to be the Son of
   God and with power. The thing was demonstrated by an evidence, the
   exhibition of which required a putting forth of power, which Paul in
   another place represents as a very great and strenuous exertion,
   According to the working of his mighty power when he raised him from
   the dead.' -- The Spirit of Holiness, or the Holy Spirit. It was
   through the operation of the Holy Spirit that the divine nature was
   infused into the human at the birth of Jesus Christ; and the very same
   agent, it is remarkable, was employed in the work of the resurrection.
   Put to death in the flesh,' says Peter, and quickened by the Spirit.'
   We have only to do with the facts of the case. He was demonstrated to
   be the Son of God by the power of the Holy Spirit having been put forth
   in raising him from the dead." As to the genitive case after
   "resurrection," see a similar instance in Acts 17:32 The idea deduced
   by Calvin, that he is called here "the Spirit of Holiness," on account
   of the holiness he works in us, seems not well-founded, though advanced
   by Theodoret and Augustine. -- Ed.

   [20] "Hypellage," a figure in grammar, by which a noun or an adjective
   is put in a form or in a case different from that in which it ought
   grammatically to be. -- Ed.

   [21] If this view be taken, the best mode would be to render kai, even
   "favor, even the apostleship." But, as Wolfius says, "both words would
   perhaps be better rendered separately, and "grace" or favor be referred
   to the conversion of the Apostle himself, and "apostleship" to his
   office. See 1 Timothy 1:12-14, and Acts 9:15, Acts 13:2; Acts 22:21. --
   Ed

   [22] He has taken this clause before that which follows, contrary to
   the order of the text, because he viewed it as connected with the
   receiving of the apostleship. "Pro nomine ipsius," -- huper tou
   onomatos autou; "ad nominis ejus gloriam -- to the glory of his name,"
   Turrettin; "for the purpose of magnifying his name," Chalmers Hodge
   observes, "Paul was an apostle that all nations might be obedient, to
   the honor of Jesus Christ, that is, so that his name may be known."
   Some, as Tholuck, connect the words with "obedience to the faith," as
   they render the phrase, and, in this sense, "that obedience might be
   rendered to the faith among all nations for the sake of his name." But
   it is better to connect the words with the receiving of the
   apostleship: it was received for two purposes -- that there might be
   the obedience of faith, and that the name of Christ might be magnified.
   -- Ed.

   [23] It might be rendered, "that there might be the obedience of
   faith," or, "in order to produce," or, "Promote the obedience of
   faith." The obedience is faith. The command is, "believe," and the
   obedience must correspond with it. To obey the faith, as in Acts 6:7,
   is a different form of expression: the article is prefixed there, it is
   the faith, meaning the gospel. -- See 2 Thessalonians 1:8. Professor
   Stuart and Haldane, agree in this view. The latter refers to Romans
   10:3, where the Israelites are charged for not submitting to God's
   righteousness; and, in verse 16, it is said, that they had not all
   obeyed the gospel, "for Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our
   report?" Then to believe the gospel is in an especial manner to obey
   it. -- Ed.

   [24] "The called of Jesus Christ," i.e., the called who belong to
   Christ. Kletos means, not only those to whom the external call of the
   gospel has been addressed, but those who have been also internally
   called." -- Stuart. The same author renders the words kletois hagiois,
   in the next verse, "chosen saints," or, "saints effectually called." --
   Ed.

   [25] "The ancient Greeks and Romans," says Turrettin, "wished to those
   to whom they wrote, in the inscription of their epistles, health, joy,
   happiness; but Paul prays for far higher blessings even the favor of
   God, the fountain of all good things, and peace, in which the Hebrews
   included all blessings." -- Ed.

   [26] "From God our Father, -- if God, then able; if our Father, then
   willing to enrich us with his gifts: and from our Lord Jesus Christ, --
   from our Lord, who has purchased them for us; from Jesus, for without
   these we cannot be saved; from Christ, for he is anointed with grace
   and peace, John 1:16." -- Parr

   Romans 1:8-12

   8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
   faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

   8. Primum quidem gratias ago Deo meo per Iesum Christum super vobis
   omnibus, quia fides vestra Pr����dicatur in universo mundo.

   9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of
   his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
   prayers;

   9. Testis enim mihi Deus, quem colo in spiritu meo in Evangelio Filii
   ipsius, ut continenter memoriam vestri faciam;

   10. Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
   prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

   10. Semper in orationibus meis, [27] rogans, si quomodo prosperum iter
   aliquando mihi, obtingat per voluntatem Dei, veniendi ad vos.

   11. For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
   gift, to the end ye may be established;

   11. Desidero enim videre, vos, ut aliquod impertiar vobis donum
   spirituale ad vos confirmandos;

   12. That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual
   faith both of you and me.

   12. Hoc est. ad cohortationem mutuo percipiendam in vobis per Mutuam
   fidem, vestram atque meam.

   8. I first [28] indeed, etc. Here the beginning commences, altogether
   adapted to the occasion, as he seasonably prepares them for receiving
   instruction by reasons connected with himself as well as with them.
   What he states respecting them is, the celebrity of their faith; for he
   intimates that they being honored with the public approbation of the
   churches, could not reject an Apostle of the Lord, without
   disappointing the good opinion entertained of them by all; and such a
   thing would have been extremely uncourteous and in a manner bordering
   on perfidy. As then this testimony justly induced the Apostle, by
   affording him an assurance of their obedience, to undertake, according
   to his office, to teach and instruct the Romans; so it held them bound
   not to despise his authority. With regard to himself, he disposes them
   to a teachable spirit by testifying his love towards them: and there is
   nothing more effectual in gaining credit to an adviser, than the
   impression that he is cordially anxious to consult our wellbeing.

   The first thing worthy of remark is, that he so commends their faith,
   [29] that he implies that it had been received from God. We are here
   taught that faith is God's gift; for thanksgiving is an acknowledgment
   of a benefit. He who gives thanks to God for faith, confesses that it
   comes from him. And since we find that the Apostle ever begins his
   congratulations with thanksgiving, let us know that we are hereby
   reminded, that all our blessings are God's free gifts. It is also
   needful to become accustomed to such forms of speaking, that we may be
   led more fully to rouse ourselves in the duty of acknowledging God as
   the giver of all our blessings, and to stir up others to join us in the
   same acknowledgment. If it be right to do this in little things, how
   much more with regard to faith; Which is neither a small nor an
   indiscriminate (promiscua) gift of God. We have here besides an
   example, that thanks ought to be given through Christ, according to the
   Apostle's command in Hebrews 13:15; inasmuch as in his name we seek and
   obtain mercy from the Father. -- I observe in the last place, that he
   calls him his God. This is the faithful's special privilege, and on
   them alone God bestows this honor. There is indeed implied in this a
   mutual relationship, which is expressed in this promise,

   "I will be to them a God;
   they shall be to me a people." (Jeremiah 30:22.)

   I prefer at the same time to confine this to the character which Paul
   sustained, as an attestation of his obedience to the end in the work of
   preaching the gospel. So Hezekiah called God the God of Isaiah, when he
   desired him to give him the testimony of a true and faithful Prophet.
   (Isaiah 37:4.) So also he is called in an especial manner the God of
   Daniel. (Daniel 6:20.)

   Through the whole world. The eulogy of faithful men was to Paul equal
   to that of the whole world, with regard to the faith of the Romans; for
   the unbelieving, who deemed it detestable, could not have given an
   impartial or a correct testimony respecting it. We then understood that
   it was by the mouths of the faithful that the faith of the Romans was
   proclaimed through the whole world; and that they were alone able to
   judge rightly of it, and to pronounce a correct opinion. That this
   small and despised handful of men were unknown as to their character to
   the ungodly, even at Rome, was a circumstance he regarded as nothing;
   for Paul made no account of their judgment.

   9. For God is my witness, etc. He proves his love by its effects; for
   had he not greatly loved them, he would not have so anxiously commended
   them to the Lord, and especially he would not have so ardently desired
   to promote their welfare by his own labors. His anxiety then and his
   ardent desire were certain evidences of his love; for had they not
   sprung from it, they would never have existed. And as he knew it to be
   necessary for establishing confidence in his preaching, that the Romans
   should be fully persuaded of his sincerity, he added an oath -- a
   needful remedy, whenever a declaration, which ought to be received as
   true and indubitable vacillates through uncertainty. For since an oath
   is nothing else but an appeal to God as to the truth of what we
   declare, most foolish is it to deny that the Apostle used here an oath.
   He did not notwithstanding transgress the prohibition of Christ.

   It hence appears that it was not Christ's design (as the superstitious
   Anabaptists dream) to abolish oaths altogether, but on the contrary to
   call attention to the due observance of the law; and the law, allowing
   an oath, only condemns perjury and needless swearing. If then we would
   use an oath aright, let us imitate the seriousness and the reverent
   manner exhibited by the Apostles; and that you may understand what it
   is, know that God is so called as a witness, that he is also appealed
   to as an avenger, in case we deceive; which Paul expresses elsewhere in
   these words,

   "God is a witness to my soul." (2 Corinthians 1:23.) [30]

   Whom I serve with my spirit, etc. It is usual with profane men, who
   trifle with God, to pretend his name, no less boldly than
   presumptuously; but the Apostle here speaks of his own piety, in order
   to gain credit; and those, in whom the fear of God and reverence for
   his name prevail, will dread to swear falsely. At the same time, he
   sets his own spirit in opposition to the outward mask of religion; for
   as many falsely pretend to be the worshippers of God, and outwardly
   appear to be so, he testifies that he, from the heart served, God. [31]
   It may be also that he alluded to the ancient ceremonies, in which
   alone the Jews thought the worship of God consisted. He then intimates,
   that though he retained not observance of these, he was yet a sincere
   worshipper of God, according to what he says in Philippians 3:3,

   "We are the true circumcision, who in spirit serve God,
   and glory not in the flesh."

   He then glories that he served God with sincere devotion of heart,
   which is true religion and approved worship.

   But it was expedient, as I have said, in order that his oath might
   attain more credit, that Paul should declare his piety towards God; for
   perjury is a sport to the ungodly, while the pious dread it more than a
   thousand deaths; inasmuch as it cannot be, but that where there is a
   real fear of God, there must be also a reverence for his name. It is
   then the same thing, as though Paul had said, that he knew how much
   sacredness and sincerity belonged to an oath, and that he did not
   rashly appeal to God as a witness, as the profane are wont to do. And
   thus, by his own example, he teaches us, that whenever we swear, we
   ought to give such evidence of piety, that the name of God, which we
   use in our declarations, may retain its sacredness. And further, he
   gives a proof, even by his own ministry, that he worshipped not God
   feignedly; for it was the fullest evidence, that he was a man devoted
   to God's glory, when he denied himself, and hesitated not to undergo
   all the hardships of reproach, poverty, and hatred, and even the peril
   of death, in advancing the kingdom of God. [32]

   Some take this clause, as though Paul intended to recommend that
   worship which he said he rendered to God, on this account, -- because
   it corresponded with what the gospel prescribes. It is indeed certain
   that spiritual worship is enjoined on us in the gospel; but the former
   interpretation is far the most suitable, -- that he devoted his service
   to God in preaching the gospel. He, however, makes at the same time a
   difference between himself and hypocrites, who have something else in
   view rather than to serve God; for ambition, or some such thing,
   influences most men; and it is far from being the case, that all engage
   cordially and faithfully in this office. The meaning is, that Paul
   performed sincerely the office of teaching; for what he says of his own
   devotion he applies to this subject.

   But we hence gather a profitable doctrine; for it ought to add no
   little encouragement to the ministers of the gospel, when they hear
   that, in preaching the gospel, they render an acceptable and a valuable
   service to God. What, indeed, is there to prevent them from regarding
   it an excellent service, when they know that their labor is pleasing to
   God, and is approved by him? Moreover, he calls it the gospel of the
   Son of God; for Christ is in it made known, who has been appointed by
   the Father for this end, -- that he, being glorified, should also
   glorify the Father.

   That continually, etc. He still further sets forth the ardor of his
   love by his very constancy in praying for them. It was, indeed, a
   strong evidence, when he poured forth no prayers to the Lord without
   making mention of them. That the meaning may be clearer, I render
   pantote, "always;" as though it was said, "In all my prayers," or,
   "whenever I address God in prayer, I join a mention of you." [33] Now
   he speaks not of every kind of calling on God, but of those prayers to
   which the saints, being at liberty, and laying aside all cares, apply
   their whole attention to the work; for he might have often expressed
   suddenly this or that wish, when the Romans did not come into his mind;
   but whenever he had previously intended, and, as it were, prepared
   himself to offer up prayers to God, among others he remembered them. He
   then speaks peculiarly of those prayers, for which the saints
   deliberately prepare themselves; as we find to have been the case with
   our Lord himself, who, for this purpose, sought retirement. He at the
   same time intimates how frequently, or rather, how unceasingly he was
   engaged in such prayers, since he says that he prayed continually.

   10. Requesting, if by any means, etc. As it is not probable that we
   from the heart study his benefit, whom we are not ready to assist by
   our labors, he now adds, after having said that he was anxious for
   their welfare, that he showed by another proof his love to them, as
   before God, even by requesting that he might be able to advance their
   interest. That you may, therefore, perceive the full meaning, read the
   words as though the word also were inserted, requesting also, if by any
   means, etc. By saying, A prosperous journey by the will of God he
   shows, not only that he looked to the Lord's favor for success in his
   journey, but that he deemed his journey prosperous, if it was approved
   by the Lord. According to this model ought all our wishes to be formed.

   11. For I greatly desire to see you He might, indeed, while absent,
   have confirmed their faith by his doctrine; but as advice is better
   taken from one present, he had a desire to be with them. But he
   explains what his object was, and shows that he wished to undertake the
   toil of a journey, not for his own, but for their advantage. --
   Spiritual gifts [34] he calls those which he possessed, being either
   those of doctrine, or of exhortation, or of prophesy which he knew had
   come to him through God's favor. He has here strikingly pointed out the
   use of gifts by the word, imparting: for different gifts are
   distributed to each individual, that all may in kindness mutually
   assist one another, and transfer to others what each one possesses. See
   Romans 12:3; and 1 Corinthians 12:11

   To confirm you, etc. He modifies what he had said of imparting, lest he
   should seem to regard them such as were yet to be instructed in the
   first elements of religion, as though they were not hitherto rightly
   taught in Christ. He then says, that he wished so to lend his aid to
   them, that they who had for the most part made a proficiency, might be
   further assisted: for a confirmation is what we all want, until Christ
   be fully formed in us. (Ephesians 4:13.)

   12. Being not satisfied with this modest statement, he qualifies it,
   and shows, that he did not so occupy the place of a teacher, but that
   he wished to learn also from them; as though he said, "I desire so to
   confirm you according to the measure of grace conferred on me, that
   your example may also add courage (alacritatem -- alacrity) to my
   faith, and that we may thus mutually benefit one another."

   See to what degree of modesty his pious heart submitted itself, so that
   he disdained not to seek confirmation from unexperienced beginners: nor
   did he speak dissemblingly, for there is no one so void of gifts in the
   Church of Christ, who is not able to contribute something to our
   benefit: but we are hindered by our envy and by our pride from
   gathering such fruit from one another. Such is our high-mindedness,
   such is the inebriety produced by vain reputation, that despising and
   disregarding others, every one thinks that he possesses what is
   abundantly sufficient for himself. I prefer to read with Bucer,
   exhortation (exhortationem -- encouragement) rather than consolatim;
   for it agrees better with the former part. [35]

   [30] The passage in Matthew 5:33-37, has been often wholly

   is quite evident from what the passage itself contains. In solemn oaths
   there was no swearing by "heaven," or by "God's throne," or by "the
   earth," or by "Jerusalem," or by "the head." such forms were only used
   in conversation, as similar ones are still used: and these kinds of
   swearing are alone condemned by our Savior. -- Ed.

   Beza. "I serve God, not in teaching legal rites, but a much more
   celestial doctrine," Grotius

   [33] The order of the words, as arranged by Calvin, is better than that
   of our version; he connects "always in my prayers," or, "in all my
   prayers," with "requesting." The simpler rendering would be as follows:
   -- 9. My witness indeed is God, whom I serve with my spirit in the
   gospel of his Son, that I unceasingly make mention of you, always
   requesting in my prayers, 10. That by some means now at length I may,
   through the will of God, have a free course to come to you. "In the
   gospel," may either mean "according to the gospel," or, "in preaching
   the gospel." Hodge prefers the first. The particle ei clearly means
   "that" in this connection. That it is used in this sense in the New
   Testament there can be no doubt; see Acts 26:8, 23; Hebrews 7:15

   [34] The words, ti charisma pneumatikon, some spiritual gift, or
   benefit, seem to be of general import. Some, such as Chalmers and
   Haldane, have supposed that a miraculous power is intended, which the
   Apostles alone conveyed, such as the power of speaking with tongues:
   but most Commentators agree in the view here given. The phrase is not
   found in any other place: charisma, in the plural number, is used to
   designate miraculous powers. 1 Corinthians 12:9; and ta pneumatika mean
   the same, 1 Corinthians 14:1. But here, no doubt, the expression
   includes any gift or benefit, whether miraculous or ordinary, which the
   Apostle might have been made the means of conveying. -- Ed.

   [35] The verb is sumparaklethonai, which Grotius connects with epipotho
   in the preceding verse; and adds, "He softens what he had said, by
   showing, that he would not only bring some joy to them, but they also
   to him." "Ut percipiam consolationem -- that I may receive
   consolation," Piscator; -- "Ut un��  recreemur -- that we may be together

   ex vobis precipiam -- that I may receive joy and pleasure from you;"
   vel, "Ut mutuo solatio invicem nos erigamus atque firmemus -- that by
   mutual comfort we may console and strengthen one another," Schleusner
   The verb with the prefix, sum, is only found here; but the verb
   parakaleo frequently occurs, and its common meaning is, to beseech, to
   exhort to encourage, and by these means to comfort. With regard to this
   passage, Professor Stuart says, "I have rendered the word, comfort,
   only because I cannot find any English word which will convey the full
   sense of the original." "The word rendered to comfort," says Professor
   Hodge, "means to invite, to exhort, to instruct, to console, etc. Which
   of these senses is to be preferred here, it is not easy to decide. Most
   probably the Apostle intended to use the word in a wide sense, as
   expressing the idea, that he might be excited, encouraged, and
   comforted by his intercourse with his Christian brethren." -- The two
   verses may be thus rendered: -- 11. For I desire much to see you, that
   I may impart to you spiritual 12. benefit, so that you may be
   strengthened: this also is what I desire, to be encouraged together
   with you, through the faith which is in both, even in you and in me.

   Romans 1:13-15

   13. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
   purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have
   some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

   13. Nolo ver���� vos ignorare, fratres, quod s����pe proposui venire ad vos,
   et impeditus sum hactenus, ut fructum aliquem haberem in vobis, sicut
   et in reliquis gentibus.

   14. I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the
   wise, and to the unwise.

   14. Et Gr����cis et Barbaris et sapientibus et stultis debitor sum.

   15. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
   that are at Rome also.

   15. Itaque quantum in me est, paratus sum vobis quoque qui Romae estis
   Evangelizare.

   13. I would not that you should be ignorant. What he has hitherto
   testified -- that he continually requested of the Lord that he might
   visit them, might have appeared a vain thing, and could not have
   obtained credit, had he neglected to seize the occasion when offered:
   he therefore says, that the effort had not been wanting, but the
   opportunity; for he had been prevented from executing a purpose often
   formed.

   We hence learn that the Lord frequently upsets the purposes of his
   saints, in order to humble them, and by such humiliation to teach them
   to regard his Providence, that they may rely on it; though the saints,
   who design nothing without the Lord's will, cannot be said, strictly
   speaking, to be driven away from their purposes. It is indeed the
   presumption of impiety to pass by God, and without him to determine on
   things to come, as though they were in our own power; and this is what
   James sharply reprehends in James 4:13.

   But he says that he was hindered: you must take this in no other sense,
   but that the Lord employed him in more urgent concerns, which he could
   not have neglected without loss to the Church. Thus the hinderances of
   the godly and of the unbelieving differ: the latter perceive only that
   they are hindered, when they are restrained by the strong hand of the
   Lord, so as not to be able to move; but the former are satisfied with
   an hinderance that arises from some approved reason; nor do they allow
   themselves to attempt any thing beyond their duty, or contrary to
   edification.

   That I might obtain some fruit, etc. He no doubt speaks of that fruit,
   for the gathering of which the Lord sent his Apostles,

   "I have chosen you, that ye may go and bring forth fruit,
   and that your fruit may remain." (John 15:16.)

   Though he gathered it not for himself, but for the Lord, he yet calls
   it his own; for the godly have nothing more as their own than the work
   of promoting the glory of the Lord, with which is connected all their
   happiness. And he records what had happened to him with respect to
   other nations, that the Romans might entertain hope, that his coming to
   them would not be unprofitable, which so many nations had found to have
   been attended with so much benefit.

   14. I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, etc. Those
   whom he means by the Greeks and the Barbarians, he afterwards explains
   by adding, both to the wise and to the foolish; which words Erasmus has
   not rendered amiss by "learned and unlearned," (eruditos et rudes,) but
   I prefer to retain the very words of Paul. He then takes an argument
   from his own office, and intimates that it ought not to be ascribed to
   his arrogance, that he thought himself in a manner capable of teaching
   the Romans, however much they excelled in learning and wisdom and in
   the knowledge of things, inasmuch as it had pleased the Lord to make
   him a debtor even to the wise. [36]

   Two things are to be here considered -- that the gospel is by a
   heavenly mandate destined and offered to the wise, in order that the
   Lord may subject to himself all the wisdom of this world, and make all
   variety of talents, and every kind of science, and the loftiness of all
   arts, to give way to the simplicity of his doctrine; and what is more,
   they are to be reduced to the same rank with the unlearned, and to be
   made so meek, as to be able to bear those to be their fellow-disciples
   under their master, Christ, whom they would not have deigned before to
   take as their scholars; and then that the unlearned are by no means to
   be driven away from this school, nor are they to flee away from it
   through groundless fear; for if Paul was indebted to them, being a
   faithful debtor, he had doubtless discharged what he owed; and thus
   they will find here what they will be capable of enjoying. All teachers
   have also a rule here which they are to follow, and that is, modestly
   and kindly to accommodate themselves to the capacities of the ignorant
   and unlearned. Hence it will be, that they will be able, with more
   evenness of mind, to bear with many absurdities and almost innumerable
   things that may disgust them, by which they might otherwise be
   overcome. They are, however, to remember, that they are not so indebted
   to the foolish, as that they are to cherish their folly by immoderate
   indulgence.

   15. I am therefore ready, [37] etc. He concludes what he had before
   said of his desire -- that as he knew it to be his duty to spread the
   gospel among them, in order to gather fruit for the Lord, he was
   anxious to fulfill God's calling, as far as he was allowed to do so by
   the Lord.

   [36] Chalmers paraphrases the text thus -- "I am bound, or I am under
   obligation, laid upon me by the duties of my office, to preach both to
   Greeks and Barbarians, both to the wise and the unwise." In modern
   phraseology, the words may be rendered, "Both to the civilized and to
   the uncivilized, both to the learned and to the unlearned, am I a
   debtor." The two last terms are not exactly parallel to the two first,
   as many unlearned were among the Greeks, or the civilized, as well as
   among the Barbarians. -- Ed.

   [37] to kat eme prothumon, literally, "As to me there is readiness;"
   or, according to Stuart "There is a readiness so far as it respects
   me." But, "I am ready," or "I am prepared," conveys the meaning
   sufficiently, without the other words, "As much as in me is." By saying
   that he was prepared, he intimates that the event depended on another,
   even on God. -- Ed.

   Romans 1:16-17

   16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power
   of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first,
   and also to the Greek.

   16. Non enim pudet me Evangelii Christi, quandoquidem potentia est Dei,
   in salutem omni credenti, Iud����oprimum, deinde Gr����co.

   17. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
   faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

   17. Nam justitia Dei in eo revelatur ex fide in fidem, sicut scriptum
   est, Justus ex fide sua vivet.

   16. I am not indeed ashamed, etc. This is an anticipation of an
   objection; for he declares beforehand, that he cared not for the taunts
   of the ungodly; and he thus provides a way for himself, by which he
   proceeds to pronounce an eulogy on the value of the gospel, that it
   might not appear contemptible to the Romans. He indeed intimates that
   it was contemptible in the eyes of the world; and he does this by
   saying, that he was not ashamed of it. And thus he prepares them for
   bearing the reproach of the cross of Christ, lest they should esteem
   the gospel of less value by finding it exposed to the scoffs and
   reproaches of the ungodly; and, on the other hand, he shows how
   valuable it was to the faithful. If, in the first place, the power of
   God ought to be extolled by us, that power shines forth in the gospel;
   if, again, the goodness of God deserves to be sought and loved by us,
   the gospel is a display of his goodness. It ought then to be reverenced
   and honored, since veneration is due to God's power; and as it avails
   to our salvation, it ought to be loved by us.

   But observe how much Paul ascribes to the ministry of the word, when he
   testifies that God thereby puts forth his power to save; for he speaks
   not here of any secret revelation, but of vocal preaching. It hence
   follows, that those as it were willfully despise the power of God, and
   drive away from them his delivering hand, who withdraw themselves from
   the hearing of the word.

   At the same time, as he works not effectually in all, but only where
   the Spirit, the inward Teacher, illuminates the heart, he subjoins, To
   every one who believeth. The gospel is indeed offered to all for their
   salvation, but the power of it appears not everywhere: and that it is
   the savor of death to the ungodly, does not proceed from what it is,
   but from their own wickedness. By setting forth but one Salvation he
   cuts off every other trust. When men withdraw themselves from this one
   salvation, they find in the gospel a sure proof of their own ruin.
   Since then the gospel invites all to partake of salvation without any
   difference, it is rightly called the doctrine of salvation: for Christ
   is there offered, whose peculiar office is to save that which was lost;
   and those who refuse to be saved by him, shall find him a Judge. But
   everywhere in Scripture the word salvation is simply set in opposition
   to the word destruction: and hence we must observe, when it is
   mentioned, what the subject of the discourse is. Since then the gospel
   delivers from ruin and the curse of endless death, its salvation is
   eternal life. [38]

   First to the Jew and then to the Greek. Under the word Greek, he
   includes all the Gentiles, as it is evident from the comparison that is
   made; for the two clauses comprehend all mankind. And it is probable
   that he chose especially this nation to designate other nations,
   because, in the first place, it was admitted, next to the Jews, into a
   participation of the gospel covenant; and, secondly, because the
   Greeks, on account of their vicinity, and the celebrity of their
   language, were more known to the Jews. It is then a mode of speaking, a
   part being taken for the whole, by which he connects the Gentiles
   universally with the Jews, as participators of the gospel: nor does he
   thrust the Jews from their own eminence and dignity, since they were
   the first partakers of God's promise and calling. He then reserves for
   them their prerogative; but he immediately joins the Gentiles, though
   in the second place, as being partakers with them.

   17. For [39] the righteousness of God, etc. This is an explanation and
   a confirmation of the preceding clause -- that the gospel is the power
   of God unto salvation. For if we seek salvation, that is, life with
   God, righteousness must be first sought, by which being reconciled to
   him, we may, through him being propitious to us, obtain that life which
   consists only in his favor; for, in order to be loved by God, we must
   first become righteous, since he regards unrighteousness with hatred.
   He therefore intimates, that we cannot obtain salvation otherwise than
   from the gospel, since nowhere else does God reveal to us his
   righteousness, which alone delivers us from perdition. Now this
   righteousness, which is the groundwork of our salvation, is revealed in
   the gospel: hence the gospel is said to be the power of God unto
   salvation. Thus he reasons from the cause to the effect.

   Notice further, how extraordinary and valuable a treasure does God
   bestow on us through the gospel, even the communication of his own
   righteousness. I take the righteousness of God to mean, that which is
   approved before his tribunal; [40] as that, on the contrary, is usually
   called the righteousness of men, which is by men counted and supposed
   to be righteousness, though it be only vapor. Paul, however, I doubt
   not, alludes to the many prophecies in which the Spirit makes known
   everywhere the righteousness of God in the future kingdom of Christ.

   Some explain it as the righteousness which is freely given us by God:
   and I indeed confess that the words will bear this sense; for God
   justifies us by the gospel, and thus saves us: yet the former view
   seems to me more suitable, though it is not what I make much of. Of
   greater moment is what some think, that this righteousness does not
   only consist in the free remission of sins, but also, in part, includes
   the grace of regeneration. But I consider, that we are restored to life
   because God freely reconciles us to himself, as we shall hereafter show
   in its proper place.

   But instead of the expression he used before, "to every one who
   believeth," he says now, from faith; for righteousness is offered by
   the gospel, and is received by faith. And he adds, to faith: for as our
   faith makes progress, and as it advances in knowledge, so the
   righteousness of God increases in us at the same time, and the
   possession of it is in a manner confirmed. When at first we taste the
   gospel, we indeed see God's smiling countenance turned towards us, but
   at a distance: the more the knowledge of true religion grows in us, by
   coming as it were nearer, we behold God's favor more clearly and more
   familiarly. What some think, that there is here an implied comparison
   between the Old and New Testament, is more refined than well-founded;
   for Paul does not here compare the Fathers who lived under the law with
   us, but points out the daily progress that is made by every one of the
   faithful.

   As it is written, etc. By the authority of the Prophet Habakkuk he
   proves the righteousness of faith; for he, predicting the overthrow of
   the proud, adds this -- that the life of the righteous consists in
   faith. Now we live not before God, except through righteousness: it
   then follows, that our righteousness is obtained by faith; and the verb
   being future, designates the real perpetuity of that life of which he
   speaks; as though he had said, -- that it would not be momentary, but
   continue forever. For even the ungodly swell with the false notion of
   having life; but when they say, "Peace and safety," a sudden
   destruction comes upon them, (1 Thessalonians 5:3.) It is therefore a
   shadow, which endures only for a moment. Faith alone is that which
   secures the perpetuity of life; and whence is this, except that it
   leads us to God, and makes our life to depend on him? For Paul would
   not have aptly quoted this testimony had not the meaning of the Prophet
   been, that we then only stand, when by faith we recumb on God: and he
   has not certainly ascribed life to the faith of the godly, but in as
   far as they, having renounced the arrogance of the world, resign
   themselves to the protection of God alone. [41]

   He does not indeed professedly handle this subject; and hence he makes
   no mention of gratuitous justification: but it is sufficiently evident
   from the nature of faith, that this testimony is rightly applied to the
   present subject. Besides, we necessarily gather from his reasoning,
   that there is a mutual connection between faith and the gospel: for as
   the just is said to live by faith, he concludes that this life is
   received by the gospel.

   We have now the principal point or the main hinge of the first part of
   this Epistle, -- that we are justified by faith through the mercy of
   God alone. We have not this, indeed as yet distinctly expressed by
   Paul; but from his own words it will hereafter be made very clear --
   that the righteousness, which is grounded on faith, depends entirely on
   the mercy of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38] On the power of God, Pareus observes, that the abstract, after the
   Hebrew manner, is put for the concrete. Power means the instrument of
   God's power; that is, the gospel is an instrument rendered efficacious
   by divine power to convey salvation to believers: or, as Stuart says,
   "It is powerful through the energy which he imparts, and so it is
   called his power." Chalmers gives this paraphrase, "It is that, which
   however judged and despised as a weak instrument by the men of this
   world -- it is that, to which he, by his own power, gives effect for
   the recovery of that life which all men had forfeited and lost by sin."
   "The gospel is a divine act, which continues to operate through all
   ages of the world, and that not in the first place outwardly, but
   inwardly, in the depths of the soul, and for eternal purposes." -- Dr.
   Olshausen

   [39] "The causative, gar, indicates a connection with the preceding,
   that the gospel is the power of God: the reason is, because by the
   gospel is revealed the righteousness of God, that is, made known by it
   is a way of righteousness and of obtaining life before God, which
   neither the law, nor philosophy, nor any other doctrine, was able to
   show." -- Pareus

   [40] "The righteousness of God," dikaiosune theou, has been the
   occasion of much toil to critics, but without reason: the very context
   is sufficient to show its meaning, it being what the gospel reveals,
   and what the gospel reveals is abundantly known from other passages.
   Whether we saw, it is the righteousness which is approved of God, as
   Calvin says, or provided by God, or contrived by God, or imputed by
   God, the meaning does not materially differ, and indeed all these
   things, as it is evident from Scripture, are true respecting it. There
   is more difficulty connected with the following words, ek pisteos eis
   pistin. The view which Calvin gives was adopted by some of the Fathers,
   such as Theophylact and Clemens Alexandrinus; and it is that of
   Melancthon, Beza, Scaliger, Locke, and many others. From Poole we find
   that Chrysostom gave this exposition, "From the obscure and inchoate
   faith of the Old Testament to the clear and full faith of the New;" and
   that Ambrose's exposition was the following, "From the faith or
   fidelity of God who promises to the faith of him who believes." But in
   all these views there is not that which comports with the context, nor
   the construction very intelligible-"revealed from faith," What can it
   mean? To render the passage intelligibly, ek pisteos must be connected
   with dikaiosune theou, as suggested by Hammond, and followed by
   Doddridge and Macknight. Then it would be, "The righteousness of God by
   faith or, which is by faith:" this is revealed in the gospel "to
   faith," that is, in order that it may be believed; which is often the
   force of eis before a noun; as, eis ten anomian -- in order to do
   wickedness; or, eis hagiasmon in order to practice holiness, Romans
   6:19 Chalmers, Stuart, Barnes, and Haldane take this view. The verse
   may be thus rendered, -- For the righteousness of God by faith is in it
   revealed in order to be believed, as it is written, "The just shall by
   faith live." The same truth is conveyed in Romans 3:22; and similar
   phraseology is found in Philippians 3:9. Barnes seems fully to express
   the import of the passage in these words, "God's plan of justifying men
   is revealed in the gospel, which plan is by faith, and the benefits of
   which plan shall be extended to all that have faith or that believe."
   -- Ed.

   [41] Here is an instance in which Paul quotes the Old Testament,
   [Habbakuk 2:4] neither exactly from the Hebrew nor the Septuagint. The
   Hebrew is "the just, -- by his faith shall he live," vtsdyq v'mvntv
   hyh: and the Septuagint, turns "his" into "my," ho de dikaios ek
   pisteos mou zesetai -- "The just shall by my faith live," -- "by my
   faith," that is, according to the tenor of the passage, "by faith in
   me." The passage is quoted by him twice besides, in Galatians 3:11, and
   in Hebrews 10:38, but exactly in the same words, without the pronoun
   "his" or "my." His object in this, as in some similar instances, was to
   state the general truth contained in the passage, and not to give a
   strictly verbal quotation. -- Ed.

   Romans 1:18-23

   18. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
   unrighteousness;

   18. Revelatur enim ira Dei e coelo, super omnem impietatem et
   injustitiam hominum, veritatem Dei injuste continentium;

   19. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God
   hath shewed it unto them.

   19. Quia quod cognoscitur de Deo manifestum est in ipsis: Deus enim
   illis manifestavit.

   20. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
   clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
   eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

   20. Si quidem invisibilia ipsius, ex creatione mundi operibus
   intellecta, conspiciuntur, ����terna quoque ejus potentia, et divinitas;
   ut sint inexcusabiles.

   21. Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
   neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
   foolish heart was darkened.

   21. Quoniam quum Deum cogno vissent, non tanquam Deo gloriam dederunt,
   aut grati fuerunt; exinaniti sunt in cogitationibus suis, et
   obtenebratum est stultum coreorum.

   22. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

   22. Quum se putarent sapientes, stulti facti sunt,

   23. And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made
   like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and
   creeping things.

   23. Et mutaverunt gloriam incorruptibilis Dei similitudine imaginis
   corruptibilis hominis, et volucrum, et quadrupedum, et serpentum.

   18. For [42] revealed, etc. He reasons now by stating things of a
   contrary nature, and proves that there is no righteousness except what
   is conferred, or comes through the gospel; for he shows that without
   this all men are condemned: by it alone there is salvation to be found.
   And he brings, as the first proof of condemnation, the fact, -- that
   though the structure of the world, and the most beautiful arrangement
   of the elements, ought to have induced man to glorify God, yet no one
   discharged his proper duty: it hence appears that all were guilty of
   sacrilege, and of wicked and abominable ingratitude.

   To some it seems that this is a main subject, and that Paul forms his
   discourse for the purpose of enforcing repentance; but I think that the
   discussion of the subject begins here, and that the principal point is
   stated in a former proposition; for Paul's object was to teach us where
   salvation is to be found. He has already declared that we cannot obtain
   it except through the gospel: but as the flesh will not willingly
   humble itself so far as to assign the praise of salvation to the grace
   of God alone, Paul shows that the whole world is deserving of eternal
   death. It hence follows, that life is to be recovered in some other
   way, since we are all lost in ourselves. But the words, being well
   considered, will help us much to understand the meaning of the passage.

   Some make a difference between impiety and unrighteousness, and think,
   that by the former word is meant the profanation of God's worship, and
   by the latter, injustice towards men; but as the Apostle immediately
   refers this unrighteousness to the neglect of true religion, we shall
   explain both as referring to the same thing. [43] And then, all the
   impiety of men is to be taken, by a figure in language, as meaning "the
   impiety of all men," or, the impiety of which all men are guilty. But
   by these two words one thing is designated, and that is, ingratitude
   towards God; for we thereby offend in two ways: it is said to be
   asebeia, impiety, as it is a dishonoring of God; it is adikia,
   unrighteousness, because man, by transferring to himself what belongs
   to God, unjustly deprives God of his glory. The word wrath, according
   to the usage of Scripture, speaking after the manner of men, means the
   vengeance of God; for God, in punishing, has, according to our notion,
   the appearance of one in wrath. It imports, therefore, no such emotion
   in God, but only has a reference to the perception and feeling of the
   sinner who is punished. Then he says that it is revealed from heaven;
   though the expression, from heaven, is taken by some in the sense of an
   adjective, as though he had said "the wrath of the celestial God;" yet
   I think it more emphatical, when taken as having this import,
   "Wheresoever a man may look around him, he will find no salvation; for
   the wrath of God is poured out on the whole world, to the full extent
   of heaven."

   The truth of God means, the true knowledge of God; and to hold in that,
   is to suppress or to obscure it: hence they are charged as guilty of
   robbery. -- What we render unjustly, is given literally by Paul, in
   unrighteousness, which means the same thing in Hebrew: but we have
   regard to perspicuity. [44]

   19. Inasmuch as what may be known of God, etc. He thus designates what
   it behoves us to know of God; and he means all that appertains to the
   setting forth of the glory of the Lord, or, which is the same thing,
   whatever ought to move and excite us to glorify God. And by this
   expression he intimates, that God in his greatness can by no means be
   fully comprehended by us, and that there are certain limits within
   which men ought to confine themselves, inasmuch as God accommodates to
   our small capacities what he testifies of himself. Insane then are all
   they who seek to know of themselves what God is: for the Spirit, the
   teacher of perfect wisdom, does not in vain invite our attention to
   what may be known, to gnoston; and by what means this is known, he
   immediately explains. And he said, in them rather than to them, for the
   sake of greater emphasis: for though the Apostle adopts everywhere
   Hebrew phrases, and v, beth, is often redundant in that language, yet
   he seems here to have intended to indicate a manifestation, by which
   they might be so closely pressed, that they could not evade; for every
   one of us undoubtedly finds it to be engraven on his own heart, [45] By
   saying, that God has made it manifest, he means, that man was created
   to be a spectator of this formed world, and that eyes were given him,
   that he might, by looking on so beautiful a picture, be led up to the
   Author himself.

   20. Since his invisible things, [46] etc. God is in himself invisible;
   but as his majesty shines forth in his works and in his creatures
   everywhere, men ought in these to acknowledge him, for they clearly set
   forth their Maker: and for this reason the Apostle in his Epistle to
   the Hebrews says, that this world is a mirror, or the representation of
   invisible things. He does not mention all the particulars which may be
   thought to belong to God; but he states, that we can arrive at the
   knowledge of his eternal power and divinity; [47] for he who is the
   framer of all things, must necessarily be without beginning and from
   himself. When we arrive at this point, the divinity becomes known to
   us, which cannot exist except accompanied with all the attributes of a
   God, since they are all included under that idea.

   So that they are inexcusable. It hence clearly appears what the
   consequence is of having this evidence -- that men cannot allege any
   thing before God's tribunal for the purpose of showing that they are
   not justly condemned. Yet let this difference be remembered, that the
   manifestation of God, by which he makes his glory known in his
   creation, is, with regard to the light itself, sufficiently clear; but
   that on account of our blindness, it is not found to be sufficient. We
   are not however so blind, that we can plead our ignorance as an excuse
   for our perverseness. We conceive that there is a Deity; and then we
   conclude, that whoever he may be, he ought to be worshipped: but our
   reason here fails, because it cannot ascertain who or what sort of
   being God is. Hence the Apostle in Hebrews 11:3, ascribes to faith the
   light by which man can gain real knowledge from the work of creation,
   and not without reason; for we are prevented by our blindness, so that
   we reach not to the end in view; we yet see so far, that we cannot
   pretend any excuse. Both these things are strikingly set forth by Paul
   in Acts 14:16-17, when he says, that the Lord in past times left the
   nations in their ignorance, and yet that he left them not without
   witness (amarturon,) since he gave them rain and fertility from heaven.
   But this knowledge of God, which avails only to take away excuse,
   differs greatly from that which brings salvation, which Christ mentions
   in John 17:3, and in which we are to glory, as Jeremiah teaches us,
   Jeremiah 9:24

   21. For when they knew God, etc. He plainly testifies here, that God
   has presented to the minds of all the means of knowing him, having so
   manifested himself by his works, that they must necessarily see what of
   themselves they seek not to know -- that there is some God; for the
   world does not by chance exist, nor could it have proceeded from
   itself. But we must ever bear in mind the degree of knowledge in which
   they continued; and this appears from what follows.

   They glorified him not as God. No idea can be formed of God without
   including his eternity, power, wisdom, goodness, truth, righteousness,
   and mercy. His eternity appears evident, because he is the maker of all
   things -- his power, because he holds all things in his hand and
   continues their existence -- his wisdom, because he has arranged things
   in such an exquisite order -- his goodness, for there is no other cause
   than himself, why he created all things, and no other reason, why he
   should be induced to preserve them -- his justice, because in his
   government he punishes the guilty and defends the innocent -- his
   mercy, because he bears with so much forbearance the perversity of men
   -- and his truth, because he is unchangeable. He then who has a right
   notion of God ought to give him the praise due to his eternity, wisdom,
   goodness, and justice. Since men have not recognized these attributes
   in God, but have dreamt of him as though he were an empty phantom, they
   are justly said to have impiously robbed him of his own glory. Nor is
   it without reason that he adds, that they were not thankful, [48] for
   there is no one who is not indebted to him for numberless benefits:
   yea, even on this account alone, because he has been pleased to reveal
   himself to us, he has abundantly made us indebted to him. But they
   became vain, [49] etc.; that is, having forsaken the truth of God, they
   turned to the vanity of their own reason, all the acuteness of which is
   fading and passes away like vapor. And thus their foolish mind, being
   involved in darkness, could understand nothing aright but was carried
   away headlong, in various ways, into errors and delusions. Their
   unrighteousness was this -- they quickly choked by their own depravity
   the seed of right knowledge, before it grew up to ripeness.

   22. While they were thinking, etc. It is commonly inferred from this
   passage, that Paul alludes here to those philosophers, who assumed to
   themselves in a peculiar manner the reputation of wisdom; and it is
   thought that the design of his discourse is to show, that when the
   superiority of the great is brought down to nothing, the common people
   would have no reason to suppose that they had any thing worthy of being
   commended: but they seem to me to have been guided by too slender a
   reason; for it was not peculiar to the philosophers to suppose
   themselves wise in the knowledge of God, but it was equally common to
   all nations, and to all ranks of men. There were indeed none who sought
   not to form some ideas of the majesty of God, and to make him such a
   God as they could conceive him to be according to their own reason.
   This presumption I hold is not learned in the schools, but is innate,
   and comes with us, so to speak, from the womb. It is indeed evident,
   that it is an evil which has prevailed in all ages -- that men have
   allowed themselves every liberty in coining superstitions. The
   arrogance then which is condemned here is this -- that men sought to be
   of themselves wise, and to draw God down to a level with their own low
   condition, when they ought humbly to have given him his own glory. For
   Paul holds this principle, that none, except through their own fault,
   are unacquainted with the worship due to God; as though he said, "As
   they have proudly exalted themselves, they have become infatuated
   through the righteous judgment of God." There is an obvious reason,
   which contravenes the interpretation which I reject; for the error of
   forming an image of God did not originate with the philosophers; but
   they, by their consent, approved of it as received from others. [50]

   23. And changed, etc. Having feigned such a God as they could
   comprehend according to their carnal reason, they were very far from
   acknowledging the true God: but devised a fictitious and a new god, or
   rather a phantom. And what he says is, that they changed the glory of
   God; for as though one substituted a strange child, so they departed
   from the true God. Nor are they to be excused for this pretense, that
   they believe that God dwells in heaven, and that they count not the
   wood to be God, but his image; for it is a high indignity to God, to
   form so gross an idea of his majesty as to dare to make an image of
   him. But from the wickedness of such a presumption none were exempt,
   neither priests, nor statesmen, nor philosophers, of whom the most
   sound-minded, even Plato himself, sought to find out some likeness of
   God.

   The madness then here noticed, is, that all attempted to make for
   themselves an image of God; which was a certain proof that their
   notions of God were gross and absurd. And, first, they befouled the
   majesty of God by forming him in the likeness of a corruptible man: for
   I prefer this rendering to that of mortal man, which is adopted by
   Erasmus; for Paul sets not the immortality of God in opposition to the
   mortality of man, but that glory, which is subject to no defects, to
   the most wretched condition of man. And then, being not satisfied with
   so great a crime, they descended even to beasts and to those of the
   most filthy kind; by which their stupidity appeared still more evident.
   You may see an account of these abominations in Lactantius, in
   Eusebius, and in Augustine in his book on the city of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] The connection here is not deemed very clear. Stuart thinks that
   this verse is connected, as the former one, with Romans 1:16. and that
   it includes a reason why the Apostle was not ashamed of the gospel: and
   Macknight seems to have been of the same opinion, for he renders gar,
   besides. In this case the revelation of wrath from heaven is that which
   is made by the gospel. This certainly gives a meaning to the words,
   "from heaven" which is hardly done by any other views. That the gospel
   reveals "wrath," as well as righteousness to be obtained by faith, is
   what is undeniable. Salvation to the believer, and condemnation to the
   unbeliever, is its sum and substance. The objection made by Haldane is
   of no force, -- that the Apostle subsequently shows the sins of mankind
   as committed against the light of nature, and not against the gospel;
   for he seems to have brought forward the evidence from the light of
   nature, in order to confirm the evidence from the light of revelation.
   The expression is, "Revealed is the wrath of God," and not has been.
   See Acts 17:30, 31 This is the view taken by Turrettin; and Pareus
   says, "There is nothing to prevent us from referring the revelation of
   wrath, as well as the revelation of righteousness, to the gospel" --
   Ed.

   [43] It is true that the immediate subject is the neglect of religion;
   but then injustice towards men is afterwards introduced, and most
   critics take it in this sense. -- Ed.

   [44] This clause, ton ten aletheian en adikia katechonton is
   differently rendered, "Veritatem injuste detinentes -- unjustly
   detaining the truth," Turrettin; "Who stifle the truth in
   unrighteousness," Chalmers; "Who hinder the truth by unrighteousness,"
   Stuart; "Who wickedly oppose the truth," Hodge; "Who confine the truth
   by unrighteousness," Macknight "They rushed headlong," says Pareus,
   "into impiety against God and into injustice against one another, not
   through ignorance, but knowingly, not through weakness, but willfully
   and maliciously: and this the Apostle expresses by a striking metaphor,
   taken from tyrants, who, against right and justice, by open violence,
   oppress the innocent, bind them in chains, and detain them in prison."
   The sense given by Schleusner and some others, "Qui cum veri Dei
   cognitione pravitatem vit���� conjungunt -- who connect with a knowledge
   of the true God a wicked life," seems not to comport with the context.
   "The truth" means that respecting the being and power of God afterwards
   specified. -- Ed.

   [45] Some take en autois, to mean among them, i.e., as Stuart says, "in
   the midst of them, or before their eyes," that is, in the visible
   world; though many refer it with Calvin, to the moral sense, and that
   the expression is the same with "written in their hearts," in Romans
   2:15. -- Ed.

   [46] There is a passage quoted by Wolfius from Aristotle in his book De
   Mundo, which remarkably coincides with a part of this verse -- "pasHu
   thnetho phusei genomenos atheoretos ap auton ton ergon theoreitai ho
   theos -- God, unseen by any mortal nature, is to be seen by the works
   themselves." -- Ed.

   [47] Divinitas, theiotes, here only, and not theotes as in Colossians
   1:9 Elsner and others make a difference between these two words and
   say, that the former means the divinity or majesty of God, and the
   latter his nature or being. There seems to be the idea of goodness
   conveyed in the word, theiotes: for in the following verse there are
   two things laid to the charge of the Gentiles which bear a reference to
   the two things said here -- they did not glorify him as God, and they
   were not thankful. He made himself known by power as God, and by the
   beneficent exercise of that power, he had laid a claim to the gratitude
   of his creatures. See Acts 14:15; and Acts 17:25, 27 Venema, in his
   note on this passage, shows, that goodness was regarded by many of the
   heathens as the primary attribute of Deity. Among the Greeks, goodness
   -- to agathon, was the expression by which the Supreme Being was
   distinguished. And it appears evident from the context that the Apostle
   included this idea especially in the word theiotes. -- Ed

   [48] The conjunctive, e, is for oute, says Piscator: but it is a
   Hebraism, for v is sometimes used in Hebrew without the negative, which
   belongs to a former clause. -- Ed.

   [49] The original words are, emataiothesan en tois dialogismois auton,
   "Vani facti sunt in ratiocinationibus suis -- they became vain in their
   reasonings" Pareus, Beza, Turrettin, and Doddridge; "They became
   foolish by their own reasonings," Macknight "Whatever the right reason
   within," says Pareus, "or the frame of the world without, might have
   suggested respecting God, they indulged in pleasing speculations,
   specious reasonings, and in subtle and frivolous conclusions; some
   denied the existence of a God, as Epicurus and Democritus -- others
   doubted, as Protagoras and Diagoras -- others affirmed the existence of
   many gods, and these, as the Platonics, maintained that they are not
   corporeal, while the Greeks and Romans held them to be so, who
   worshipped dead men, impious, cruel, impure, and wicked. There were
   also the Egyptians, who worshipped as gods, brute animals, oxen, geese,
   birds, crocodiles, yea, what grew in their gardens, garlic's and
   onions. A very few, such as Plato and Aristotle, acknowledged one
   Supreme Being; but even these deprived him of his providence. These,
   and the like, were the monstrous opinions which the Gentiles deduced
   from their reasonings. They became vain, foolish, senseless." "And
   darkened became their foolish heart," -- he asunetos auton kardia;
   "Corinthians eorum intelligentia carens -- their heart void of
   understanding;" "their unintelligent heart," Doddridge. Perhaps
   "undiscerning heart" would be the most suitable. See Matthew 15:16.
   Heart, after the manner of the Hebrews, is to be taken here for the
   whole soul, especially the mind. -- Ed.

   [50] Calvin is peculiar in his exposition of this verse. Most critics
   agree in thinking that those referred to here were those reputed
   learned among all nations, as Beza says, "Such as the Druids of the
   Gauls, the soothsayers of the Tuscans, the philosophers of the Greeks,
   the priests of the Egyptians, the magi of the Persians, the
   gymnosophists of the Indians, and the Rabbins of the Jews." He
   considers that the Apostle refers especially to such as these, though
   he speaks of all men as appearing to themselves very wise in their
   insane devices as to the worship of God. The wiser they thought
   themselves, the more foolish they became. See Jeremiah 8:8, 9; 1
   Corinthians 1:19-22. "This is the greatest unhappiness of man, not only
   not to feel his malady, but to extract matter of pride from what ought
   to be his shame. What they deemed to be their wisdom was truly their
   folly." -- Haldane. It is a just remark of Hodge, "That the higher the
   advancement of the nations in refinement and philosophy, the greater,
   as a general rule, the degradation and folly of their systems of
   religion." As a proof he mentions the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and
   Romans, as compared with the aborigines of America. -- Ed.

   Romans 1:24-32

   24. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of
   their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

   24. Propterea tradidit illos Deus in cupiditates cordium suorum in
   immunditiem, ut ignominia afficerent corpora sua in seipsis:

   25. Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served
   the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

   25. Qui transmutarunt veritatem ejus in mendacium et coluerunt ac
   venerati sunt creaturam supra, Creatorem, qui est benedictus in secula:
   Amen.

   26. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
   their women did change the natural use into that which is against
   nature:

   26. Propterea, inquam, tradidit illos Deus in passiones ignominiosas:
   ac enim femin���� ipsorum transmutarunt natura- lem usum in eum qui est
   pr����ter naturam:

   27. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
   burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that
   which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their
   error which was meet.

   27. Similiter et viri quoque, amisso naturali usu femin����, exarserunt
   mutua libidine, alii in alios; masculi in masculis foeditatem per
   petrantes et quam decebat erroris sui mercedem in seipsis recipientes.

   28. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God
   gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
   convenient;

   28. Et quemadmodum non probaverunt Deum habere in notitia, tradidit
   illos Deus in reprobam mentem, ad facienda qu���� non decerent;

   29. Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
   covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
   malignity; whisperers,

   29. Ut essent pleni omni injustitia, nequitia, libidine, avaritia,
   malitia; referti invidia, homicidio, contentione, dolo, perversitate;
   susurrones,

   30. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors
   of evil things, disobedient to parents,

   30. Obtrectatores, osores Dei, malefici, contumeliosi, fastuosi,
   repertores malorum, parentibus immorigeri,

   31. Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection,
   implacable, unmerciful:

   31. Intelligenti���� expertes, insociabiles, affectu humanitatis carentes,
   foedifragi, sine misericordi���� sensu;

   32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things
   are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them
   that do them.

   32. Qui, quum Dei judicium cognoverint, quod qui talia agunt, digni
   sunt morte, non tantum ea faciunt, sed assentiuntur facientibus.

   24. God therefore gave them up, etc. As impiety is a hidden evil, lest
   they should still find an evasion, he shows, by a more palpable
   demonstration, that, they cannot escape, but must be held fast by a
   just condemnation, since such fruits have followed this impiety as
   cannot be viewed otherwise than manifest evidences of the Lord's wrath.
   As the Lord's wrath is always just, it follows, that what has exposed
   them to condemnation, must have preceded it. By these evidences then he
   now proves the apostasy and defection of men: for the Lord indeed does
   so punish those, who alienate themselves from his goodness, that he
   casts them headlong into various courses which lead to perdition and
   ruin. And by comparing the vices, of which they were guilty, with the
   impiety, of which he had before accused them, he shows that they
   suffered punishment through the just judgment of God: for since nothing
   is dearer to us than our own honor, it is extreme blindness, when we
   fear not to bring disgrace on ourselves; and it is the most suitable
   punishment for a reproach done to the Divine Majesty. This is the very
   thing which he treats of to the end of the chapter; but he handles it
   in various ways, for the subject required ample illustration.

   What then, in short, he proves to us is this, -- that the ingratitude
   of men to God is incapable of being excused; for it is manifest, by
   unequivocal evidences, that the wrath of God rages against them: they
   would have never rolled themselves in lusts so filthy, after the manner
   of beasts, had not the majesty of God been provoked and incensed
   against them. Since, then, the worst abominations abounded everywhere,
   he concludes that there existed among them evidences of divine
   vengeance. Now, as this never rages without reason, or unjustly, but
   ever keeps within the limits of what is right, he intimates that it
   hence appears that perdition, not less certain than just, impended over
   all.

   As to the manner in which God gives up or delivers men to wickedness,
   it is by no means necessary in this place to discuss a question so
   intricate, (longam -- tedious.) It is indeed certain, that he not only
   permits men to fall into sin, by allowing them to do so, and by
   conniving at them; but that he also, by his equitable judgment, so
   arranges things, that they are led and carried into such madness by
   their own lusts, as well as by the devil. He therefore adopts the word,
   give up, according to the constant usage of Scripture; which word they
   forcibly wrest, who think that we are led into sin only by the
   permission of God: for as Satan is the minister of God's wrath, and as
   it were the executioner, so he is armed against us, not through the
   connivance, but by the command of his judge. God, however, is not on
   this account cruel, nor are we innocent, inasmuch as Paul plainly
   shows, that we are not delivered up into his power, except when we
   deserve such a punishment. Only we must make this exception, that the
   cause of sin is not from God, the roots of which ever abide in the
   sinner himself; for this must be true,

   "Thine is perdition, O Israel; in me only is thy help."
   (Hosea 13:9) [51]

   By connecting the desires or lusts of man's heart with uncleanness, he
   indirectly intimates what sort of progeny our heart generates, when
   left to itself. The expression, among themselves, is not without its
   force; for it significantly expresses how deep and indelible are the
   marks of infamy imprinted on our bodies.

   25. Who changed, etc. He repeats what he had said before, though in
   different words, in order to fix it deeper in our minds. When the truth
   of God is turned to a lie, his glory is obliterated. It is then but
   just, that they should be besprinkled with every kind of infamy, who
   strive to take away from God his honor, and also to reproach his name.
   --

   And worshipped, etc. That I might include two words in one, I have
   given this rendering. He points out especially the sin of idolatry; for
   religious honor cannot be given to a creature, without taking it away,
   in a disgraceful and sacrilegious manner, from God: and vain is the
   excuse that images are worshipped on God's account, since God
   acknowledges no such worship, nor regards it as acceptable; and the
   true God is not then worshipped at all, but a fictitious God, whom the
   flesh has devised for itself. [52] What is added, Who is blessed for
   ever, I explain as having been said for the purpose of exposing
   idolaters to greater reproach, and in this way, "He is one whom they
   ought alone to have honored and worshipped, and from whom it was not
   right to take away any thing, no, not even the least."

   26. God therefore gave them up, etc. After having introduced as it were
   an intervening clause, he returns to what he had before stated
   respecting the judgment of God: and he brings, as the first example,
   the dreadful crime of unnatural lust; and it hence appears that they
   not only abandoned themselves to beastly lusts, but became degraded
   beyond the beasts, since they reversed the whole order of nature. He
   then enumerates a long catalogue of vices which had existed in all
   ages, and then prevailed everywhere without any restraint.

   It is not to the purpose to say, that every one was not laden with so
   great a mass of vices; for in arraigning the common baseness of men, it
   is proof enough if all to a man are constrained to acknowledge some
   faults. So then we must consider, that Paul here records those
   abominations which had been common in all ages, and were at that time
   especially prevalent everywhere; for it is marvelous how common then
   was that filthiness which even brute beasts abhor; and some of these
   vices were even popular. And he recites a catalogue of vices, in some
   of which the whole race of man were involved; for though all were not
   murderers, or thieves, or adulterers, yet there were none who were not
   found polluted by some vice or another. He calls those disgraceful
   passions, which are shameful even in the estimation of men, and redound
   to the dishonoring of God.

   27. Such a reward for their error as was meet. They indeed deserved to
   be blinded, so as to forget themselves, and not to see any thing
   befitting them, who, through their own malignity, closed their eyes
   against the light offered them by God, that they might not behold his
   glory: in short, they who were not ashamed to extinguish, as much as
   they could, the glory of God, which alone gives us light, deserved to
   become blind at noonday.

   28. And as they chose not, etc. There is an evident comparison to be
   observed in these words, by which is strikingly set forth the just
   relation between sin and punishment. As they chose not to continue in
   the knowledge of God, which alone guides our minds to true wisdom, the
   Lord gave them a perverted mind, which can choose nothing that is
   right. [53] And by saying, that they chose not, (non probasse -
   approved not,) it is the same as though he had said, that they pursued
   not after the knowledge of God with the attention they ought to have
   done, but, on the contrary, turned away their thoughts resignedly from
   God. He then intimates, that they, making a depraved choice, preferred
   their own vanities to the true God; and thus the error, by which they
   were deceived, was voluntary.

   To do those things which were not meet As he had hitherto referred only
   to one instance of abomination, which prevailed indeed among many, but
   was not common to all, he begins here to enumerate vices from which
   none could be found free: for though every vice, as it has been said,
   did not appear in each individual, yet all were guilty of some vices,
   so that every one might separately be accused of manifest depravity. As
   he calls them in the first instance not meet, understand him as saying,
   that they were inconsistent with every decision of reason, and alien to
   the duties of men: for he mentions it as an evidence of a perverted
   mind, that men addicted themselves, without any reflection, to those
   vices, which common sense ought to have led them to renounce.

   But it is labor in vain so to connect these vices, as to make them
   dependent one on another, since this was not Paul's design; but he set
   them down as they occurred to his mind. What each of them signifies, we
   shall very briefly explain.

   29. Understand by unrighteousness, the violation of justice among men,
   by not rendering to each his due. I have rendered ponerian, according
   to the opinion of Ammonium, wickedness; for he teaches us that poneron,
   the wicked, is drastikon kakou, the doer of evil. The word (nequitia)
   then means practiced wickedness, or licentiousness in doing mischief:
   but maliciousness (malitia) is that depravity and obliquity of mind
   which leads us to do harm to our neighbour. [54] For the word porneian,
   which Paul uses, I have put lust, (libidinem.) I do not, however,
   object, if one prefers to render it fornication; but he means the
   inward passion as well as the outward act. [55] The words avarice,
   envy, and murder, have nothing doubtful in their meaning. Under the
   word strife, (contentione,) [56] he includes quarrels, fightings, and
   seditions. We have rendered kakoetheian, perversity, (perversitatem;)
   [57] which is a notorious and uncommon wickedness; that is, when a man,
   covered over, as it were, with hardness, has become hardened in a
   corrupt course of life by custom and evil habit.

   30. The word theostugeis, means, no doubt, haters of God; for there is
   no reason to take it in a passive sense, (hated of God,) since Paul
   here proves men to be guilty by manifest vices. Those, then, are
   designated, who hate God, whose justice they seem to resist by doing
   wrong. Whisperers (susurrones) and slanderers (obtrectatores) [58] are
   to be thus distinguished; the former, by secret accusations, break off
   the friendships of good men, inflame their minds with anger, defame the
   innocent, and sow discords; and the latter through an innate malignity,
   spare the reputation of no one, and, as though they were instigated by
   the fury of evilspeaking, they revile the deserving as well as the
   undeserving We have translated hubristas, villanous, (maleficos;) for
   the Latin authors are wont to call notable injuries villanies, such as
   plunders, thefts, burnings, and sorceries; and these where the vices
   which Paul meant to point out here. [59] I have rendered the word
   huperephanous, used by Paul, insolent, (contumeliosos;) for this is the
   meaning of the Greek word: and the reason for the word is this, --
   because such being raised, as it were, on high, look down on those who
   are, as it were, below them with contempt, and they cannot bear to look
   on their equals. Haughty are they who swell with the empty wind of
   overweeningness. Unsociable [60] are those who, by their iniquities,
   unloose the bands of society, or those in whom there is no sincerity or
   constancy of faith, who may be called truce-breakers.

   31. Without the feelings of humanity are they who have put off the
   first affections of nature towards their own relations. As he mentions
   the want of mercy as an evidence of human nature being depraved,
   Augustine, in arguing against the Stoics, concludes, that mercy is a
   Christian virtue.

   32. Who, knowing the judgement [61] of God, etc. Though this passage is
   variously explained, yet the following appears to me the correctest
   interpretation, -- that men left nothing undone for the purpose of
   giving unbridled liberty to their sinful propensities; for having taken
   away all distinction between good and evil, they approved in themselves
   and in others those things which they knew displeased God, and would be
   condemned by his righteous judgment. For it is the summit of all evils,
   when the sinner is so void of shame, that he is pleased with his own
   vices, and will not bear them to be reproved, and also cherishes them
   in others by his consent and approbation. This desperate wickedness is
   thus described in Scripture:

   "They boast when they do evil," (Proverbs 2:14.)

   "She has spread out her feet,
   and gloried in her wickedness," (Ezekiel 16:25.)

   For he who is ashamed is as yet healable; but when such an impudence is
   contracted through a sinful habit, that vices, and not virtues, please
   us, and are approved, there is no more any hope of reformation. Such,
   then, is the interpretation I give; for I see that the Apostle meant
   here to condemn something more grievous and more wicked than the very
   doing of vices: what that is I know not, except we refer to that which
   is the summit of all wickedness, -- that is, when wretched men, having
   cast away all shame, undertake the patronage of vices in opposition to
   the righteousness of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [51] On this subject Augustine, as quoted by Poole, uses a stronger
   language than which we find here: -- Tradidit non solum per patientiam
   et permissionem, sed per potentiam et quasi actionem; non faciendo
   voluntates malas, sed eis jam malis utendo ut voluerit; multa et intra
   ipsos et exrtra ipsos operando, a quibus illi occasionem capiunt
   gravius peccandi; largiendo illis admonitiones, flagella, beneficia,
   etc., quibus quoque eos scivit Deus ad suam perniciem abusuros -- "He
   delivered them up, not only by sufferance and permission, but by power,
   and as it were by an efficient operation; not by making evil their
   wills, but by using them, being already evil, as he pleased; by working
   many things both within and without them, from which they take occasion
   to sin more grievously, by giving them warnings, scourges, benefits,
   etc., which God knew they would abuse to their own destruction." --
   This is an awful view of God's proceedings towards those who willfully
   resist the truth, but no doubt a true one. Let all who have the
   opportunity of knowing the truth tremble at the thought of making light
   of it. The preposition en before desires or lusts, is used after the
   Hebrew manner, in the sense of to or into; for v beth, means in, and
   to, and also by or through; and such is the import of en as frequently
   used by the Apostle. It is so used in the preceding verse -- en
   homoiomati -- into the likeness, etc. Then the verse would be, as
   Calvin in sense renders it, -- God also on this account delivered them
   up to the lusts of their own hearts to work uncleanness, that they
   might dishonor their bodies among themselves. The import of eis
   akatharsian, in order to uncleanness, is no doubt, to work uncleanness;
   the Apostle frequently uses this kind of expression. Stuart labors here
   unnecessarily to show, that God gave them up, being in their lusts,
   etc., taking the clause as a description of those who were given up;
   but the plainest meaning is that which Calvin gives. -- Ed.

   [52] The words, "the truth of God," and "falsehood," or, a lie, are
   Hebraistic in their meaning, signifying "the true God," and "an idol."
   The word, which means a lie, is often in Hebrew applied to any thing
   made to be worshipped. See Isaiah 44:17, compared with 20; Jeremiah
   13:25 Stuart renders the sentence, "Who exchanged the true God for a
   false one." Wolfius objects to this view, and says, "I prefer to take
   aletheian tou theou, for the truth made known by God to the Gentiles,
   of which see Romans 1:18, and the following verses: they changed this
   into a lie, i.e., into those insane and absurd notions, into which they
   were led by their dialogismois -- reasonings, Romans 1:21." The
   expression -- para ton ktisanta has been rendered by Erasmus, "above
   the creator," by Luther, "rather than the Creator;" by Beza, "to the
   neglect of the Creator -- pr����terito conditore;" and by Grotius, "in the
   place of the Creator." The two last are more consonant with the general
   tenor of the context; for the persons here spoken of, according to the
   description given them, did not worship God at all; para is evidently
   used in the sense of exclusion and opposition para ton nomon --
   contrary to the law, Acts 18:13; para phusin -- contrary to nature,
   Romans 1: 26. See Galatians 1:8 -- Ed.

   [53] There is a correspondence between the words ouk edokimasan -- they
   did not approve, or think worthy, and adokimon -- unapproved, or
   worthless, which is connected with noun, mind. The verb means to try or
   prove a thing, as metal by fire, then to distinguish between what is
   genuine or otherwise, and also to approve of what is good and valuable.
   To approve or think fit or worthy seems to be the meaning here. Derived
   from this verb is adokimos, which is applied to unapproved or
   adulterated money, -- to men unsound, not able to bear the test, not
   genuine as Christians, 2 Corinthians 13:5, -- to the earth that is
   unfit to produce fruits, Hebrews 6:8. The nearest alliteration that can
   perhaps be presented is the following, "And as they did not deem it
   worth while to acknowledge God, God delivered them up to a worthless
   mind," that is, a mind unfit to discern between right and wrong. Beza
   gives this meaning, "Mentem omnis judicii expertem -- a mind void of
   all judgment." Locke's "unsearching mind," and Macknight's "unapproving
   mind," and Doddridge's "undiscerning mind," do not exactly convey the
   right idea, though the last comes nearest to it. It is an unattesting
   mind, not capable of bringing things to the test -- dokimion not able
   to distinguish between things of the most obvious nature. "To
   acknowledge God" is literally "to have God in recognition ton theon
   echein en epignosei." Venema says, that this is a purely Greek idiom,
   and adduces passages from Herodotus and Xenophon; from the first, the
   following phrase, en alogie echein -- to have in contempt, i.e., to
   contemn or despise. -- Ed.

   [54] The two words are poneria and kakia Doddridge renders them
   "mischief and malignity." Pareus says that kakia is vice, opposed to te
   arete -- virtue. -- Ed.

   [55] "Porneia has an extended sense, comprehending all illicit
   intercourse, whether fornication, adultery, incest, or any other venus
   illicita." --Stuart

   [56] Improperly rendered "debate" in our version -- eridos, "strife",
   by Macknight, and "contention," by Doddridge. -- Ed.

   [57] In our versions "malignity;" by Macknight, "bad disposition;" and
   by Doddridge, "inveteracy of evil habits." Schleusner thinks that it
   means here "malevolence." -- Ed.

   [58] Katalalous, literally gainsayers, or those who speak against
   others, -- defamers, calumniators; rendered "revilers," by Macknight.
   -- Ed.

   [59] The three words, hubistas huperephanous, and alazonas seem to
   designate three properties of a proud spirit -- disdainful or insolent,
   haughty and vainglorious. The hubristai are those who treat others
   petulantly, contumeliously, or insultingly "Insolent," as given by
   Macknight, is the most suitable word. The huperephanos is one who sets
   himself to view above others, the high and elevated, who exhibits
   himself as superior to others. The alazon is the boaster, who assumes
   more than what belongs to him, or promises more than what he can
   perform. These three forms of pride are often seen in the world. -- Ed.

   [60] Unsociabiles -- asunthetous. "Faithless," perhaps, would be the
   most suitable word. "Who adhere not to compacts," is the explanation of
   Hesychius To preserve the same negative according to what is done in
   Greek, we may render Romans 1:31 as follows: -- 31. Unintelligent,
   unfaithful, unnatural, unappeasable, unmerciful. -- Ed.

   [61] Calvin has "justitiam" here, though "judicium" is given in the
   text. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 2:1-2

   1. Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
   judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for
   thou that judgest doest the same things.

   1. Propterea inexcusabilis es, O homo, quicunque judicas: in quo enim
   judicas alterum, teipsum condemnas; eadem enim facis dum judicas.

   2. But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
   against them which commit such things.

   2. Novimus autem quod judicium Dei est secundum veritatem in eos qui
   talia agunt.

   1. Therefore inexcusable art thou, O man. This reproof is directed
   against hypocrites, who dazzle the eyes of men by displays of outward
   sanctity, and even think themselves to be accepted before God, as
   though they had given him full satisfaction. Hence Paul, after having
   stated the grosser vices, that he might prove that none are just before
   God, now attacks saintlings (sanctulos) of this kind, who could not
   have been included in the first catalogue. Now the inference is too
   simple and plain for any one to wonder how the Apostle derived his
   argument; for he makes them inexcusable, because they themselves knew
   the judgment of God, and yet transgressed the law; as though he said,
   "Though thou consented not to the vices of others, and seemest to be
   avowedly even an enemy and a reprover of vices; yet as thou art not
   free from them, if thou really examinest thyself, thou canst not bring
   forward any defense."

   For in what thou judgest another, etc. Besides the striking resemblance
   there is between the two Greek verbs, krinein and katakrinein (to judge
   and to condemn,) the enhancing of their sin ought to be noticed; for
   his mode of speaking is the same, as though he said, "Thou art doubly
   deserving of condemnation; for thou art guilty of the same vices which
   thou blamest and reprovest in others." It is, indeed, a well-known
   saying, -- that they who scrutinize the life of others lay claim
   themselves to innocence, temperance, and all virtues; and that those
   are not worthy of any indulgence who allow in themselves the same
   things which they undertake to correct in others.

   For thou, judging, doest the same things: so it is literally; but the
   meaning is, "Though thou judgest, thou yet doest the same things." And
   he says that they did them, because they were not in a right state of
   mind; for sin properly belongs to the mind. They then condemned
   themselves on this account, -- because, in reproving a thief, or an
   adulterer, or a slanderer, they did not merely condemn the persons, but
   those very vices which adhered to themselves. [62]

   2. But we know that the judgment of God, etc. The design of Paul is to
   shake off from hypocrites their self-complacencies, that they may not
   think that they can really gain any thing, though they be applauded by
   the world, and though they regard themselves guiltless; for a far
   different trial awaits them in heaven. But as he charges them with
   inward impurity, which, being hid from the eyes of men, cannot be
   proved and convicted by human testimonies, he summons them to the
   tribunal of God, to whom darkness itself is not hid, and by whose
   judgment the case of sinners, be they willing or unwilling, must be
   determined.

   Moreover, the truth of judgment will in two ways appear, because God
   will punish sin without any respect of persons, in whomsoever it will
   be found; and he will not heed outward appearances, nor be satisfied
   with any outward work, except what has proceeded from real sincerity of
   heart. It hence follows, that the mask of feigned sanctity will not
   prevent him from visiting secret wickedness with judgment. It is, no
   doubt, a Hebrew idiom; for truth in Hebrew means often the inward
   integrity of the heart, and thus stands opposed not only to gross
   falsehood, but also to the outward appearance of good works. And then
   only are hypocrites awakened, when they are told that God will take an
   account, not only of their disguised righteousness, but also of their
   secret motives and feelings. [63]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] It is confessed by most that the illative, dio, at the beginning
   of the verse can hardly be accounted for. The inference from the
   preceding is not very evident. It is, in my view, an instance of
   Hebraism; and the reference is not to what has preceded, but to what is
   to come. It is not properly an illative, but it anticipates a reason
   afterwards given, conveyed by for, or, because. Its meaning will be
   seen in the following version: -- On this account, inexcusable art
   thou, O man, whosoever thou be who condemnest another, because, in what
   thou condemnest another thou condemnest thyself; for thou who
   condemnest doest the same things. The verb, krino, has here the idea of
   condemning, or of passing judgments; to judge is not sufficiently
   distinct. -- Ed.

   [63] "According to truth" -- kata aletheian, means, according to the
   true state of the case, without any partiality, or according to what is
   just and equitable; so Grotius takes it. Its corresponding word in
   Hebrew, 'mt, is sometimes rendered dikaiosunm, It is found opposed to
   adikia in 1 Corinthians 13:6. The expression here may be deemed to be
   the same in meaning with dikaiokrisia -- righteous judgment, in verse
   5. -- Ed.

   Romans 2:3-10

   3. And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
   things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?

   3. Existimas autem, O homo, qui judicas eos qui talia faciunt, et eadem
   facis, quod ipse effugies judicium Dei?

   4. Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
   long-suffering; [64] not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee
   to repentance?

   4. An divitias bonitatis ipsius toleranti����que, ac lenitatis contemnis;
   ignorans quod bonitas Dei te ad poenitentiam deducit?

   5. But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto
   thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
   judgment of God;

   5. Sed, juxta duritiam tuam, et cor poenitere nescium, thesaurizas tibi
   iram in diem irae et revelations justi judicii Dei;

   6. Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

   6. Qui redditurus est unicuique secundam ipsius opera:

   7. To them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and
   honour and immortality, eternal life;

   7. Iis quidem, qui per boni operis perseverantiam, gloriam et honorem
   et immortalitatem qu����runt, vitam ����ternam;

   8. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but
   obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

   8. Iis vero qui sunt contentiosi, ac veritati immorigeri, injustiti����
   autem obtemperant, excandescentia, ira, tribulatio,

   9. Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of
   the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

   9. Et anxietas in omnem animam hominis perpetrantis malum, Iud����i primum
   simul et Gr����ci:

   10. But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to
   the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

   10. At gloria et honor et pax omni operanti bonum, Iud����o primum simul
   et Gr����co.

   3. And thinkest thou, O man, etc. As rhetoricians teach us, that we
   ought not to proceed to give strong reproof before the crime be proved,
   Paul may seem to some to have acted unwisely here for having passed so
   severe a censure, when he had not yet proved the accusation which he
   had brought forward. But the fact is otherwise; for he adduced not his
   accusation before men, but appealed to the judgment of conscience; and
   thus he deemed that proved which he had in view -- that they could not
   deny their iniquity, if they examined themselves and submitted to the
   scrutiny of God's tribunal. And it was not without urgent necessity,
   that he with so much sharpness and severity rebuked their fictitious
   sanctity; for men of this class will with astonishing security trust in
   themselves, except their vain confidence be forcibly shaken from them.
   Let us then remember, that this is the best mode of dealing with
   hypocrisy, in order to awaken it from its inebriety, that is, to draw
   it forth to the light of God's judgment.

   That thou shalt escape, etc. This argument is drawn from the less; for
   since our sins are subject to the judgment of men, much more are they
   to that of God, who is the only true Judge of all. Men are indeed led
   by a divine instinct to condemn evil deeds; but this is only an obscure
   and faint resemblance of the divine judgment. They are then extremely
   besotted, who think that they can escape the judgment of God, though
   they allow not others to escape their own judgment. It is not without
   an emphatical meaning that he repeats the word man; it is for the
   purpose of presenting a comparison between man and God.

   4. Dost thou despise the riches? etc. It does not seem to me, as some
   think, that there is here an argument, conclusive on two grounds,
   (dilemma,) but an anticipation of an objection: for as hypocrites are
   commonly transported with prosperity, as though they had merited the
   Lord's kindness by their good deeds, and become thus more hardened in
   their contempt of God, the Apostle anticipates their arrogance, and
   proves, by an argument taken from a reason of an opposite kind, that
   there is no ground for them to think that God, on account of their
   outward prosperity, is propitious to them, since the design of his
   benevolence is far different, and that is, to convert sinners to
   himself. Where then the fear of God does not rule, confidence, on
   account of prosperity, is a contempt and a mockery of his great
   goodness. It hence follows, that a heavier punishment will be inflicted
   on those whom God has in this life favored; because, in addition to
   their other wickedness, they have rejected the fatherly invitation of
   God. And though all the gifts of God are so many evidences of his
   paternal goodness, yet as he often has a different object in view, the
   ungodly absurdly congratulate themselves on their prosperity, as though
   they were dear to him, while he kindly and bountifully supports them.

   Not knowing that the goodness of God, etc. For the Lord by his kindness
   shows to us, that it is he to whom we ought turn, if we desire to
   secure our wellbeing, and at the same time he strengthens our
   confidence in expecting mercy. If we use not God's bounty for this end,
   we abuse it. But yet it is not to be viewed always in the same light;
   for when the Lord deals favorably with his servants and gives them
   earthly blessings, he makes known to them by symbols of this kind his
   own benevolence, and trains them up at the same time to seek the sum
   and substance of all good things in himself alone: when he treats the
   transgressors of his law with the same indulgence, his object is to
   soften by his kindness their perverseness; he yet does not testify that
   he is already propitious to them, but, on the contrary, invites them to
   repentance. But if any one brings this objection -- that the Lord sings
   to the deaf as long as he does not touch inwardly their hearts; we must
   answer -- that no fault can be found in this case except with our own
   depravity. But I prefer rendering the word which Paul here uses, leads,
   rather than invites, for it is more significant; I do not, however,
   take it in the sense of driving, but of leading as it were by the hand.

   5. But according to thy hardness, etc. When we become hardened against
   the admonitions of the Lord, impenitence follows; and they who are not
   anxious about repentance openly provoke the Lord. [65]

   This is a remarkable passage: we may hence learn what I have already
   referred to -- that the ungodly not only accumulate for themselves
   daily a heavier weight of God's judgments, as long as they live here,
   but that the gifts of God also, which they continually enjoy, shall
   increase their condemnation; for an account of them all will be
   required: and it will then be found, that it will be justly imputed to
   them as an extreme wickedness, that they had been made worse through
   God's bounty, by which they ought surely to have been improved. Let us
   then take heed, lest by unlawful use of blessings we lay up for
   ourselves this cursed treasure.

   For the day, etc.; literally, in the day; but it is put for eis
   hemeran, for the day. The ungodly gather now the indignation of God
   against themselves, the stream of which shall then be poured on their
   heads: they accumulate hidden destruction, which then shall be drawn
   out from the treasures of God. The day of the last judgment is called
   the day of wrath, when a reference is made to the ungodly; but it will
   be a day of redemption to the faithful. And thus all other visitations
   of God are ever described as dreadful and full of terror to the
   ungodly; and on the contrary, as pleasant and joyful to the godly.
   Hence whenever the Scripture mentions the approach of the Lord, it bids
   the godly to exult with joy; but when it turns to the reprobate, it
   proclaims nothing but dread and terror.

   "A day of wrath," saith Zephaniah, "shall be that day, a day of
   tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and wretchedness, a day of
   darkness and of thick darkness, a day of mist and of whirlwind."
   (Zephaniah 1:15.)

   You have a similar description in Joel 2:2, etc. And Amos exclaims,

   "Woe To You Who Desire The Day Of The Lord! What Will It Be To You? The
   Day Of The Lord Will Be Darkness, And Not Light." (Amos 5:18.)

   Farther, by adding the word revelation, Paul intimates what this day of
   wrath is to be, -- that the Lord will then manifest his judgment:
   though he gives daily some indications of it, he yet suspends and holds
   back, till that day, the clear and full manifestation of it; for the
   books shall then be opened; the sheep shall then be separated the
   goats, and the wheat shall be cleansed from the tares.

   6. Who will render to every one, etc. As he had to do with blind
   saintlings, who thought that the wickedness of their hearts was well
   covered, provided it was spread over with some disguises, I know not
   what, of empty works, he pointed out the true character of the
   righteousness of works, even that which is of account before God; and
   he did this, lest they should feel confident that it was enough to
   pacify him, if they brought words and trifles, or leaves only. But
   there is not so much difficulty in this verse, as it is commonly
   thought. For the Lord, by visiting the wickedness of the reprobate with
   just vengeance, will recompense them with what they have deserved: and
   as he sanctifies those whom he has previously resolved to glorify, he
   will also crown their good works, but not on account of any merit: nor
   can this be proved from this verse; for though it declares what reward
   good works are to have, it does yet by no means show what they are
   worth, or what price is due to them. And it is an absurd inference, to
   deduce merit from reward.

   7. To them indeed, who by perseverance, etc.; literally, patience; by
   which word something more is expressed. For it is perseverance, when
   one is not wearied in constantly doing good; but patience also is
   required in the saints, by which they may continue firm, though
   oppressed with various trials. For Satan suffers them not by a free
   course to come to the Lord; but he strives by numberless hinderances to
   impede them, and to turn them aside from the right way. And when he
   says, that the faithful, by continuing in good works, seek glory and
   honour, he does not mean that they aspire after any thing else but the
   favor of God, or that they strive to attain any thing higher, or more
   excellent: but they can not seek him, without striving, at the same
   time, for the blessedness of his kingdom, the description of which is
   contained in the paraphrase given in these words. The meaning then is,
   -- that the Lord will give eternal life to those who, by attention to
   good works, strive to attain immortality. [66]

   8. But to those who are contentious, etc. There is some irregularity in
   the passage; first, on account of its tenor being interrupted, for the
   thread of the discourse required, that the second clause of the
   contrast should be thus connected, -- "The Lord will render to them,
   who by perseverance in good works, seek glory, and honor, and
   immortality, eternal life; but to the contentious and the disobedient,
   eternal death." Then the conclusion might be joined, -- "That for the
   former are prepared glory, and honor, and incorruption; and that for
   the latter are laid up wrath and misery." There is another thing, --
   These words, indignation, wrath, tribulation, and anguish, are joined
   to two clauses in the context. However, the meaning of the passage is
   by no means obscure; and with this we must be satisfied in the
   Apostolic writings. From other writings must eloquence be learnt: here
   spiritual wisdom is to be sought, conveyed in a plain and simple style.
   [67]

   Contention is mentioned here for rebellion and stubbornness; for Paul
   was contending with hypocrites who, by their gross and supine
   self-indulgence, trifled with God. By the word truth, is simply meant
   the revealed will of God, which alone is the light of truth: for it is
   what belongs to all the ungodly, that they ever prefer to be in bondage
   to iniquity, rather than to receive the yoke of God; and whatever
   obedience they may pretend, yet they never cease perversely to clamor
   and struggle against God's word. For as they who are openly wicked
   scoff at the truth, so hypocrites fear not to set up in opposition to
   it their artificial modes of worship. The Apostle further adds, that
   such disobedient persons obey or serve iniquity; for there is no middle
   course, which those who are unwilling to be in subjection to the law of
   the Lord can take, so as to be kept from falling immediately into the
   service of sin. And it is the just reward of outrageous licentiousness,
   that those become the bondslaves of sin who cannot endure the service
   of God. Indignation and wrath, so the character of the words induces me
   to render them; for thumos in Greek means what the Latins call
   excandescentia -- indignation, as Cicero teaches us, (Tusc. 4,) even a
   sudden burning of anger. As to the other words I follow Erasmus. But
   observe, that of the four which are mentioned, the two last are, as it
   were, the effects of the two first; for they who perceive that God is
   displeased and angry with them are immediately filled with confusion.

   We may add, that though he might have briefly described, even in two
   words, the blessedness of the godly and also the misery of the
   reprobate, he yet enlarges on both subjects, and for this end -- that
   he might more effectually strike men with the fear of God's wrath, and
   sharpen their desire for obtaining grace through Christ: for we never
   fear God's judgment as we ought, except it be set as it were by a
   lively description before our eyes; nor do we really burn with desire
   for future life, except when roused by strong incentives, (multis
   flabellis incitati -- incited by many fans.)

   9. To the Jew first, etc. He simply places, I have no doubt, the Jew in
   opposition to the Gentile; for those whom he calls Greeks he will
   presently call Gentiles. But the Jews take the precedence in this case,
   for they had, in preference to others, both the promises and the
   threatenings of the law; as though he had said, "This is the universal
   rule of the divine judgment; it shall begin with the Jews, and it shall
   include the whole world."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [64] Lenitatis -- makrothumias, tarditatis ad iram. "Long-suffering"
   expresses the meaning very exactly. There is here a gradation --
   "goodness" -- chrestotes, benevolence, kindness, bounty; --
   "forbearance" -- anoche, withholding, i.e., of wrath; -- then
   "long-suffering," that is, bearing long with the sins of men. "Riches"
   mean abundance; the same as though the expression was, "the abounding
   goodness," etc. -- Ed.

   [65] What follows in the text, according to Calvin, is this, "et
   Corinthians poeni tere nescium -- and a heart that knoweth not to
   repent;" kai ametanoeton kardian, which Schleusner renders thus,
   "animus, qui omnem emendationem respuit -- a mind which rejects every
   improvement." It is an impenitable rather than "an impenitent heart,"
   that is, a heart incapable of repenting. See Ephesians 4:19. -- Ed.

   [66] It has appeared to some difficult to reconcile this language with
   the free salvation which the gospel offers, and to obviate the
   conclusion which many are disposed to draw from this passage -- that
   salvation is by works as well as by faith. To this objection Pareus
   answers, that the Apostle speaks here of salvation by the works of the
   law, not indeed as a thing possible, which he subsequently denies, but
   as a declaration of what it is, that he might thereby show the
   necessity of a gratuitous salvation which is by faith only. And this is
   the view which Mr. Haldane takes. But there is no need of having
   recourse to this hypothesis: for whenever judgment is spoken of even in
   the New Testament, it is ever represented in the same way, as being
   regulated in righteousness, according to the works of every individual.
   See Acts 17:31; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Colossians 3:24, 25; Revelation
   20:12; Revelation 22:12. It will be a judgment, conducted according to
   the perfect rule of justice, with no respect of persons, with no regard
   to individuals as such, whether high or low, much or little favored as
   to outward privileges, but according to what their conduct has been,
   under the circumstances of their case. The rule, if heathens, will be
   the law of nature; if Jews, the law which had been given them.
   Judgment, as to its character, will be still the same to those under
   the gospel; it will be according to what the gospel requires. -- Ed.

   [67] With regard to the construction of this passage, 6-10, it may be
   observed, that it is formed according to the mode of Hebrew
   parallelism, many instances of which we meet with even in the prose
   writings of the New Testament. None of the ancients, nor any of the
   moderns, before the time of Bishop Lowth, understood much of the
   peculiar character of the Hebrew style. All the anomalies, noticed by
   Calvin, instantly vanish, when the passage is so arranged, as to
   exhibit the correspondence of its different parts. It consists of two
   general portions; the first includes three verses, Romans 2:6, 7, and
   8; the other, the remaining three verses. The same things are mainly
   included in both portions, only in the latter there are some things
   additional, and explanatory, and the order is reversed, so that the
   passage ends with what corresponds with its beginning. To see the whole
   in a connected form, it is necessary to set it down in lines, in the
   following manner -- 6. Who will render to each according to his works,
   -- 7. To those indeed, who, by perseverance in well -- doing, Seek
   glory and honor and immortality, -- Eternal life 8. But there shall be
   to them who are contentious And obey not the truth, but obey iniquity,
   --Indignation and wrath: Then follow the same things, the order being
   reversed -- 9. Distress and anguish shall be on every soul of man that
   worketh evil, -- On the Jew first, and then on the Greek; 10. But glory
   and honor and peace, To every one who worketh good, -- To the Jew first
   and then to the Greek; 11. For there is no respect of persons with God.
   The idea in the last and the first line is essentially the same. This
   repetition is for the sake of producing an impression. The character of
   the righteous, in the first part, is, that by persevering in doing good
   they seek glory, honor, and immortality, and their reward is to be
   eternal life: the character of the wicked is that of being contentious,
   disobedient to the truth, and obedient to unrighteousness, and their
   reward is to be indignation and wrath. The character of the first, in
   the second part, is, that they work good; and of the other, that they
   work evil: and the reward of the first is glory, honor, and peace, and
   the reward of the other, distress and anguish; which are the effects of
   indignation and wrath, as glory honor, and peace are the fruits or the
   constituent parts of eternal life. It is to be observed that priority
   in happiness, as well as priority in misery, is ascribed to the Jew. --
   Ed.

   Romans 2:11-13

   11. For there is no respect of persons with God.

   11. Siquidem non est acceptio personarum apud Deum.

   12. For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
   law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;

   12. Quicunque enim sine Lege peccaverunt sine Lege etiam peribunt;
   quicunque vero in Lege peccaverunt per Legem judicabuntur.

   13. (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers
   of the law shall be justified.

   13. Non enim Legis auditores justi sunt apud Deum, sed qui Legem
   faciunt justificabuntur.

   11. There is no respect of persons, etc. He has hitherto generally
   arraigned all mortals as guilty; but now he begins to bring home his
   accusation to the Jews and to the Gentiles separately: and at the same
   time he teaches us, that it is no objection that there is a difference
   between them, but that they are both without any distinction exposed to
   eternal death. The Gentiles pretended ignorance as their defense; the
   Jews gloried in the honor of having the law: from the former he takes
   away their subterfuge, and he deprives the latter of their false and
   empty boasting.

   There is then a division of the whole human race into two classes; for
   God had separated the Jews from all the rest, but the condition of all
   the Gentiles was the same. He now teaches us, that this difference is
   no reason why both should not be involved in the same guilt. But the
   word person is taken in Scripture for all outward things, which are
   wont to be regarded as possessing any value or esteem. When therefore
   thou readest, that God is no respecter of persons, understand that what
   he regards is purity of heart or inward integrity; and that he hath no
   respect for those things which are wont to be highly valued by men,
   such as kindred, country, dignity, wealth, and similar things; so that
   respect of persons is to be here taken for the distinction or the
   difference there is between one nation and another. [68] But if any
   hence objects and says, "That then there is no such thing as the
   gratuitous election of God;" it may be answered, That there is a
   twofold acceptation of men before God; the first, when he chooses and
   calls us from nothing through gratuitous goodness, as there is nothing
   in our nature which can be approved by him; the second, when after
   having regenerated us, he confers on us his gifts, and shows favor to
   the image of his Son which he recognizes in us.

   12. Whosoever have sinned without law, [69] etc. In the former part of
   this section he assails the Gentiles; though no Moses was given them to
   publish and to ratify a law from the Lord, he yet denies this omission
   to be a reason why they deserved not the just sentence of death for
   their sins; as though he had said -- that the knowledge of a written
   law was not necessary for the just condemnation of a sinner. See then
   what kind of advocacy they undertake, who through misplaced mercy,
   attempt, on the ground of ignorance, to exempt the nations who have not
   the light of the gospel from the judgment of God.

   Whosoever have sinned under the law, etc. As the Gentiles, being led by
   the errors of their own reason, go headlong into ruin, so the Jews
   possess a law by which they are condemned; [70] for this sentence has
   been long ago pronounced,

   "Cursed are all they who continue not in all its precepts."
   (Deuteronomy 27:26.)

   A worse condition then awaits the Jewish sinners, since their
   condemnation is already pronounced in their own law.

   13. For the hearers of the law, etc. This anticipates an objection
   which the Jews might have adduced. As they had heard that the law was
   the rule of righteousness, (Deuteronomy 4:1,) they gloried in the mere
   knowledge of it: to obviate this mistake, he declares that the hearing
   of the law or any knowledge of it is of no such consequence, that any
   one should on that account lay claim to righteousness, but that works
   must be produced, according to this saying, "He who will do these shall
   live in them." The import then of this verse is the following, -- "That
   if righteousness be sought from the law, the law must be fulfilled; for
   the righteousness of the law consists in the perfection of works." They
   who pervert this passage for the purpose of building up justification
   by works, deserve most fully to be laughed at even by children. It is
   therefore improper and beyond what is needful, to introduce here a long
   discussion on the subject, with the view of exposing so futile a
   sophistry: for the Apostle only urges here on the Jews what he had
   mentioned, the decision of the law, -- That by the law they could not
   be justified, except they fulfilled the law, that if they transgressed
   it, a curse was instantly pronounced on them. Now we do not deny but
   that perfect righteousness is prescribed in the law: but as all are
   convicted of transgression, we say that another righteousness must be
   sought. Still more, we can prove from this passage that no one is
   justified by works; for if they alone are justified by the law who
   fulfill the law, it follows that no one is justified; for no one can be
   found who can boast of having fulfilled the law. [71]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] The word prosopolepsia, respect of persons, is found in three
   other places, Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 3:25; and James 2:1; and in
   these the reference is to conditions in life. In Acts 10:34, the word
   is in another form prosopoleptes, a respecter of persons, and as a verb
   in James 2:9. The full phrase is prosopon lambano, as found in Luke
   20:21, and Galatians 2:6. It is a phrase peculiar to the Hebrew
   language, and means literally, to lift up or regard faces, that is,
   persons, ns' phnym. See Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 10:17; 2
   Chronicles 19:7 An argument has been hence taken to oppose the doctrine
   of election; but this is to apply to a particular thing what belongs
   entirely and exclusively to another. This belongs to the administration
   of justice, but election is the exercise of mercy. Even Grotius admits,
   that God manifests a difference in bestowing benefits, but not in
   exercising Judgment. Indeed, in the present instance, with regard to
   the subject handled by the Apostle, there was a manifest difference;
   the Gentile had only the law of nature, but the Jew had a revealed law.
   Yet when brought to judgment there was to be no respect of persons,
   each was to be judged impartially according to the circumstances of his
   condition. And further, election does not proceed on the principle of
   showing respect of persons, that is, of regarding men according to
   their privileges or outward circumstances, or kindred or relation in
   life, or any thing in man; but its sole and exclusive ground or reason
   is the good pleasure of God. -- Ed.

   [69] Anomos commonly means unlawfully, wickedly, lawlessly; but here,
   as it is evident from the context, it signifies to be without law. The
   adjective anomos is also used once in this sense in 1 Corinthians 9:21.
   -- Ed.

   [70] The word "condemned" would be better in the text than "judged;" it
   would then more plainly correspond with the former part, where the word
   "perished" is used: and that it means "condemned" is evident, for those
   who have "sinned" are the persons referred to. -- Ed.

   [71] On the expression "hearers of the law," Stuart has these remarks
   -- "The Apostle here speaks of hoi akroatai tou nomou, because the Jews
   were accustomed to hear the Scriptures read in public; but many of them
   did not individually possess copies of the sacred volume which they
   could read."

   Romans 2:14-16

   14. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
   things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
   themselves:

   14. Quum enim Gentes, qu���� Legem non habent, natura qu���� Legis sunt
   faciant, ips����, Legem non habentes, sibi ips���� sunt Lex:

   15. Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
   conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while
   accusing or else excusing one another;)

   15. Qu���� ostendunt opus Legis scriptum in cordibus suis, simul
   attestante ipsorum conscientia et cogitationibus inter se accusantibus
   aut etiam excusantibus,

   16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
   according to my gospel.

   16. In die qua judicabit Deus occulta hominum, secundum Evangelium
   meum, per Iesum Christum.

   14. For when the Gentiles, etc. He now states what proves the former
   clause; for he did not think it enough to condemn us by mere assertion,
   and only to pronounce on us the just judgment of God; but he proceeds
   to prove this by reasons, in order to excite us to a greater desire for
   Christ, and to a greater love towards him. He indeed shows that
   ignorance is in vain pretended as an excuse by the Gentiles, since they
   prove by their own deeds that they have some rule of righteousness: for
   there is no nation so lost to every thing human, that it does not keep
   within the limits of some laws. Since then all nations, of themselves
   and without a monitor, are disposed to make laws for themselves, it is
   beyond all question evident that they have some notions of justice and
   rectitude, which the Greeks call preconceptions prolepseis, and which
   are implanted by nature in the hearts of men. They have then a law,
   though they are without law: for though they have not a written law,
   they are yet by no means wholly destitute of the knowledge of what is
   right and just; as they could not otherwise distinguish between vice
   and virtue; the first of which they restrain by punishment, and the
   latter they commend, and manifest their approbation of it by honoring
   it with rewards. He sets nature in opposition to a written law, meaning
   that the Gentiles had the natural light of righteousness, which
   supplied the place of that law by which the Jews were instructed, so
   that they were a law to themselves. [72]

   15. Who show the work of the law [73] written, etc.; that is, they
   prove that there is imprinted on their hearts a discrimination and
   judgment by which they distinguish between what is just and unjust,
   between what is honest and dishonest. He means not that it was so
   engraven on their will, that they sought and diligently pursued it, but
   that they were so mastered by the power of truth, that they could not
   disapprove of it. For why did they institute religious rites, except
   that they were convinced that God ought to be worshipped? Why were they
   ashamed of adultery and theft, except that they deemed them evils?

   Without reason then is the power of the will deduced from this passage,
   as though Paul had said, that the keeping of the law is within our
   power; for he speaks not of the power to fulfill the law, but of the
   knowledge of it. Nor is the word heart to be taken for the seat of the
   affections, but only for the understanding, as it is found in
   Deuteronomy 29:4,

   "The Lord hath not given thee a heart to understand;"

   and in Luke 24:25,

   "O foolish men, and slow in heart to believe."

   Nor can we conclude from this passage, that there is in men a full
   knowledge of the law, but that there are only some seeds of what is
   right implanted in their nature, evidenced by such acts as these -- All
   the Gentiles alike instituted religious rites, they made laws to punish
   adultery, and theft, and murder, they commended good faith in bargains
   and contracts. They have thus indeed proved, that God ought to be
   worshipped, that adultery, and theft, and murder are evils, that
   honesty is commendable. It is not to our purpose to inquire what sort
   of God they imagined him to be, or how many gods they devised; it is
   enough to know, that they thought that there is a God, and that honor
   and worship are due to him. It matters not whether they permitted the
   coveting of another man's wife, or of his possessions, or of any thing
   which was his, -- whether they connived at wrath and hatred; inasmuch
   as it was not right for them to covet what they knew to be evil when
   done.

   Their conscience at the same time attesting, etc. He could not have
   more forcibly urged them than by the testimony of their own conscience,
   which is equal to a thousand witnesses. By the consciousness of having
   done good, men sustain and comfort themselves; those who are conscious
   of having done evil, are inwardly harassed and tormented. Hence came
   these sayings of the heathens -- "A good conscience is the widest
   sphere; but a bad one is the cruelest executioner, and more fiercely
   torments the ungodly than any furies can do." There is then a certain
   knowledge of the law by nature, which says, "This is good and worthy of
   being desired; that ought to be abhorred."

   But observe how intelligently he defines conscience: he says, that
   reasons come to our minds, by which we defend what is rightly done, and
   that there are those which accuse and reprove us for our vices; [74]
   and he refers this process of accusation and defense to the day of the
   Lord; not that it will then first commence, for it is now continually
   carried on, but that it will then also be in operation; and he says
   this, that no one should disregard this process, as though it were vain
   and evanescent. And he has put, in the day, instead of, at the day, --
   a similar instance to what we have already observed.

   16. In which God shall judge the secrets of men [75] Most suitable to
   the present occasion is this periphrastic definition of judgment: it
   teaches those, who willfully hide themselves in the recesses of
   insensibility, that the most secret thoughts and those now completely
   hid in the depths of their hearts, shall then be brought forth to the
   light. So he speaks in another place; in order to show to the
   Corinthians what little value belongs to human judgment, which regards
   only the outward action, he bids them to wait until the Lord came, who
   would bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the
   secrets of the heart. (1 Corinthians 4:5) When we hear this, let it
   come to our minds, that we are warned that if we wish to be really
   approved by our Judge, we must strive for sincerity of heart.

   He adds, according to my gospel, intimating, that he announced a
   doctrine, to which the judgments of men, naturally implanted in them,
   gave a response: and he calls it his gospel, on account of the
   ministry; for the authority for setting forth the gospel resides in the
   true God alone; and it was only the dispensing of it that was committed
   to the Apostles. It is indeed no matter of surprise, that the gospel is
   in part called the messenger and the announcer of future judgment: for
   if the fulfillment and completion of what it promises be deferred to
   the full revelation of the heavenly kingdom, it must necessarily be
   connected with the last judgment: and further, Christ cannot be
   preached without being a resurrection to some, and a destruction to
   others; and both these things have a reference to the day of judgment.
   The words, through Jesus Christ, I apply to the day of judgment, though
   they are regarded otherwise by some; and the meaning is, -- that the
   Lord will execute judgment by Christ, for he is appointed by the Father
   to be the Judge of the living and of the dead, -- which the Apostles
   always mention among the main articles of the gospel. Thus the sentence
   will be full and complete, which would otherwise be defective.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [72] As to the phrase, "these are a law unto themselves," Venema
   adduces classical examples -- pan to beltiston phainomenon esto soi
   nomos aparabatos "Whatever seems best, let it be to thee a perpetual
   law." -- Epict. in Ench., c. 75. "to men orthon nomos esti basilekos
   What is indeed right, is a royal law." -- Plato in Min., page 317. The
   heathens themselves acknowledged a law of nature. Turrettin quotes a
   passage from a lost work of Cicero, retained by Lactantius, which
   remarkably coincides with the language of Paul here -- Ed.

   [73] By the work of the law, to ergon tou nomou, is to be understood
   what the law requires. The "work of God," in John 6:29, is of the same
   import, that is, the work which God requires or demands; and the same
   word is plural in the former verse, ta erga -- "the works of God." So
   here, in the former verse, it is ta tou nomou -- "the things of the
   law," where we may suppose ergato be understood. The common expression,
   "the works of the law," has the same meaning, that is, such works as
   the law prescribes and requires. -- Ed.

   [74] Calvin seems to consider that the latter part of the verse is only
   a expansion or an exposition of the preceding clause respecting
   "conscience:" but it seems to contain a distinct idea. The testimony of
   conscience is one thing, which is instantaneous, without reflection:
   and the thoughts or the reasonings -- logismon, which alternately or
   mutually accuse or excuse, seem to refer to a process carried on by the
   mind, by which the innate voice of conscience is confirmed. This is the
   view taken by Stuart and Barnes, and to which Hodge is inclined.
   Another view of the latter clause is given by Doddridge, Macknight,
   Haldane, and Chalmers The last gives this paraphrase of the whole
   verse, -- "For they show that the matter of the law is written in their
   hearts -- both from their conscience testifying what is right and wrong
   in their own conduct, and from their reasonings in which they either
   accuse or vindicate one another." But to regard the two clauses as
   referring to conscience and the inward workings of the mind, appears
   more consistent with the context. The Gentiles are those spoken of: God
   gave them no outward law, but the law of nature which is inward. Hence
   in the following verse he speaks of God as judging "the secrets of
   men," as the inward law will be the rule of judgment to the Gentiles --
   Ed.

   [75] In accordance with some of the fathers, Jerome, Chrysostom,
   Theophylact, and others, Calvin connects this with the immediately
   preceding verse: but almost all modern critics connect it with the 12th
   verse, and consider what intervenes as parenthetic. This is according
   to our version. In the Romans 2:12, both the Gentile and the Jew are
   spoken of, and that with reference to judgment. In this verse the time
   and the character of that judgment are referred to, and its character
   especially as to the Gentile, as his case is particularly delineated in
   the parenthesis. The Apostle then, in what follows, turns to the Jew.
   "According to my gospel" must be understood, not as though the gospel
   is to be the rule of judgment to the Gentile, but as to the fact, that
   Christ is appointed to be the Judge of all. See Acts 17:31. -- Ed.

   Romans 2:17-24

   17. Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest
   thy boast of God,

   17. Ecce, tu Iud����us cognominaris, et acquiescis in Lege, et gloriaris
   in Deo,

   18. And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
   excellent, being instructed out of the law;

   18. Et nosti voluntatem, et probas eximia, institutus ex Lege;

   19. And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a
   light of them which are in darkness,

   19. Confidisque teipsum esse ducem c����corum, lumen eorum qui sunt in
   tenebris,

   20. An instructer of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the
   form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

   20. Eruditorem insipientium, doctorem imperitorum, habentem formam
   cognitionis ac veritatis in Lege:

   21. Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
   thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?

   21. Qui igitur doces alterum, teipsum non doces; qui concionaris, non
   furandum, furaris;

   22. Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit
   adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

   22. Qui dicis, nom moechandum, moecharis; qui detestaris idola,
   Sacrilegium perpetras;

   23. Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law
   dishonourest thou God?

   23. Qui de Lege gloriaris, Deum per Legis transgressionem dehonestas:

   24. For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you,
   as it is written. [76]

   24. Nomen enim Dei propter vos probro afficitur inter gentes,
   quemadmodum scriptum est.

   17. Behold, thou art named a Jew, etc. Some old copies read ei de,
   though indeed; which, were it generally received, would meet my
   approbation; but as the greater part of the manuscripts is opposed to
   it, and the sense is not unsuitable, I retain the old reading,
   especially as it is only a small difference of one letter. [77]

   Having now completed what he meant to say of the Gentiles, he returns
   to the Jews; and that he might, with greater force, beat down their
   great vanity, he allows them all those privileges, by which they were
   beyond measure transported and inflated: and then he shows how
   insufficient they were for the attainment of true glory, yea, how they
   turned to their reproach. Under the name Jew he includes all the
   privileges of the nation, which they vainly pretended were derived from
   the law and the prophets; and so he comprehends all the Israelites, all
   of whom were then, without any difference, called Jews.

   But at what time this name first originated it is uncertain, except
   that it arose, no doubt, after the dispersion. [78] Josephus, in the
   eleventh book of his Antiquities, thinks that it was taken from Judas
   Maccab����us, under whose auspices the liberty and honor of the people,
   after having for some time fallen, and been almost buried, revived
   again. Though I allow this opinion to be probable, yet, if there be
   some to whom it is not satisfactory, I will offer them a conjecture of
   my own. It seems, indeed, very likely, that after having been degraded
   and scattered through so many disasters, they were not able to retain
   any certain distinction as to their tribes; for a census could not have
   been made at that time, nor did there exist a regular government, which
   was necessary to preserve an order of this kind; and they dwelt
   scattered and in disorder; and having been worn out by adversities,
   they were no doubt less attentive to the records of their kindred. But
   though you may not grant these things to me, yet it cannot be denied
   but that a danger of this kind was connected with such disturbed state
   of things. Whether, then, they meant to provide for the future, or to
   remedy an evil already received, they all, I think assumed the name of
   that tribe, in which the purity of religion remained the longest, and
   which, by a peculiar privilege, excelled all the rest, as from it the
   Redeemer was expected to come; for it was their refuge in all
   extremities, to console themselves with the expectation of the Messiah.
   However this may be, by the name of Jews they avowed themselves to be
   the heirs of the covenant which the Lord had made with Abraham and his
   seed.

   And restest in the law, and gloriest in God, etc. He means not that
   they rested in attending to the law, as though they applied their minds
   to the keeping of it; but, on the contrary, he reproves them for not
   observing the end for which the law had been given; for they had no
   care for its observance, and were inflated on this account only, --
   because they were persuaded that the oracles of God belonged to them.
   In the same way they gloried in God, not as the Lord commands by his
   Prophet, -- to humble ourselves, and to seek our glory in him alone,
   (Jeremiah 9:24,) -- but being without any knowledge of God's goodness,
   they made him, of whom they were inwardly destitute, peculiarly their
   own, and assumed to be his people, for the purpose of vain ostentation
   before men. This, then, was not the glorying of the heart, but the
   boasting of the tongue.

   18. And knowest his will, and approvest things excellent, etc. He now
   concedes to them the knowledge of the divine will, and the approval of
   things useful; and this they had attained from the doctrine of the law.
   But there is a twofold approval, -- one of choice, when we embrace the
   good we approve; the other of judgment, by which indeed we distinguish
   good from evil, but by no means strive or desire to follow it. Thus the
   Jews were so learned in the law that they could pass judgment on the
   conduct of others, but were not careful to regulate their life
   according to that judgment. But as Paul reproves their hypocrisy, we
   may, on the other hand, conclude, that excellent things are then only
   rightly approved (provided our judgment proceeds from sincerity) when
   God is attended to; for his will, as it is revealed in the law, is here
   appointed as the guide and teacher of what is to be justly approved.
   [79]

   19. And believest thyself, etc. More is still granted to them; as
   though they had not only what was sufficient for themselves, but also
   that by which they could enrich others. He grants, indeed, that they
   had such abundance of learning, as that others might have been
   supplied. [80]

   20. I take what follows, having the form of knowledge, as a reason for
   the preceding; and it may be thus explained, -- "because thou hast the
   form of knowledge." For they professed to be the teachers of others,
   because they seemed to carry in their breasts all the secrets of the
   law. The word form is put for model (exemplar -- pattern); [81] for
   Paul has adopted morphosin and not tupon: but he intended, I think, to
   point out the conspicuous pomp of their teaching, and what is commonly
   called display; and it certainly appears that they were destitute of
   that knowledge which they pretended. But Paul, by indirectly ridiculing
   the perverted use of the law, intimates, on the other hand, that right
   knowledge must be sought from the law, in order that the truth may have
   a solid basis.

   21. Thou, who then teachest another, teachest not thyself, etc. [82]
   Though the excellencies (encomia -- commendations) which he has
   hitherto stated respecting the Jews, were such as might have justly
   adorned them, provided the higher ornaments were not wanting; yet as
   they included qualifications of a neutral kind, which may be possessed
   even by the ungodly and corrupted by abuse, they are by no means
   sufficient to constitute true glory. And hence Paul, not satisfied with
   merely reproving and taunting their arrogance in trusting in these
   things alone, employs them for the purpose of enhancing their
   disgraceful conduct; for he exposes himself to no ordinary measure of
   reproach, who not only renders useless the gifts of God, which are
   otherwise valuable and excellent, but by his wickedness vitiates and
   contaminates them. And a strange counselor is he, who consults not for
   his own good, and is wise only for the benefit of others. He shows then
   that the praise which they appropriated to themselves, turned out to
   their own disgrace.

   Thou who preachest, steal not, etc. He seems to have alluded to a
   passage in Psalm 50:16, where God says to the wicked,

   "Why dost thou declare my statutes, and takest my covenant in thy
   mouth? And thou hatest reform, and hast cast my words behind thee: when
   thou seest a thief, thou joinest him, and with adulterers is thy
   portion."

   And as this reproof was suitable to the Jews in old time, who, relying
   on the mere knowledge of the law, lived in no way better than if they
   had no law; so we must take heed, lest it should be turned against us
   at this day: and indeed it may be well applied to many, who, boasting
   of some extraordinary knowledge of the gospel, abandon themselves to
   every kind of uncleanness, as though the gospel were not a rule of
   life. That we may not then so heedlessly trifle with the Lord, let us
   remember what sort of judgment impends over such prattlers,
   (logodoedalis -- word-artificers,) who make a show of God's word by
   mere garrulity.

   22. Thou who abhorrest idols, etc. He fitly compares sacrilege to
   idolatry, as it is a thing of the same kind; for sacrilege is simply a
   profanation of the Divine Majesty, a sin not unknown to heathen poets.
   On this account Ovid (Metamor. 3,) calls Lycurgus sacrilegious for
   despising the rites of Bacchus; and in his Fasti he calls those
   sacrilegious hands which violated the majesty of Venus. But as the
   Gentiles ascribed the majesty of their gods to idols, they only thought
   it a sacrilege when any one plundered what was dedicated to their
   temples, in which, as they believed, the whole of religion centered. So
   at this day, where superstition reigns, and not the word of God, they
   acknowledge no other kind of sacrilege than the stealing of what
   belongs to churches, as there is no God but in idols, no religion but
   in pomp and magnificence. [83]

   Now we are here warned, first, not to flatter ourselves and to despise
   others, when we have performed only some portions of the law, -- and,
   secondly, not to glory in having outward idolatry removed, while we
   care not to drive away and to eradicate the impiety that lieth hid in
   our hearts.

   23. Thou who gloriest in the law, etc. Though every transgressor
   dishonors God, (for we are all born for this end -- to serve him in
   righteousness and holiness;) yet he justly imputes in this respect a
   special fault to the Jews; for as they avowed God as their Lawgiver,
   and yet had no care to form their life according to his rule, they
   clearly proved that the majesty of their God was not so regarded by
   them, but that they easily despised him. In the same manner do they at
   this day dishonor Christ, by transgressing the gospel, who prattle idly
   about its doctrine, while yet they tread it under foot by their
   unbridled and licentious mode of living.

   24. For the name of God, etc. I think this quotation is taken from
   Ezekiel 36:20, rather than from Isaiah 52:5; for in Isaiah there are no
   reproofs given to the people, but that chapter in Ezekiel is full of
   reproofs. But some think that it is a proof from the less to the
   greater, according to this import, "Since the Prophet upbraided, not
   without cause, the Jews of his time, that on account of their
   captivity, the glory and power of God were ridiculed among the
   Gentiles, as though he could not have preserved the people, whom he had
   taken under his protection, much more are ye a disgrace and dishonor to
   God, whose religion, being judged of by your wicked life, is
   blasphemed." This view I do not reject, but I prefer a simpler one,
   such as the following, -- "We see that all the reproaches cast on the
   people of Israel do fall on the name of God; for as they are counted,
   and are said to be the people of God, his name is as it were engraven
   on their foreheads: it must hence be, that God, whose name they assume,
   is in a manner defamed by men, through their wicked conduct." It was
   then a monstrous thing, that they who derived their glory from God
   should have disgraced his holy name; for it behoved them surely to
   requite him in a different manner. [84]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [76] These texts are referred to, Isaiah 52:6; Ezekiel 36:20.

   [77] Griesbach has since found a majority of MSS. in favor of this
   reading, and has adopted it. But the difficulty is to find a
   corresponding clause. There is none, except what begins in Romans 2:21;
   ei de and oun do not well respond, except we render the first, though
   indeed, and the other, yes or nevertheless somewhat in the sense of an
   adversative. It will admit this meaning in some passages. See Matthew
   12:12; Matthew 26:64; Romans 10:14. -- Ed.

   [78] This is not quite correct. They were called Jews even before the
   captivity, and during the captivity, but most commonly and regularly
   after it. The words Jews, first occurs in 2 Kings 16:6. See Esther 4:3;
   Jeremiah 38:19; Daniel 3:8; Ezra 4:12; Nehemiah 2:16. -- Ed.

   [79] There are two expositions of the words, dokimazeis ta diapheronta,
   which may be sustained according to what the words signify in other
   places. The first word means to prove, or test, or examine, and also to
   approve; and the second signifies things which differ, or things which
   are excellent. "Thou provest, or, distinguishest things which differ,"
   is the rendering of Beza, Pareus, Doddridge, and Stuart: "Thou
   approvest things excellent or useful," is the rendering of Erasmus,
   Macknight, and others. The first is the most suitable to the context,
   as knowledge, and not approval, is evidently intended, as proved by the
   explanatory clause which follows, -- "being instructed out of the law."
   -- Ed.

   [80] Calvin has passed over here several clauses: they are so plain as
   to require no remarks, except the two last. "The instructor of the
   unwise -- insipientium," aphronon, of such as were foolish from not
   understanding things rightly. "The teacher of the ignorant --
   imperitorum," nepion, babes, that is, of such as were ignorant like
   babes. But these and the foregoing titles, "the guide of the blind,"
   and, "light to those in darkness," were such as the Jewish doctors
   assumed, and are not to be considered as having any great difference in
   their real meaning. There seems to be no reason to suppose, with
   Doddridge and some others, that "the blind, foolish, ignorant" were the
   Gentiles, for the Jews did not assume the office of teaching them. It
   is to be observed that Paul here takes the case, not of the common
   people, but of the learned -- the teachers.

   [81] The same word occurs only in 2 Timothy 3:5, "morphosin eusebeias
   -- the form of godliness." It is taken here in a good sense, as meaning
   a sketch, a delineation, an outline, a representation, or a summary.
   Chalmers renders the words thus, -- "The whole summary of knowledge and
   truth which is in the law." Some understand by knowledge what refers to
   morals or outward conduct, and by truth what is to be believed. Others
   regard them as an instance of Hebrewism, two substantives being put,
   instead of a substantive and an adjective; the phrase would then be,
   "true knowledge." -- Ed.

   [82] This clause, and those which follow, are commonly put in an
   interrogatory form, that is, as questions: but some, as Theophylact,
   Erasmus and Luther, have rendered the clauses in the form here adopted.
   There is no difference in the meaning. It is worthy of notice, that the
   Apostle, after the Hebrew manner, reverses the order as to the points
   he mentions; he, as it were, retrogrades, and begins to do so at Romans
   2:21. The passage may be thus rendered, -- 17. Seeing then, thou art
   named a Jew, And reliest on the law, and gloriest in God, 18. And
   knowest his will, And decernest things which differ, being taught by
   the law, 19. And art confident that thou art A leader to the blind, a
   light to those in darkness, 20. An instructor to the foolish, a teacher
   to babes, Having the form of knowledge and of truth according to the
   law: 21. Yet thou, who teachest another, teachest not thyself, Thou,
   who preachest, "Steal not," stealest, 22. Thou, who sayest, "Commit no
   adultery," committest adultery, Thou who detestest idols, committest
   sacrilege, 23. Thou who gloriest in the law, by transgressing the law
   dishonorest God; For the name of God, as it is written, is through you
   blasphemed by the Gentiles. Romans 2:21, and part of the 22nd, refer to
   what is contained in Romans 19 and the 20th; and the latter part of the
   22nd to the 18th verse; and 23rd to the 17th. The latter part of the
   22nd helps us to fix the meaning of the latter part of the 18th; the
   man who hated idols and committed sacrilege proved that he did not
   exercise his boasted power of making a proper distinction between right
   and wrong. Then the man who is said, in Romans 2:17, to rely on the law
   and glory in God, is charged, in Romans 2:23, with the sin of
   dishonoring God by transgressing the law -- Ed.

   [83] "Sacrilege," mentioned here, is by some taken literally as meaning
   the robbing of God as to the sacrifices he required, and the
   profanation of sacred rites; "many examples of which," says Turrettin,
   "are recorded by the Prophets, and also by Josephus, both before and
   during the last war." But some extend its meaning to acts of hypocrisy
   and ungodliness, by which God's honor was profaned, and the glory due
   to him was denied. The highest sacrilege, no doubt, is to deprive God
   of that sincere service and obedience which he justly requires. "They
   caused," says Pareus, "the name and honor of God to be in various ways
   blasphemed by their wicked hypocrisy; and hence they were justly said
   by the Apostle to be guilty of sacrilege." He then adds, "we must
   notice, that idolatry is not opposed to sacrilege, but mentioned as a
   thing closely allied to it. Indeed all idolatry is sacrilegious. How
   then can the Monks, Priests, and Jesuits clear themselves from the
   charge of sacrilege? for they not only do not detest idolatry, being in
   this respect much worse than these hypocrites, but also greedily seek,
   like them, sacred offerings, and under the pretense of sanctity devour
   widows' houses, pillage the coffers of kings, and, what is most
   heinous, sacrilegiously rob God of his due worship and honor and
   transfer them to saints." Yet the world is so blind as not to see the
   real character of such men! -- Ed.

   [84] On this remarkable passage Haldane has these very appropriate,
   just, and striking observations, -- "The Apostle, in these verses,
   exhibits the most lively image of hypocrisy. Was there ever a more
   beautiful veil than that under which the Jew presents himself? He is a
   man of confession, of praise, of thanksgiving -- a man, whose trust is
   in the Law, whose boast is of God, who knows his will, who approves of
   things that are excellent, a man who calls himself a conductor of the
   blind, a light of those who are in darkness, an instructor of the
   ignorant, a teacher of babes; a man who directs others, who preaches
   against theft, against adultery, against idolatry, and to sum up the
   whole, a man who glories in the commandments of the Lord. Who would not
   say that this is an angel arrayed in human form -- a star detached from
   the firmament, and brought nearer to enlighten the earth? But observe
   what is concealed under this mask. It is a man who is himself untaught;
   it is a thief, an adulterer, a sacrilegious person; in one word, a
   wicked man, who continually dishonors God by the transgression of his
   law. Is it possible to imagine a contrast more monstrous than between
   these fair appearances and this awful reality?" No, certainly; but it
   is a contrast which still exists, with various modifications, in many
   instances. -- It ought to be observed, that when the author calls the
   Jew "a man of confession, of praise, of thanksgiving," he alludes to
   the import of the word, Jew, in Hebrew, which is derived from a verb,
   which includes these ideas: and it is supposed by some, that there is
   an allusion in the last words of this chapter, "whose praise," etc., to
   what the name signifies. -- Ed.

   Romans 2:25-29

   25. For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if
   thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

   25. Nam circumcisio quidem prodest, si Legem observes; quod si
   transgressor Legis fueris, circumcisio tua in pr����putium versa est.

   26. Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,
   shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

   26. Si ergo pr����putium justitias Legis servaverit, nonne pr����putium ejus
   pro circumcisione consebitur?

   27. And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the
   law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the
   law?

   27. Et judicabit quod ex natura est pr����putium (si Legem servaverit) te
   qui per literam et circumcisionem transgressor es Legis?

   28. For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that
   circumcision which is outward in the flesh:

   28. Non enim qui est in aperto Iud����us est; ne qu���� in aperto est
   circumcisio in carne, ea est circumcisio:

   29. But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of
   the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of
   men, but of God.

   29. Sed qui est in occulto Iud����us; et circumcisio cordis in spiritu non
   litera; cujus laus non ex hominibus est sed ex Deo.

   25. For circumcision indeed profits, etc. He dissipates by anticipation
   what the Jews might have objected in opposition to him in the defense
   of their own cause: for since circumcision was a symbol of the Lord's
   covenant, by which he had chosen Abraham and his seed as his peculiar
   people, they seemed not to have gloried in vain; but as they neglected
   what the sign signified, and regarded only the outward form, he gives
   this answer -- That they had no reason to lay claim to any thing on
   account of the bare sign. The true character of circumcision was a
   spiritual promise, which required faith: the Jews neglected both, the
   promise as well as faith. Then foolish was their confidence. Hence it
   is, that he omits to state here the main use of circumcision, and
   proceeds to expose their gross error, as he does in his Epistle to the
   Galatians. And this ought to be carefully noticed; for if he were
   explaining the whole character and design of circumcision, it would
   have been inconsistent in him not to have made mention of grace and
   free promise: but in both instances he spoke according to what the
   subject he had in hand required, and therefore he only discussed that
   part which was controverted.

   They thought that circumcision was of itself sufficient for the purpose
   of obtaining righteousness. Hence, speaking according to such an
   opinion, he gives this reply -- That if this benefit be expected from
   circumcision, it is on this condition, that he who is circumcised, must
   serve God wholly and perfectly. Circumcision then requires perfection.
   The same may be also said of our baptism: when any one confidently
   relies on the water of baptism alone, and thinks that he is justified,
   as though he had obtained holiness by that ordinance itself, the end of
   baptism must be adduced as an objection; which is, that the Lord
   thereby calls us to holiness of life: the grace and promise, which
   baptism testifies (testificatur) and seals, (obsignat,) need not in
   this case to be mentioned; for our business is with those who, being
   satisfied with the empty shadow of baptism, care not for nor consider
   what is material (solidum -- substantial) in it. And this very thing
   you may observe in Paul -- that when he speaks to the faithful of
   signs, apart from controversy, he connects them with the efficacy and
   fulfillment of the promises which belong to them; but when he contends
   with the absurd and unskillful interpreters of signs, he omits all
   mention of the proper and true character of signs, and directs his
   whole discourse against their perverted interpretation.

   Now many, seeing that Paul brings forward circumcision rather than any
   other part of the law, suppose that he takes away justification only
   from ceremonies: but the matter is far otherwise; for it always
   happens, that those who dare to set up their own merits against the
   righteousness of God, glory more in outward observances than in real
   goodness; for no one, who is seriously touched and moved by the fear of
   God, will ever dare to raise up his eyes to heaven, since the more he
   strives after true righteousness, the clearer he sees how far he is
   from it. But as to the Pharisees, who were satisfied with imitating
   holiness by an outward disguise, it is no wonder that they so easily
   deluded themselves. Hence Paul, after having left the Jews nothing, but
   this poor subterfuge of being justified by circumcision, does now also
   take from them even this empty pretense.

   26. If then the uncircumcision, etc. This is a very strong argument.
   Every thing is below its end and subordinate to it. Circumcision looks
   to the law, and must therefore be inferior to it: it is then a greater
   thing to keep the law than circumcision, which was for its sake
   instituted. It hence follows, that the uncircumcised, provided he keeps
   the law, far excels the Jew with his barren and unprofitable
   circumcision, if he be a transgressor of the law: and though he is by
   nature polluted, he shall yet be so sanctified by keeping the law, that
   uncircumcision shall be imputed to him for circumcision. The word
   uncircumcision, is to be taken in its proper sense in the second
   clause; but in the first, figuratively, for the Gentiles, the thing for
   the persons.

   It must be added -- that no one ought anxiously to inquire what
   observers of the law are those of which Paul speaks here, inasmuch no
   such can be found; for he simply intended to lay down a supposed case
   -- that if any Gentile could be found who kept the law, his
   righteousness would be of more value without circumcision, than the
   circumcision of the Jew without righteousness. And hence I refer what
   follows, And what is by nature uncircumcision shall judge thee, etc.,
   not to persons, but to the case that is supposed, according to what is
   said of the Queen of the south, that she shall come, etc., (Matthew
   12:42,) and of the men of Nineveh, that they shall rise up in judgment,
   etc., (Luke 11:32) For the very words of Paul lead us to this view --
   "The Gentile," he says, "being a keeper of the law, shall judge thee
   who art a transgressor, though he is uncircumcised, and thou hast the
   literal circumcision."

   27. By the letter and circumcision, etc. A construction [85] which
   means a literal circumcision. He does not mean that they violated the
   law, because they had the literal circumcision; but because they
   continued, though they had the outward rite, to neglect the spiritual
   worship of God, even piety, justice, judgment, and truth, which are the
   chief matters of the law. [86]

   28. For a Jew is not he, etc. The meaning is, that a real Jew is not to
   be ascertained, either by natural descent, or by profession, or by an
   external symbol; that the circumcision which constitutes a Jew, does
   not consist in an outward sign only, but that both are inward. And what
   he subjoins with regard to true circumcision, is taken from various
   passages of Scripture, and even from its general teaching; for the
   people are everywhere commanded to circumcise their hearts, and it is
   what the Lord promises to do. The fore-skin was cut off, not indeed as
   the small corruption of one part, but as that of the whole nature.
   Circumcision then signified the mortification of the whole flesh.

   29. What he then adds, in the spirit, not in the letter, understand
   thus: He calls the outward rite, without piety, the letter, and the
   spiritual design of this rite, the spirit; for the whole importance of
   signs and rites depends on what is designed; when the end in view is
   not regarded, the letter alone remains, which in itself is useless. And
   the reason for this mode of speaking is this, -- where the voice of God
   sounds, all that he commands, except it be received by men in sincerity
   of heart, will remain in the letter, that is, in the dead writing; but
   when it penetrates into the heart, it is in a manner transformed into
   spirit. And there is an allusion to the difference between the old and
   the new covenant, which Jeremiah points out in Jeremiah 31:33; where
   the Lord declares that his covenant would be firm and permanent when
   engraven on the inward parts. Paul had also the same thing in view in
   another place, (2 Corinthians 3:6,) where he compares the law with the
   gospel, and calls the former "the letter," which is not only dead but
   killeth; and the latter he signalizes with the title of "spirit." But
   extremly gross has been the folly of those who have deduced a double
   meaning from the "letter," and allegories from the "spirit."

   Whose praise is not from men, etc. As men fix their eyes only on those
   things which are visible, he denies that we ought to be satisfied with
   what is commendable in the estimation of men, who are often deceived by
   outward splendor; but that we ought to be satisfied with the all-seeing
   eyes of God, from which the deepest secrets of the heart are not hid.
   He thus again summons hypocrites, who soothe themselves with false
   opinions, to the tribunal of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] Hypallage, substitution, a figure of speech, by which a noun or an
   adjective is put in a form different from its obvious import. -- Ed

   [86] The rendering of this clause is rather obscure, "who by the letter
   and circumcision dost transgress the law." The preposition, dia, has no
   doubt the meaning of en or sun, as in some other passages, as in Romans
   4:11, di akrobustias -- in uncircumcision, and in Romans 8:25, di
   upomonos -- in or with patience. Then the version should be, "who,
   being with, or having, the letter and circumcision, dost transgress the
   law." The "letter" means the written law. That this is the meaning is
   evident from the context. Both Grotius and Macknight give the same
   construction. It is better to take "letter," i.e., the law, and
   "circumcision" separate, than to amalgamate them by a rhetorical
   figure, as is done by Calvin and others. Hodge justly says, that this
   is "more suited to the context, as nothing is said here of spiritual
   circumcision." The word gramma, letter, has various meanings -- 1. What
   is commonly called letter, the character, Luke 23:38, -- 2. What is
   written, a bond or contract, Luke 16:6; -- 3. In the plural, letters,
   epistles, Acts 28:21; -- 4. The written law, as here, and in the
   plural, the Old Testament Scriptures, 2 Timothy 3:15; -- 5. What is
   conveyed by writing, learning, John 7:15; Acts 26:24; -- and, 6. The
   outward performance of the law, it being written, as opposed to what is
   spiritual or inward, as in the last verse of this chapter, and in 2
   Corinthians 3:6. -- Ed

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 3:1-2

   1. What advantage [87] then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
   circumcision?

   1. Quae igitur praerogativa Iudaei, aut quae utilitas circumcisionis?

   2. Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the
   oracles of God.

   2. Multa per omnem modem; ac primum quidem, quod illis credits sunt
   oracula Dei.

   1. Though Paul has clearly proved that bare circumcision brought
   nothing to the Jews, yet since he could not deny but that there was
   some difference between the Gentiles and the Jews, which by that symbol
   was sealed to them by the Lord, and since it was inconsistent to make a
   distinction, of which God was the author, void and of no moment, it
   remained for him to remove also this objection. It was indeed evident,
   that it was a foolish glorying in which the Jews on this account
   indulged; yet still a doubt remained as to the design of circumcision;
   for the Lord would not have appointed it had not some benefit been
   intended. He therefore, by way of an objection, asks, what it was that
   made the Jew superior to the Gentile; and he subjoins a reason for this
   by another question, What is the benefit of circumcision? For this
   separated the Jews from the common class of men; it was a
   partition-wall, as Paul calls ceremonies, which kept parties asunder.

   2. Much in every way, etc.; that is, very much. He begins here to give
   the sacrament its own praise; but he concedes not, that on this account
   the Jews ought to have been proud; for when he teaches that they were
   sealed by the symbol of circumcision, by which they were counted the
   children of God, he does not allow that they became superior to others
   through any merit or worthiness of their own, but through the free
   mercy of God. If then regard be had to them as men, he shows that they
   were on a level with others; but if the favors of God be taken to the
   account, he admits that they possessed what made them more eminent than
   other men.

   First indeed, because, intrusted to them, etc. Some think there is here
   an unfinished period, for he sets down what he does not afterwards
   complete. But the word first seems not to me to be a note of number,
   but means chiefly" or especially, [88] and is to be taken in this sense
   -- "Though it were but this one thing, that they have the oracles [89]
   of God committed to them, it might be deemed sufficient to prove their
   superiority." And it is worthy of being noticed, that the advantage of
   circumcision is not made to consist in the naked sign, but its value is
   derived from the word; for Paul asks here what benefit the sacrament
   conferred on the Jews, and he answers, that God had deposited with them
   the treasure of celestial wisdom. It hence follows, that, apart from
   the word, no excellency remained. By oracles he means the covenant
   which God revealed first to Abraham and to his posterity, and
   afterwards sealed and unfolded by the law and the Prophets.

   Now the oracles were committed to them, for the purpose of preserving
   them as long as it pleased the Lord to continue his glory among them,
   and then of publishing them during the time of their stewardship
   through the whole world: they were first depositories, and secondly
   dispensers. But if this benefit was to be so highly esteemed when the
   Lord favored one nation only with the revelation of his word, we can
   never sufficiently reprobate our ingratitude, who receive his word with
   so much negligence or with so much carelessness, not to say disdain.

   Romans 3:3-4

   3. For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
   faith of God without effect?

   3. Quid enigma si quidem fuerunt increduli? Num incredulitas eorum
   fidem Dei faciet irritam?

   4. God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is
   written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest
   overcome when thou art judged.

   4. Ne ita sit; quin sit Deus verax, omnis autem homo mendax;
   quemadmodum scriptum est, ut justificeris in sermonibus tuis, et vincas
   quum judicaris. [90]

   3. What indeed if some, etc. As before, while regarding the Jews as
   exulting in the naked sign, he allowed them no not even a spark of
   glory; so now, while considering the nature of the sign, he testifies
   that its virtue (virtutem, efficacy) is not destroyed, no, not even by
   their inconstancy. As then he seemed before to have intimated that
   whatever grace there might have been in the sign of circumcision, it
   had wholly vanished through the ingratitude of the Jews, he now,
   anticipating an objection, again asks what opinion was to be formed of
   it. There is here indeed a sort of reticence, as he expresses less than
   what he intended to be understood; for he might have truly said that a
   great part of the nation had renounced the covenant of God; but as this
   would have been very grating to the ears of the Jews, he mitigated its
   severity, and mentioned only some.

   Shall their unbelief, etc. Katargein is properly to render void and
   ineffectual; a meaning most suitable to this passage. For Paul's
   inquiry is not so much whether the unbelief of men neutralizes the
   truth of God, so that it should not in itself remain firm and constant,
   but whether it hinders its effect and fulfillment as to men. The
   meaning then is, "Since most of the Jews are covenant-breakers, is
   God's covenant so abrogated by their perfidiousness that it brings
   forth no fruit among them? To this he answers, that it cannot be that
   the truth of God should lose its stability through man's wickedness.
   Though then the greater part had nullified and trodden under foot God's
   covenant, it yet retained its efficacy and manifested its power, not
   indeed as to all, but with regard to a few of that nation: and it is
   then efficacious when the grace or the blessing of the Lord avails to
   eternal salvation. But this cannot be, except when the promise is
   received by faith; for it is in this way that a mutual covenant is on
   both sides confirmed. He then means that some ever remained in that
   nation, who by continuing to believe in the promise, had not fallen
   away from the privileges of the covenant.

   4. But let God be true, etc. Whatever may be the opinion of others, I
   regard this as an argument taken from the necessary consequence of what
   is opposed to it, by which Paul invalidates the preceding objection.
   For since these two things stand together, yea, necessarily accord,
   that God is true and that man is false, it follows that the truth of
   God is not nullified by the falsehood of men; for except he did now set
   those two things in opposition, the one to the other, he would
   afterwards have in vain labored to refute what was absurd, and show how
   God is just, though he manifests his justice by our unjustice. Hence
   the meaning is by no means ambiguous, -- that the faithfulness of God
   is so far from being nullified by the perfidy and apostasy of men that
   it thereby becomes more evident. "God," he says, "is true, not only
   because he is prepared to stand faithfully to his promises, but because
   he also really fulfills whatever he declares; for he so speaks, that
   his command becomes a reality. On the other hand, man is false, not
   only because he often violates his pledged faith, but because he
   naturally seeks falsehood and shuns the truth."

   The first clause contains the primary axiom of all Christian
   philosophy; the latter is taken from Psalm 116:11, where David
   confesses that there is nothing certain from man or in man.

   Now this is a remarkable passage, and contains a consolation that is
   much needed; for such is the perversity of men in rejecting and
   despising God's word, that its truth would be often doubted were not
   this to come to our minds, that God's verity depends not on man's
   verity. But how does this agree with what has been said previously --
   that in order to make the divine promise effectual, faith, which
   receives it, is on the part of men necessary? for faith stands opposed
   to falsehood. This seems, indeed, to be a difficult question; but it
   may with no great difficulty be answered, and in this way -- the Lord,
   notwithstanding the lies of men, and though these are hinderances to
   his truth, does yet find a way for it through a pathless track, that he
   may come forth a conqueror, and that is, by correcting in his elect the
   inbred unbelief of our nature, and by subjecting to his service those
   who seem to be unconquerable. It must be added, that the discourse here
   is concerning the corruption of nature, and not the grace of God, which
   is the remedy for that corruption.

   That thou mightest be justified, etc. The sense is, So far is it that
   the truth of God is destroyed by our falsehood and unfaithfulness, that
   it thereby shines forth and appears more evident, according to the
   testimony of David, who says, that as he was sinner, God was a just and
   righteous Judge in whatever he determined respecting him, and that he
   would overcome all the calumnies of the ungodly who murmured against
   his righteousness. By the words of God, David means the judgments which
   he pronounces upon us; for the common application of these to promises
   is too strained: and so the particle that, is not so much final, nor
   refers to a far-fetched consequence, but implies an inference according
   to this purport, "Against thee have I sinned; justly then dost thou
   punish me." And that Paul has quoted this passage according to the
   proper and real meaning of David, is clear from the objection that is
   immediately added, "How shall the righteousness of God remain perfect
   if our iniquity illustrates it?" For in vain, as I have already
   observed, and unseasonable has Paul arrested the attention of his
   readers with this difficulty, except David meant, that God, in his
   wonderful providence, elicited from the sins of men a praise to his own
   righteousness. The second clause in Hebrew is this, "And that thou
   mightest be pure in thy judgment;" which expression imports nothing
   else but that God in all his judgments is worthy of praise, how much
   soever the ungodly may clamor and strive by their complaints
   disgracefully to efface his glory. But Paul has followed the Greek
   version, which answered his purpose here even better. We indeed know
   that the Apostles in quoting Scripture often used a freer language than
   the original; for they counted it enough to quote what was suitable to
   their subject: hence they made no great account of words.

   The application then of this passage is the following: Since all the
   sins of mortals must serve to illustrate the glory of the Lord, and
   since he is especially glorified by his truth, it follows, that even
   the falsehood of men serves to confirm rather than to subvert his
   truth. Though the word krinesthai, may be taken actively as well as
   passively, yet the Greek translators, I have no doubt, rendered it
   passively, contrary to the meaning of the Prophet. [91]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [90] The references in the margin are the following: -- Romans 9:6; 2
   Timothy 2:13; John 3:33; Psalm 116:11; Psalm 51:4.

   [91] Whenever there is a material agreement between the Greek and the
   Hebrew, we ought not to make it otherwise. If the verb krinesthai, as
   admitted by most critics, may be taken actively and be thus made to
   agree with the Hebrew, what reason can there be to take it in another
   sense? The only real difference is in one word, between nikeses,
   "overcomest," and tzkh, "art clear:" but the meaning is the same,
   though the words are different. To overcome in judgment, and to be
   clear in judgment, amounts to the same thing. The parallelism of the
   Hebrew requires krinesthai to be a verb in the middle voice, and to
   have an active meaning. The two lines in Hebrew, as it is often the
   case in Hebrew poetry, contain the same sentiment in different words,
   the last line expressing it more definitely; so that to be "justified,"
   and to be "cleared," convey the same idea; and also "in thy word," or
   saying -- vdvrk and "in thy judgment" vsphtk. In many copies both these
   last words are in the plural number, so that the first would be
   strictly what is here expressed, "in thy words," that is, the words
   which thou hast declared; and "in thy judgments," that is, those which
   thou hast announced, would be fully rendered by "when thou Judgest."
   Commentators, both ancient and modern, have differed on the meaning of
   the verb in question. Pareus, Beza, Macknight, and Stuart, take it in
   an active sense; while Erasmus, Grotius, Venema, and others, contend
   for the passive meaning. Drusius, Hammond, and Doddridge render it,
   "when thou contendest in judgment," or, "when thou art called to
   judgment:" and such a meaning no doubt the verb has according to
   Matthew 5:40, and 1 Corinthians 6:1, 6. But in this case regard must be
   had, especially to the meaning which corresponds the nearest with the
   original Hebrew. Some have maintained that "in thy judgment" vsphtk may
   be rendered "in judging thee;" but this would not only be unusual and
   make the sentence hardly intelligible, but also destroy the evident
   parallelism of the two lines. The whole verse may be thus literally
   rendered from the Hebrew, -- Against thee, against thee only have I
   sinned;
   And the evil before thine eyes have I done;
   So that thou art justified in thy words,
   And clear in thy judgments. The conjunction lmn, admits of being
   rendered so that; see Psalm 30:12; Isaiah 41:20; Amos 2:7; and hopos in
   many instances may be thus rendered; see Luke 2:35; Philemon 6; 1 Peter
   2:9. It is what Schleusner designates ekbatikos, signifying the issue
   or the event. Pareus connects the passage differently. He considers the
   former part of the verse parenthetic, or as specifying what is
   generally stated in the previous verse, the third; and with that verse
   he connects this passage: so that the rendering of the two verses would
   be the following, -- 3. For my transgression I acknowledge, And my sin
   is before me continually, -- 4. (Against thee, against thee only have I
   sinned, and the evil before thine eyes have I done,) That thou mightest
   be justified in thy saying, And clear in thy judgment. This is
   certainty more probable than what Vatablus and Houbigant propose, who
   connect the passage with the second verse, "Wash me thoroughly," etc.
   But the sense given by Calvin is the most satisfactory -- Ed.

   Romans 3:5-8

   5. But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
   shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a
   man)

   5. Quod si injustitia nostra Dei justitiam commendat, quid dicemus? Num
   injustus est Deus qui infert iram? Secundum hominem dico.

   6. God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

   6. Ne ita sit: nam quomodo judicabit Deus mundum?

   7. For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his
   glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

   7. Si enim veritas Dei per meum mendacium excelluit in ejus gloriam;
   quid etiammum et ego velut peccator judicor;

   8. And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm
   that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is
   just.

   8. Et non (quemadmodum exprobratur nobis, et quemadmodum aiunt quidam
   nos dicere) Faciamus mala, ut veniant bona? quorum judicium justum est.

   5 But if our unrighteousness, etc. Though this is a digression from the
   main subject, it was yet necessary for the Apostle to introduce it,
   lest he should seem to give to the ill-disposed an occasion to speak
   evil, which he knew would be readily laid hold on by them. For since
   they were watching for every opportunity to defame the gospel, they
   had, in the testimony of David, what they might have taken for the
   purpose of founding a calumny, -- "If God seeks nothing else, but to be
   glorified by men, why does he punish them, when they offend, since by
   offending they glorify him? Without cause then surely is he offended,
   if he derives the reason of his displeasure from that by which he is
   glorified." There is, indeed, no doubt, but that this was an ordinary,
   and everywhere a common calumny, as it will presently appear. Hence
   Paul could not have covertly passed it by; but that no one should think
   that he expressed the sentiments of his own mind, he premises that he
   assumes the person of the ungodly; and at the same time, he sharply,
   touches, by a single expression, on human reason; whose work, as he
   intimates, is ever to bark against the wisdom of God; for he says not,
   "according to the ungodly," but "according to man," or as man. And thus
   indeed it is, for all the mysteries of God are paradoxes to the flesh:
   and at the same tine it possesses so much audacity, that it fears not
   to oppose them and insolently to assail what it cannot comprehend. We
   are hence reminded, that if we desire to become capable of
   understanding them, we must especially labor to become freed from our
   own reason, (proprio sensu) and to give up ourselves, and unreservedly
   to submit to his word. -- The word wrath, taken here for judgment,
   refers to punishment; as though he said, "Is God unjust, who punishes
   those sins which set forth his righteousness?"

   6. By no means, etc. In checking this blasphemy he gives not a direct
   reply to the objection, but begins with expressing his abhorrence of
   it, lest the Christian religion should even appear to include
   absurdities so great. And this is more weighty than if he adopted a
   simple denial; for he implies, that this impious expression deserved to
   be regarded with horror, and not to be heard. He presently subjoins
   what may be called an indirect refutation; for he does not distinctly
   refute the calumny, but gives only this reply, -- that the objection
   was absurd. Moreover, he takes an argument from an office which belongs
   to God, by which he proves it to be impossible, -- God shall judge the
   world; he cannot then be unjust.

   This argument is not derived, so to speak, from the mere power of God,
   but from his exercised power, which shines forth in the whole
   arrangement and order of his works; as though he said, -- "It is God's
   work to judge the world, that is, to rectify it by his own
   righteousness, and to reduce to the best order whatever there is in it
   out of order: he cannot then determine any thing unjustly." And he
   seems to allude to a passage recorded by Moses, in Genesis 18:25, where
   it is said, that when Abraham prayed God not to deliver Sodom wholly to
   destruction, he spoke to this purpose, --

   "It is not meet, that thou who art to judge the earth, shouldest
   destroy the just with the ungodly: for this is not thy work nor can it
   be done by thee."

   A similar declaration is found in Job 34:17, --

   "Should he who hates judgment exercise power?"

   For though there are found among men unjust judges, yet this happens,
   because they usurp authority contrary to law and right, or because they
   are inconsiderately raised to that eminence, or because they degenerate
   from themselves. But there is nothing of this kind with regard to God.
   Since, then, he is by nature judge, it must be that he is just, for he
   cannot deny himself. Paul then proves from what is impossible, that God
   is absurdly accused of unrighteousness; for to him peculiarly and
   naturally belongs the work of justly governing the world. And though
   what Paul teaches extends to the constant government of God, yet I
   allow that it has a special reference to the last judgment; for then
   only a real restoration of just order will take place. But if you wish
   for a direct refutation, by which profane things of this kind may be
   checked, take this, and say, "That it comes not through what
   unrighteousness is, that God's righteousness becomes more illustrious,
   but that our wickedness is so surpassed by God's goodness, that it is
   turned to serve an end different from that to which it tends."

   7. If indeed [92] the truth of God, etc. This objection, I have no
   doubt, is adduced in the person of the ungodly; for it is a sort of an
   explanation of the former verse, and would have been connected with it,
   had not the Apostle, moved with indignation, broken off the sentence in
   the middle. The meaning of the objection is -- "If by our
   unfaithfulness the truth of God becomes more conspicuous, and in a
   manner confirmed, and hence more glory redounds to him, it is by no
   means just, that he, who serves to display God's glory, should be
   punished as a sinner." [93]

   8. And not, etc. This is an elliptical sentence, in which a word is to
   be understood. It will be complete, if you read it thus, -- "and why is
   it not rather said, (as we are reproached, etc.) that we are to do
   evils, that good things may come?" But the Apostle deigns not to answer
   the slander; which yet we may check by the most solid reason. The
   pretense, indeed, is this, -- "If God is by our iniquity glorified, and
   if nothing can be done by man in this life more befitting than to
   promote the glory of God, then let us sin to advance his glory!" Now
   the answer to this is evident, -- "That evil cannot of itself produce
   anything but evil; and that God's glory is through our sin illustrated,
   is not the work of man, but the work of God; who, as a wonderful
   worker, knows how to overcome our wickedness, and to convert it to
   another end, so as to turn it contrary to what we intend, to the
   promotion of his own glory." God has prescribed to us the way, by which
   he would have himself to be glorified by us, even by true piety, which
   consists in obedience to his word. He who leaps over this boundary,
   strives not to honor God, but to dishonor him. That it turns out
   otherwise, is to be ascribed to the Providence of God, and not to the
   wickedness of man; through which it comes not, that the majesty of God
   is not injured, nay, wholly overthrown [94]

   (As we are reproached,) etc. Since Paul speaks so reverently of the
   secret judgments of God, it is a wonder that his enemies should have
   fallen into such wantonness as to calumniate him: but there has never
   been so much reverence and seriousness displayed by God's servants as
   to be sufficient to check impure and virulent tongues. It is not then a
   new thing, that adversaries at this day load with so many false
   accusations, and render odious our doctrine, which we ourselves know to
   be the pure gospel of Christ, and all the angels, as well as the
   faithful, are our witnesses. Nothing can be imagined more monstrous
   than what we read here was laid to the charge of Paul, to the end, that
   his preaching might be rendered hateful to the inexperienced. Let us
   then bear this evil, when the ungodly abuse the truth which we preach
   by their calumnies: nor let us cease, on this account, constantly to
   defend the genuine confession of it, inasmuch as it has sufficient
   power to crush and to dissipate their falsehoods. Let us, at the same
   time, according to the Apostle's example, oppose, as much as we can,
   all malicious subtilties, (technis -- crafts, wiles,) that the base and
   the abandoned may not, without some check, speak evil of our Creator.

   Whose judgment is just. Some take this in an active sense, as
   signifying that Paul so far assents to them, that what they objected
   was absurd, in order that the doctrine of the gospel might not be
   thought to be connected with such paradoxes: but I approve more of the
   passive meaning; for it would not have been suitable simply to express
   an approval of such a wickedness, which, on the contrary, deserved to
   be severely condemned; and this is what Paul seems to me to have done.
   And their perverseness was, on two accounts, to be condemned, -- first,
   because this impiety had gained the assent of their minds; and
   secondly, because, in traducing the gospel, they dared to draw from it
   their calumny.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [92] Or, "For if" -- Si enim -- ei gar. The particle gar here gives no
   reason, but is to be viewed as meaning then, or indeed, verily; see
   Luke 12:58; John 9:30; Acts 16:37; Philippians 2:27 Stuart renders it,
   still, and says, that it "points to a connection with verse. 5, and
   denotes a continuance of the same theme." Macknight often renders it by
   further, besides, and no doubt rightly. -- Ed.

   [93] It is remarkable how the Apostle changes his words from the third
   verse to the end of this, while the same things are essentially meant.
   His style is throughout Hebraistic. Stuart makes these just remarks,
   "Adikia is here [Romans 3:5] the generic appellation of sin, for which
   a specific name, apistia, was employed in Romans 3:3, and pseusma, in
   Romans 3:7. In like manner the dikaiosune, in Romans 3:5, which is a
   generic appellation, is expressed by a specific one, pistin, in Romans
   3:3, and by aletheia, in Romans 3:7. The idea is substantially the
   same, which is designated by these respectively corresponding
   appellations. Fidelity, uprightness, integrity, are designated by
   pistin, dikaiosunen, and aletheia; while aletheia, and apistia adikia,
   designate unfaithfulness, want of uprightness and false dealing. All of
   these terms have more or less reference to the vryt, covenant or
   compact (so to speak) which existed between God and his ancient
   people." -- Ed.

   [94] Grotius thinks, that in the beginning of this verse there is a
   transposition, and that hoti, after the parenthesis, ought to be
   construed before me which precedes it, and that hoti is for cur, why,
   -- as in Mark 9:11, and 28. The version would then be, "and why not,
   (as we are reproached, and as some declare that we say,) Let us do evil
   that good may come?" This is the rendering of Luther But Limborch and
   Stuart consider legomen to be understood after me; and the latter takes
   me not as a negative but an interrogative, "and shall we say," etc.?
   Amidst these varieties, the main drift of the passage remains the same.
   -- Ed.

   Romans 3:9

   9. What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have
   before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.

   9. Quid ergo? pr����cellimus? [95] Nequaquam: ante enim constituimus tam
   Jud����os quam Gr����cos, omnes sub peccato esse.

   9. What then? He returns from his digression to his subject. For lest
   the Jews should object that they were deprived of their right, as he
   had mentioned those distinctions of honor, for which they thought
   themselves superior to the Gentiles, he now at length replies to the
   question -- in what respect they excelled the Gentiles. And though his
   answer seems in appearance to militate against what he had said before,
   (for he now strips those of all dignity to whom he had attributed so
   much,) there is yet no discord; for those privileges in which he
   allowed them to be eminent, were separate from themselves, and
   dependent on God's goodness, and not on their own merit: but here he
   makes inquiry as to their own worthiness, whether they could glory in
   any respect in themselves. Hence the two answers he gives so agree
   together, that the one follows from the other; for while he extols
   their privileges, by including them among the free benefits of God, he
   shows that they had nothing of their own. Hence, what he now answers
   might have been easily inferred; for since it was their chief
   superiority, that God's oracles were deposited with them, and they had
   it not through their own merit, there was nothing left for them, on
   account of which they could glory before God. Now mark the holy
   contrivance (sanctum artificium) which he adopts; for when he ascribes
   pre-eminency to them, he speaks in the third person; but when he strips
   them of all things, he puts himself among them, that he might avoid
   giving offense.

   For we have before brought a charge, etc. The Greek verb which Paul
   adopts, aitiasthai is properly a forensic term; and I have therefore
   preferred to render it, "We have brought a charge;" [96] for an accuser
   in an action is said to charge a crime, which he is prepared to
   substantiate by testimonies and other proofs. Now the Apostle had
   summoned all mankind universally before the tribunal of God, that he
   might include all under the same condemnation: and it is to no purpose
   for any one to object, and say that the Apostle here not only brings a
   charge, but more especially proves it; for a charge is not true except
   it depends on solid and strong evidences, according to what Cicero
   says, who, in a certain place, distinguishes between a charge and a
   slander. We must add, that to be under sin means that we are justly
   condemned as sinners before God, or that we are held under the curse
   which is due to sin; for as righteousness brings with it absolution, so
   sin is followed by condemnation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [95] "Pr����cellimus?" proechometha; "Have we the advantage?" Doddridge;
   "Do we excel?" Macknight; "Have we any preference?" Stuart It is thus
   paraphrased by Theodoret ti oun katechomen perisson -- "What advantages
   then, have we?" "Pr����cellimus" is the rendering of Erasmus, Pareus, and
   Beza Venema says, that this verb, in the active voice only, has this
   meaning in Greek authors; but the context can allow it no other sense
   here. Wetstein indeed gives it a passive meaning, "an antecellimur --
   are we surpassed?" but it can hardly comport with the drift of the
   passage. -- Ed.

   [96] So do Grotius, Beza, and Stuart render the verb. Doddridge and
   Macknight have preserved our common version. "We have before charged,"
   Chalmers "Antea idoneis argumentis demonstravimus -- we have before
   proved by sufficient arguments." Schleusner It is charge rather than
   conviction that the verb imports, though the latter idea is also
   considered to be included. -- Ed.

   Romans 3:10-18

   10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

   10. Sicut scriptum, Quod non est justus quisquam, ne unus quidem;

   11. There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
   God.

   11. Non est intelligens, non est qui requirat Deum;

   12. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
   unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

   12. Omnes declinarunt, simul facti sunt inutiles; non est qui exerceat
   benignitatem, ne ad unum quidem:

   13. Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have
   used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

   13. Sepulchrum apertum guttur eorum; linguis dolose egerunt: venenum
   aspidum sub labiis eorum:

   14. Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

   14. Quorum os execratione et amarulentia plenum:

   15. Their feet are swift to shed blood:

   15. Veloces pedes eorum ad effundendum sanguinem;

   16. Destruction and misery are in their ways:

   16. Contritio et calamitas in viis eorum;

   17. And the way of peace have they not known:

   17. Et viam pacis non noverunt:

   18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

   18. Non est timor Dei pr���� oculis eorum. [97]

   10. As it is written, etc. He has hitherto used proofs or arguments to
   convince men of their iniquity; he now begins to reason from authority;
   and it is to Christians the strongest kind of proof, when authority is
   derived from the only true God. And hence let ecclesiastical teachers
   learn what their office is; for since Paul asserts here no truth but
   what he confirms by the sure testimony of Scripture, much less ought
   such a thing to be attempted by those, who have no other commission but
   to preach the gospel, which they have received through Paul and others.

   There is none righteous, etc. The Apostle, who gives the meaning rather
   than the entire words, seems, in the first place, before he comes to
   particulars, to state generally the substance of what the Prophet
   declares to be in man, and that is -- that none is righteous; [98] he
   afterwards particularly enumerates the effects or fruits of this
   unrighteousness.

   11. The first effect is, that there is none that understands: and then
   this ignorance is immediately proved, for they seek not God; for empty
   is the man in whom there is not the knowledge of God, whatever other
   learning he may possess; yea, the sciences and the arts, which in
   themselves are good, are empty things, when they are without this
   groundwork.

   12. It is added, [99] There is no one who doeth kindness By this we are
   to understand, that they had put off every feeling of humanity. For as
   the best bond of mutual concord among us is the knowledge of God, (as
   he is the common Father of all, he wonderfully unites us, and without
   him there is nothing but disunion,) so inhumanity commonly follows
   where there is ignorance of God, as every one, when he despises others,
   loves and seeks his own good.

   13. It is further added, Their throat is an open grave; [100] that is,
   a gulf to swallow up men. It is more than if he had said, that they
   were devourers (anthropophagous -- men-eaters;) for it is an intimation
   of extreme barbarity, when the throat is said to be so great a gulf,
   that it is sufficient to swallow down and devour men whole and entire.
   Their tongues are deceitful, and, the poison of asps is under their
   lips, import the same thing,

   14. Then he says, that their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
   [101] -- a vice of an opposite character to the former; but the meaning
   is, that they are in every way full of wickedness; for if they speak
   fair, they deceive and blend poison with their flatteries; but if they
   draw forth what they have in their hearts, bitterness and cursing
   stream out.

   16. Very striking is the sentence that is added from Isaiah, Ruin and
   misery are in all their ways; [102] for it is a representation of
   ferociousness above measure barbarous, which produces solitude and
   waste by destroying every thing wherever it prevails: it is the same as
   the description which Pliny gives of Domitian.

   17. It follows, The way of peace they have not known: they are so
   habituated to plunders, acts of violence and wrong, to savageness and
   cruelty, that they know not how to act kindly and courteously.

   18. In the last clause [103] he repeats again, in other words, what we
   have noticed at the beginning -- that every wickedness flows from a
   disregard of God: for as the principal part of wisdom is the fear of
   God, when we depart from that, there remains in us nothing right or
   pure. In short, as it is a bridle to restrain our wickedness, so when
   it is wanting, we feel at liberty to indulge every kind of
   licentiousness.

   And that these testimonies may not seem to any one to have been unfitly
   produced, let us consider each of them in connection with the passages
   from which they have been taken. David says in Psalm 14:1, that there
   was such perverseness in men, that God, when looking on them all in
   their different conditions, could not find a righteous man, no, not
   one. It then follows, that this evil pervaded mankind universally; for
   nothing is hid from the sight of God. He speaks indeed at the end of
   the Psalm of the redemption of Israel: but we shall presently show how
   men become holy, and how far they are exempt from this condition. In
   the other Psalms he speaks of the treachery of his enemies, while he
   was exhibiting in himself and in his descendants a type of the kingdom
   of Christ: hence we have in his adversaries the representatives of all
   those, who being alienated from Christ, are not led by his Spirit.
   Isaiah expressly mentions Israel; and therefore his charge applies with
   still greater force against the Gentiles. What, then? There is no doubt
   but that the character of men is described in those words, in order
   that we may see what man is when left to himself; for Scripture
   testifies that all men are in this state, who are not regenerated by
   the grace of God. The condition of the saints would be nothing better,
   were not this depravity corrected in them: and that they may still
   remember that they differ nothing from others by nature, they do find
   in the relics of their flesh (by which they are always encompassed) the
   seeds of those evils, which would constantly produce fruits, were they
   not prevented by being mortified; and for this mortification they are
   indebted to God's mercy and not to their own nature. We may add, that
   though all the vices here enumerated are not found conspicuously in
   every individual, yet they may be justly and truly ascribed to human
   nature, as we have already observed [2]on Romans 1:26.

   [97] The references given in the margin are these, -- Psalm 14:1-3;
   Psalm 53:3 Psalm 5:9; Psalm 14:3; Psalm 9:7; Isaiah 56:7; Proverbs
   1:16; Psalm 36:1.

   [98] Psalm 14:1. The Hebrew is, "There is none that doeth good;" and
   the Septuagint, "There is none doing kindness, (chrestoteta), there is
   not even one, (ouk estin heos henos.)" So that the Apostle quotes the
   meaning, not the words. The eleventh verse (Romans 3:11) is from the
   same Psalm; the Hebrew, with which the Septuagint agree, except that
   there is the disjunctive e between the participles, is the following,
   -- "Whether there is any one who understands, who seeks after God." --
   Ed.

   [99] This verse is literally the Septuagint, and as to meaning, a
   correct version of the Hebrew. "All have gone out of the way -- pantes
   exeklinan" "is in Hebrew hkl sr, "the whole (or every one) has turned
   aside," or revolted, or apostatized. Then, "they have become
   unprofitable" or useless, is n'lchv, "they are become putrid," or
   Corrupted, like putrified fruit or meat, therefore useless, not fit for
   what they were designed -- to serve God and to promote their own and
   the good of others. Idolatry was evidently this putrescence. -- Ed.

   [100] This is from Psalm 5:9, that is, the first part, and is literally
   the Septuagint, which correctly represents the Hebrew. The last clause
   is from Psalm 140:3, and is according to the Septuagint, and the
   Hebrew, too, except that "asps," or adders, is in the singular number.
   Stuart gives the import of this figurative language different from
   Calvin: "As from the sepulchre," he says, "issues forth an offensive
   and pestilential vapor; so from the mouths of slanderous persons issue
   noisome and pestilential words. Their words are like poison, they utter
   the poisonous breath of slander." -- Ed.

   [101] Psalm 10:7. Paul corrects the order of the words as found in the
   Septuagint, and gives the Hebrew more exactly, but retains the word
   "bitterness," by which the Septuagint have rendered mrmvt, which means
   deceit, or rather, mischievous deceit. Some think that it ought to be
   mrrvt, "bitterness;" but there is no copy in its favor. -- Ed.

   [102] Romans 3:15, 16, and 17 are taken from Isaiah 59:7, 8. Both the
   Hebrew and the Septuagint are alike, but Paul has abbreviated them, and
   changed two words in the Greek version, having put oxei' for tachinoi,
   and egnosan for oi'dasi, and has followed that version in leaving out
   "innocent" before "blood." -- Ed.

   [103] It is taken from Psalm 36:1, and verbatim from the Greek version,
   and strictly in accordance with the Hebrew. It is evident from several
   of these quotations, that Paul's object, as Calvin says, was to
   represent the general meaning, and not to keep strictly to the
   expressions. There is a difference of opinion as to the precise object
   of the Apostle; whether in these quotations he had regard to the Jews
   only, or to both Jews and Gentiles. In the introduction, Romans 3:9, he
   mentions both, and in the conclusion, Romans 3:19, he evidently refers
   to both, in these words, "that every, mouth may be stopped, and all the
   world may become guilty before God." The most consistent view seems to
   be, that the passages quoted refer both to Jews and Gentiles; the last,
   more especially, to the Jews, while some of the preceding have a
   special reference to the Gentile world, particularly Psalm 14, as it
   describes the character of the enemies of God and his people, to whose
   liberation the Psalmist refers in the last verse. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 3:19-20

   19. Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them
   who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the
   world may become guilty before God.

   19. Scimus autem quod qu����cunque Lex dicit, iis qui in Lege sunt
   loquitur; ut omne os obstruatur, et obnoxius fiat omnis mundus Deo.
   [104]

   20. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
   in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

   20. Quoniam ex operibus Legis non justificabitur omnis caro coram ipso;
   per Legem enim agnitio peccati.

   19. Now we know, etc. Leaving the Gentiles, he distinctly addresses his
   words to the Jews; for he had a much more difficult work in subduing
   them, because they, though no less destitute of true righteousness than
   the Gentiles, yet covered themselves with the cloak of God's covenant,
   as though it was a sufficient holiness to them to have been separated
   from the rest of the world by the election of God. And he indeed
   mentions those evasions which he well understood the Jews were ready to
   bring forward; for whatever was said in the law unfavorably of mankind,
   they usually applied to the Gentiles, as though they were exempt from
   the common condition of men, and no doubt they would have been so, had
   they not fallen from their own dignity. Hence, that no false conceit as
   to their own worthiness should be a hinderance to them, and that they
   might not confine to the Gentiles alone what applied to them in common
   with others, Paul here anticipates them, and shows, from what Scripture
   declares, that they were not only blended with the multitude, but that
   condemnation was peculiarly denounced on them. And we indeed see the
   discretion of the Apostle in undertaking to refute these objections;
   for to whom but to the Jews had the law been given, and to whose
   instruction but theirs ought it to have served? What then it states
   respecting others is as it were accidental; or as they say, parergon,
   an appendage; but it applies its teaching mainly to its own disciples.

   Under the law He says that the Jews were those to whom the law was
   destined, it hence follows, that it especially regards them; and under
   the word law he includes also the Prophets, and so the whole of the Old
   Testament -- That every mouth may be stopped, etc.; that is, that every
   evasion may be cut off, and every occasion for excuse. It is a metaphor
   taken from courts of law, where the accused, if he has anything to
   plead as a lawful defense, demands leave to speak, that he might clear
   himself from the things laid to his charge; but if he is convicted by
   his own conscience, he is silent, and without saying a word waits for
   his condemnation, being even already by his own silence condemned. Of
   the same meaning is this saying in Job 40:4, "I will lay my hand on my
   mouth." He indeed says, that though he was not altogether without some
   kind of excuse, he would yet cease to justify himself, and submit to
   the sentence of God. The next clause contains the explanation; for his
   mouth is stopped, who is so fast held by the sentence of condemnation,
   that he can by no means escape. According to another sense, to be
   silent before the Lord is to tremble at his majesty, and to stand mute,
   being astonished at his brightness. [105]

   20. Therefore by the works of the law, etc. It is a matter of doubt,
   even among the learned, what the works of the law mean. Some extend
   them to the observance of the whole law, while others confine them to
   the ceremonies alone. The addition of the word law induced Chrysostom,
   Origen, and Jerome to assent to the latter opinion; [106] for they
   thought that there is a peculiar intimation in this appendage, that the
   expression should not be understood as including all works. But this
   difficulty may be very easily removed: for seeing works are so far just
   before God as we seek by them to render to him worship and obedience,
   in order expressly to take away the power of justifying from all works,
   he has mentioned those, if there be any, which can possibly justify;
   for the law hath promises, without which there would be no value in our
   works before God. You hence see the reason why Paul expressly mentioned
   the works of the law; for it is by the law that a reward is apportioned
   to works. Nor was this unknown to the schoolmen, who held it as an
   approved and common maxim, that works have no intrinsic worthiness, but
   become meritorious by covenant. And though they were mistaken, inasmuch
   as they saw not that works are ever polluted with vices, which deprive
   them of any merit, yet this principle is still true, that the reward
   for works depends on the free promise of the law. Wisely then and
   rightly does Paul speak here; for he speaks not of mere works, but
   distinctly and expressly refers to the keeping of the law, the subject
   which he is discussing. [107]

   As to those things which have been adduced by learned men in defense of
   this opinion, they are weaker than they might have been. They think
   that by mentioning circumcision, an example is propounded, which
   belonged to ceremonies only: but why Paul mentioned circumcision, we
   have already explained; for none swell more with confidence in works
   than hypocrites, and we know that they glory only in external masks;
   and then circumcision, according to their view, was a sort of
   initiation into the righteousness of the law; and hence it seemed to
   them a work of primary excellence, and indeed the basis as it were of
   the righteousness of works. -- They also allege what is said in the
   Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul handles the same subject, and
   refers to ceremonies only; but that also is not sufficiently strong to
   support what they wish to defend. It is certain that Paul had a
   controversy with those who inspired the people with a false confidence
   in ceremonies; that he might cut off this confidence, he did not
   confine himself to ceremonies, nor did he speak specifically of what
   value they were; but he included the whole law, as it is evident from
   those passages which are derived from that source. Such also was the
   character of the disputation held at Jerusalem by the disciples.

   But we contend, not without reason, that Paul speaks here of the whole
   law; for we are abundantly supported by the thread of reasoning which
   he has hitherto followed and continues to follow, and there are many
   other passages which will not allow us to think otherwise. It is
   therefore a truth, which deserves to be remembered as the first in
   importance, -- that by keeping the law no one can attain righteousness.
   He had before assigned the reason, and he will repeat it presently
   again, and that is, that all, being to a man guilty of transgression,
   are condemned for unrighteousness by the law. And these two things --
   to be justified by works -- and to be guilty of transgressions, (as we
   shall show more at large as we proceed,) are wholly inconsistent the
   one with the other. -- The word flesh, without some particular
   specification, signifies men; [108] though it seems to convey a meaning
   somewhat more general, as it is more expressive to say, "All mortals,"
   than to say, "All men," as you may see in Gallius.

   For by the law, etc. He reasons from what is of an opposite character,
   -- that righteousness is not brought to us by the law, because it
   convinces us of sin and condemns us; for life and death proceed not
   from the same fountain. And as he reasons from the contrary effect of
   the law, that it cannot confer righteousness on us, let us know, that
   the argument does not otherwise hold good, except we hold this as an
   inseparable and unvarying circumstance, -- that by showing to man his
   sin, it cuts off the hope of salvation. It is indeed by itself, as it
   teaches us what righteousness is, the way to salvation: but our
   depravity and corruption prevent it from being in this respect of any
   advantage to us. It is also necessary in the second place to add this,
   -- that whosoever is found to be a sinner, is deprived of
   righteousness; for to devise with the sophisters a half kind of
   righteousness, so that works in part justify, is frivolous: but nothing
   is in this respect gained, on account of man's corruption.

   [104] Obnoxius Deo -- hupodikos to theo: "Obnoxius condemnationi Dei --
   subject to the condemnation of God" Beza; "Liable to punishment before
   God," Macknight; "Stand convicted before God," Doddridge The word means
   to be "under sentence" or under condemnation, and thus "to God," i.e.,
   before God. Tillotson gives this paraphrase, "Liable to the Divine
   justice." It may be rendered "condemned before God." The meaning is
   that the world is under condemnation. -- Ed.

   [105] To see the force and meaning of this verse, we must bear in mind
   that the former part was said to prevent the Jews from evading the
   application of the preceding testimonies; and then the words "that
   every mouth," etc., and "that all the world," etc., were added, not so
   much to include the Gentiles, as to include the Jews, who thought
   themselves exempted. No doubt the Gentiles are included, but the
   special object of the Apostle evidently seems to prevent the Jews from
   supposing that they were not included. In no other way can the
   connection between the two parts of the verse be understood. -- Ed.

   [106] The original is "ut in priorem opinionem concederent:" but the
   context shows clearly that "priorem" is a misprint for "posteriorem. In
   addition to the authors mentioned here may be added Ambrose, Theodoret,
   Pelagius, Erasmus, and Grotius And yet, notwithstanding all those
   authorities, the opinion referred to is wholly inconsistent with the
   reasoning of the Apostle here and throughout the whole Epistle. It has
   indeed been given up as untenable by modern authors of the same school,
   such as Locke, Whitby, and Macknight To disprove this notion it is
   sufficient to notice the sins which the Apostle had referred to; they
   are not those against the ceremonial but the moral law, and it is
   because the moral law is transgressed that it cannot justify. "If there
   be any law which man has perfectly kept, he may doubtless be justified
   by it; and surely no man can be justified by a law which condemns him
   for breaking it. But there is no law of God which any man has kept;
   therefore no law by the deeds of which a man can be justified. The
   Gentile broke the law of his reason and conscience; the Jew broke the
   moral law; and even the attempt to justify himself by observing the
   ceremonial law, contradicted the very nature and intent of it." --
   Scott

   [107] The argument and the reasoning of the Apostle seem to require
   that ex ergon nomou should be rendered here literally, "by works of
   law," without the article, as the word "law" seems here, according to
   the drift of the argument, to mean law in general, both natural and
   revealed; and dia nomou in the next clause must be regarded as having
   the same meaning; the law of nature as well as the written law, though
   not to the same extent, makes sin known. This is the view taken by
   Pareus, Doddridge, Macknight, Stuart, and Haldane. -- Ed.

   [108] The expression is ou pasa sarx -- not all, that is, not any
   flesh, etc.; the word pasa, like kl in Hebrew, is used here in the
   sense of "any." The sentence bears a resemblance to what is contained
   in Psalm 143:2, "for justified before thee shall not all living," or,
   not any one living, l' kl chy. The sentence here is literally, "Hence
   by works of law shall not be justified any flesh before Him." -- Ed.

   Romans 3:21-22

   21. But now the righteousness of God without the law [109] is
   manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

   21. Nunc autem sine Lege justitia Dei manifesto est, testimonio
   comprobata Legis et prophetarum;

   22. Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
   unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

   22. Justitia, inquam, Dei per fidem Iesu Christi, in omnes et super
   omnes credentes; non est san���� distinctio:

   21. But now without the law, etc. It is not certain for what distinct
   reason he calls that the righteousness of God, which we obtain by
   faith; whether it be, because it can alone stand before God, or because
   the Lord in his mercy confers it on us. As both interpretations are
   suitable, we contend for neither. This righteousness then, which God
   communicates to man, and accepts alone, and owns as righteousness, has
   been revealed, he says, without the law, that is without the aid of the
   law; and the law is to be understood as meaning works; for it is not
   proper to refer this to its teaching, which he immediately adduces as
   bearing witness to the gratuitous righteousness of faith. Some confine
   it to ceremonies; but this view I shall presently show to be unsound
   and frigid. We ought then to know, that the merits of works are
   excluded. We also see that he blends not works with the mercy of God;
   but having taken away and wholly removed all confidence in works, he
   sets up mercy alone.

   It is not unknown to me, that Augustine gives a different explanation;
   for he thinks that the righteousness of God is the grace of
   regeneration; and this grace he allows to be free, because God renews
   us, when unworthy, by his Spirit; and from this he excludes the works
   of the law, that is, those works, by which men of themselves endeavor,
   without renovation, to render God indebted to them. (Deum promereri --
   to oblige God.) I also well know, that some new speculators proudly
   adduce this sentiment, as though it were at this day revealed to them.
   But that the Apostle includes all works without exception, even those
   which the Lord produces in his own people, is evident from the context.

   For no doubt Abraham was regenerated and led by the Spirit of God at
   the time when he denied that he was justified by works. Hence he
   excluded from man's justification not only works morally good, as they
   commonly call them, and such as are done by the impulse of nature, but
   also all those which even the faithful can perform. [110] Again, since
   this is a definition of the righteousness of faith, "Blessed are they
   whose iniquities are forgiven," there is no question to be made about
   this or that kind of work; but the merit of works being abolished, the
   remission of sins alone is set down as the cause of righteousness.

   They think that these two things well agree, -- that man is justified
   by faith through the grace of Christ, -- and that he is yet justified
   by the works, which proceed from spiritual regeneration; for God
   gratuitously renews us, and we also receive his gift by faith. But Paul
   takes up a very different principle, -- that the consciences of men
   will never be tranquillized until they recumb on the mercy of God
   alone. [111] Hence, in another place, after having taught us that God
   is in Christ justifying men, he expresses the manner, -- "by not
   imputing to them their sins." In like manner, in his Epistle to the
   Galatians, he puts the law in opposition to faith with regard to
   justification; for the law promises life to those who do what it
   commands, (Galatians 3:12;) and it requires not only the outward
   performance of works, but also sincere love to God. It hence follows,
   that in the righteousness of faith, no merit of works is allowed. It
   then appears evident, that it is but a frivolous sophistry to say, that
   we are justified in Christ, because we are renewed by the Spirit,
   inasmuch as we are the members of Christ, -- that we are justified by
   faith, because we are united by faith to the body of Christ, -- that we
   are justified freely, because God finds nothing in us but sin.

   But we are in Christ because we are out of ourselves; and justified by
   faith, because we must recumb on the mercy of God alone, and on his
   gratuitous promises; and freely, because God reconciles us to himself
   by burying our sins. Nor can this indeed be confined to the
   commencement of justification, as they dream; for this definition --
   "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven" -- was applicable to
   David, after he had long exercised himself in the service of God; and
   Abraham, thirty years after his call, though a remarkable example of
   holiness, had yet no works for which he could glory before God, and
   hence his faith in the promise was imputed to him for righteousness;
   and when Paul teaches us that God justifies men by not imputing their
   sins, he quotes a passage, which is daily repeated in the Church. Still
   more, the conscience, by which we are disturbed on the score of works,
   performs its office, not for one day only, but continues to do so
   through life. It hence follows that we cannot remain, even to death, in
   a justified state, except we look to Christ only, in whom God has
   adopted us, and regards us now as accepted. Hence also is their
   sophistry confuted, who falsely accuse us of asserting, that according
   to Scripture we are justified by faith only, while the exclusive word
   only, is nowhere to be found in Scripture. But if justification depends
   not either on the law, or on ourselves, why should it not be ascribed
   to mercy alone? and if it be from mercy only, it is then by faith only.

   The particle now may be taken adversatively, and not with reference to
   time; as we often use now for but. [112] But if you prefer to regard it
   as an adverb of time, I willingly admit it, so that there may be no
   room to suspect an evasion; yet the abrogation of ceremonies alone is
   not to be understood; for it was only the design of the Apostle to
   illustrate by a comparison the grace by which we excel the fathers.
   Then the meaning is, that by the preaching of the gospel, after the
   appearance of Christ in the flesh, the righteousness of faith was
   revealed. It does not, however, hence follow, that it was hid before
   the coming of Christ; for a twofold manifestation is to be here
   noticed: the first in the Old Testament, which was by the word and
   sacraments; the other in the New, which contains the completion of
   ceremonies and promises, as exhibited in Christ himself: and we may
   add, that by the gospel it has received a fuller brightness.

   Being proved [or approved] by the testimony, [113] etc. He adds this,
   lest in the conferring of free righteousness the gospel should seem to
   militate against the law. As then he has denied that the righteousness
   of faith needs the aid of the law, so now he asserts that it is
   confirmed by its testimony. If then the law affords its testimony to
   gratuitous righteousness, it is evident that the law was not given for
   this end, to teach men how to obtain righteousness by works. Hence they
   pervert it, who turn it to answer any purpose of this kind. And
   further, if you desire a proof of this truth, examine in order the
   chief things taught by Moses, and you will find that man, being cast
   from the kingdom of God, had no other restoration from the beginning
   than that contained in the evangelical promises through the blessed
   seed, by whom, as it had been foretold, the serpent's head was to be
   bruised, and through whom a blessing to the nations had been promised:
   you will find in the commandments a demonstration of your iniquity, and
   from the sacrifices and oblations you may learn that satisfaction and
   cleansing are to be obtained in Christ alone. [114] When you come to
   the Prophets you will find the clearest promises of gratuitous mercy.
   On this subject see my Institutes.

   22. Even the righteousness of God, etc. [115] He shows in few words
   what this justification is, even that which is found in Christ and is
   apprehended by faith. At the same time, by introducing again the name
   of God, he seems to make God the founder, (autorem, the author,) and
   not only the approver of the righteousness of which he speaks; as
   though he had said, that it flows from him alone, or that its origin is
   from heaven, but that it is made manifest to us in Christ.

   When therefore we discuss this subject, we ought to proceed in this
   way: First, the question respecting our justification is to be
   referred, not to the judgment of men, but to the judgment of God,
   before whom nothing is counted righteousness, but perfect and absolute
   obedience to the law; which appears clear from its promises and
   threatenings: if no one is found who has attained to such a perfect
   measure of holiness, it follows that all are in themselves destitute of
   righteousness. Secondly, it is necessary that Christ should come to our
   aid; who, being alone just, can render us just by transferring to us
   his own righteousness. You now see how the righteousness of faith is
   the righteousness of Christ. When therefore we are justified, the
   efficient cause is the mercy of God, the meritorious is Christ, the
   instrumental is the word in connection with faith. [116] Hence faith is
   said to justify, because it is the instrument by which we receive
   Christ, in whom righteousness is conveyed to us. Having been made
   partakers of Christ, we ourselves are not only just, but our works also
   are counted just before God, and for this reason, because whatever
   imperfections there may be in them, are obliterated by the blood of
   Christ; the promises, which are conditional, are also by the same grace
   fulfilled to us; for God rewards our works as perfect, inasmuch as
   their defects are covered by free pardon.

   Unto all and upon all, [117] etc. For the sake of amplifying, he
   repeats the same thing in different forms; it was, that he might more
   fully express what we have already heard, that faith alone is required,
   that the faithful are not distinguished by external marks, and that
   hence it matters not whether they be Gentiles or Jews.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [109] Here again it is better, and indeed necessary for the Apostle's
   argument, to render choris nomou, ""without law," that is, without any
   law, either natural or revealed. The same sentiment is found in
   Galatians 3:21 -- "For if a law had been given, capable of giving life,
   truly righteous would have been by law (ek nomou.)" The version of
   Macknight seems just, "But now a righteousness of God without law is
   discovered." But we, may retain the tense (pephanerotai) "has been
   discovered," or manifested, or made known. "A righteousness of God
   without law," is a similar phrase to "the righteousness of God by
   faith," in Romans 1:17. -- Then in the following clause the "law" means
   not specifically the law of Moses, but the Old Testament, excepting the
   Prophets. -- Ed.

   [110] Professor Hodge very justly observes, "It never was the doctrine
   of the Reformation, or of the Lutheran and Calvinistic divines, that
   the imputation of righteousness affected the moral character of those
   concerned. It is true," he adds, "whom God justifies he also
   sanctifies; but justification is not sanctification, and the imputation
   of righteousness is not the infusion of righteousness." -- Ed.

   [111] "The foundation of your trust before God, must be either your own
   righteousness out and out, or the righteousness of Christ out and out.
   ... If you are to lean upon your own merit, lean upon it wholly -- if
   you are to lean upon Christ, lean upon him wholly. The two will not
   amalgamate together, and it is the attempt to do so, which keeps many a
   weary and heavy-laden inquirer at a distance from rest, and at a
   distance from the truth of the gospel. Maintain a clear and consistent
   posture. Stand not before God with one foot upon a rock and the other
   upon a treacherous quicksand...We call upon you not to lean so much as
   the weight of one grain or scruple of your confidence upon your own
   doings -- to leave this ground entirely, and to come over entirely to
   the ground of a Redeemer's blood and a Redeemer's righteousness." --
   Dr. Chalmers

   [112] "The words but now may be regarded merely as marking the
   transition from one paragraph to another, or as a designation of tense;
   now, i.e., under the gospel dispensation. In favor of this view is the
   phrase, "to declare at this time his righteousness, Romans 3:26." --
   Hodge

   [113] "Testimonio comprobata," etc., so Beza and Pareus render
   marturoumene; "Being attested," Doddridge; "Being testified," Macknight
   Schleusner gives a paraphrase, "Being predicted and promised;" and this
   no doubt is the full meaning. -- Ed.

   [114] Concurrent with what is said here is this striking and condensed
   passage from Scott, -- "It has been witnessed by the law and the
   Prophets; the ceremonies typified it; the very strictness of the moral
   law and its awful curses, being compared with the promises of mercy to
   sinners, implied it; the promises and predictions of the Messiah bore
   witness to it; the faith and hope of ancient believers recognized it;
   and the whole Old Testament, rightly understood, taught men to expect
   and depend on it." -- Ed.

   [115] The words which follow, dia pisteos Iesou Christou "by or through
   the faith of Jesus Christ," mean not the faith which is his, but the
   faith of which he is the object. They ought to be rendered "through
   faith in Jesus Christ." The genitive case has often this meaning:
   "Echete pistin Theou -- Have faith in (of) God," Mark 11:22; "En pistei
   zo tHu tou huiou tou Theou -- I live by the faith of the Son of God;"
   [Galations 2:20;] it should be in our language, "I live by faith in the
   Son of God." This genitive case of the object is an Hebraism, and is of
   frequent occurrence. -- Ed.

   [116] The original is this, "Ut ergo justificemur, causa efficiens est
   misericordia Dei, Christus materia, verbum cum fide instrumentum --
   When therefore we are justified, the efficient cause is God's mercy,
   Christ is the material, the word with faith is the instrument." -- Ed.

   [117] Eis pantas kai epi pantas. He makes a similar difference in his
   expressions in verse 30. This righteousness, as some say, came to the
   Jews, as it had been promised to them, and upon the Gentiles, as a gift
   with which they were not acquainted, and it was conferred on them. But
   the possession was equal and belonged to all who believed, and to none
   else, whether Jews or Gentiles. Stuart connects these words with
   "manifested," or revealed, in verse 21. It is manifested to all, and
   manifested for all; that is, for the real benefit of all who believe;
   in other words, it is offered to all, but becomes of real advantage
   only to those who believe. But the simpler mode is to consider the
   words, which is, as in our version, to be understood. Erchomene is the
   word which Luther adopts. -- Ed.

   Romans 3:23-26

   23. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

   23. Omnes enim peccaverunt, et destituuntur gloria Dei;

   24. Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is
   in Christ Jesus:

   24. Justificati gratis ipsius gratia per redemptionem qu���� est in
   Christo lesu:

   25. Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
   blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are
   past, through the forbearance of God;

   25. Quem proposuit Deus propitiatorium per fidem in sanguine ipsius, in
   demonstrationem justitiae su����, propter remissionem delictorum,

   26. To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be
   just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

   26. Qu���� prius extiterunt in tolerantia Dei; ad demonstrationem
   justitiae suae, in hoc tempore; ut sit ipse justus et Justificans enum
   qui est ex fide Iesu.

   23. There is indeed no difference, etc. He urges on all, without
   exception, the necessity of seeking righteousness in Christ; as though
   he had said, "There is no other way of attaining righteousness; for
   some cannot be justified in this and others in that way; but all must
   alike be justified by faith, because all are sinners, and therefore
   have nothing for which they can glory before God." But he takes as
   granted that every one, conscious of his sin, when he comes before the
   tribunal of God, is confounded and lost under a sense of his own shame;
   so that no sinner can bear the presence of God, as we see an example in
   the case of Adam. He again brings forward a reason taken from the
   opposite side; and hence we must notice what follows. Since we are all
   sinners, Paul concludes, that we are deficient in, or destitute of, the
   praise due to righteousness. There is then, according to what he
   teaches, no righteousness but what is perfect and absolute. Were there
   indeed such a thing as half righteousness, it would yet be necessary to
   deprive the sinner entirely of all glory: and hereby the figment of
   partial righteousness, as they call it, is sufficiently confuted; for
   if it were true that we are justified in part by works, and in part by
   grace, this argument of Paul would be of no force -- that all are
   deprived of the glory of God because they are sinners. It is then
   certain, there is no righteousness where there is sin, until Christ
   removes the curse; and this very thing is what is said in Galatians
   3:10, that all who are under the law are exposed to the curse, and that
   we are delivered from it through the kindness of Christ. The glory of
   God I take to mean the approbation of God, as in John 12:43, where it
   is said, that "they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God."
   And thus he summons us from the applause of a human court to the
   tribunal of heaven. [118]

   24. Being justified freely, etc. A participle is here put for a verb
   according to the usage of the Greek language. The meaning is, -- that
   since there remains nothing for men, as to themselves, but to perish,
   being smitten by the just judgment of God, they are to be justified
   freely through his mercy; for Christ comes to the aid of this misery,
   and communicates himself to believers, so that they find in him alone
   all those things in which they are wanting. There is, perhaps, no
   passage in the whole Scripture which illustrates in a more striking
   manner the efficacy of his righteousness; for it shows that God's mercy
   is the efficient cause, that Christ with his blood is the meritorious
   cause, that the formal or the instumental cause is faith in the word,
   and that moreover, the final cause is the glory of the divine justice
   and goodness.

   With regard to the efficient cause, he says, that we are justified
   freely, and further, by his grace; and he thus repeats the word to show
   that the whole is from God, and nothing from us. It might have been
   enough to oppose grace to merits; but lest we should imagine a half
   kind of grace, he affirms more strongly what he means by a repetition,
   and claims for God's mercy alone the whole glory of our righteousness,
   which the sophists divide into parts and mutilate, that they may not be
   constrained to confess their own poverty. -- Through the redemption,
   etc. This is the material, -- Christ by his obedience satisfied the
   Father's justice, (judicium -- judgment,) and by undertaking our cause
   he liberated us from the tyranny of death, by which we were held
   captive; as on account of the sacrifice which he offered is our guilt
   removed. Here again is fully confuted the gloss of those who make
   righteousness a quality; for if we are counted righteous before God,
   because we are redeemed by a price, we certainly derive from another
   what is not in us. And Paul immediately explains more clearly what this
   redemption is, and what is its object, which is to reconcile us to God;
   for he calls Christ a propitiation, (or, if we prefer an allusion to an
   ancient type,) a propitiatory. But what he means is, that we are not
   otherwise just than through Christ propitiating the Father for us. But
   it is necessary for us to examine the words. [119]

   25. Whom God hath set forth, etc. The Greek verb, protithenai, means
   sometimes to determine beforehand, and sometimes to set forth. If the
   first meaning be taken, Paul refers to the gratuitous mercy of God, in
   having appointed Christ as our Mediator, that he might appease the
   Father by the sacrifice of his death: nor is it a small commendation of
   God's grace that he, of his own good will, sought out a way by which he
   might remove our curse. According to this view, the passage fully
   harmonizes with that in John 3:16,

   "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son."

   Yet if we embrace this meaning, it will remain still true, that God
   hath set him forth in due time, whom he had appointed as a Mediator.
   There seems to be an allusion in the word, hilasterion, as I have said,
   to the ancient propitiatory; for he teaches us that the same thing was
   really exhibited in Christ, which had been previously typified. As,
   however, the other view cannot be disproved, should any prefer it, I
   shall not undertake to decide the question. What Paul especially meant
   here is no doubt evident from his words; and it was this, -- that God,
   without having regard to Christ, is always angry with us, -- and that
   we are reconciled to him when we are accepted through his
   righteousness. God does not indeed hate in us his own workmanship, that
   is, as we are formed men; but he hates our uncleanness, which has
   extinguished the light of his image. When the washing of Christ
   cleanses this away, he then loves and embraces us as his own pure
   workmanship.

   A propitiatory through faith in his blood, etc. I prefer thus literally
   to retain the language of Paul; for it seems indeed to me that he
   intended, by one single sentence, to declare that God is propitious to
   us as soon as we have our trust resting on the blood of Christ; for by
   faith we come to the possession of this benefit. But by mentioning
   blood only, he did not mean to exclude other things connected with
   redemption, but, on the contrary, to include the whole under one word:
   and he mentioned "blood," because by it we are cleansed. Thus, by
   taking a part for the whole, he points out the whole work of expiation.
   For, as he had said before, that God is reconciled in Christ, so he now
   adds, that this reconciliation is obtained by faith, mentioning, at the
   same time, what it is that faith ought mainly to regard in Christ --
   his blood.

   For (propter) the remission of sins, [120] etc. The causal preposition
   imports as much as though he had said, "for the sake of remission," or,
   "to this end, that he might blot out sins." And this definition or
   explanation again confirms what I have already often reminded you, --
   that men are pronounced just, not because they are such in reality, but
   by imputation: for he only uses various modes of expression, that he
   might more clearly declare, that in this righteousness there is no
   merit of ours; for if we obtain it by the remission of sins, we
   conclude that it is not from ourselves; and further, since remission
   itself is an act of God's bounty alone, every merit falls to the
   ground.

   It may, however, be asked, why he confines pardon to preceding sins?
   Though this passage is variously explained, yet it seems to me probable
   that Paul had regard to the legal expiations, which were indeed
   evidences of a future satisfaction, but could by no means pacify God.
   There is a similar passage in Hebrews 9:15, where it is said, that by
   Christ a redemption was brought from sins, which remained under the
   former Testament. You are not, however, to understand that no sins but
   those of former times were expiated by the death of Christ -- a
   delirious notion, which some fanatics have drawn from a distorted view
   of this passage. For Paul teaches us only this, -- that until the death
   of Christ there was no way of appeasing God, and that this was not done
   or accomplished by the legal types: hence the reality was suspended
   until the fullness of time came. We may further say, that those things
   which involve us daily in guilt must be regarded in the same light; for
   there is but one true expiation for all.

   Some, in order to avoid what seems inconsistent, have held that former
   sins are said to have been forgiven, lest there should seem to he a
   liberty given to sin in future. It is indeed true that no pardon is
   offered but for sins committed; not that the benefit of redemption
   fails or is lost, when we afterwards fall, as Novatus and his sect
   dreamed, but that it is the character of the dispensation of the
   gospel, to set before him who will sin the judgment and wrath of God,
   and before the sinner his mercy. But what I have already stated is the
   real sense.

   He adds, that this remission was through forbearance; and this I take
   simply to mean gentleness, which has stayed the judgment of God, and
   suffered it not to burst forth to our ruin, until he had at length
   received us into favor. But there seems to be here also an implied
   anticipation of what might be said; that no one might object, and say
   that this favor had only of late appeared. Paul teaches us, that it was
   an evidence of forbearance.

   26. For a demonstration, [121] etc. The repetition of this clause is
   emphatical; and Paul resignedly made it, as it was very needful; for
   nothing is more difficult than to persuade man that he ought to
   disclaim all things as his own, and to ascribe them all to God. At the
   same time mention was intentionally made twice of this demonstration,
   that the Jews might open their eyes to behold it. -- At this time, etc.
   What had been ever at all times, he applies to the time when Christ was
   revealed, and not without reason; for what was formerly known in an
   obscure manner under shadows, God openly manifested in his Son. So the
   coming of Christ was the time of his good pleasure, and the day of
   salvation. God had indeed in all ages given some evidence of his
   righteousness; but it appeared far brighter when the sun of
   righteousness shone. Noticed, then, ought to be the comparison between
   the Old and the New Testament; for then only was revealed the
   righteousness of God when Christ appeared.

   That he might be just, etc. This is a definition of that righteousness
   which he has declared was revealed when Christ was given, and which, as
   he has taught us in the first chapter, is made known in the gospel: and
   he affirms that it consists of two parts -- The first is, that God is
   just, not indeed as one among many, but as one who contains within
   himself all fullness of righteousness; for complete and full praise,
   such as is due, is not otherwise given to him, but when he alone
   obtains the name and the honor of being just, while the whole human
   race is condemned for injustice: and then the other part refers to the
   communication of righteousness; for God by no means keeps his riches
   laid up in himself, but pours them forth upon men. Then the
   righteousness of God shines in us, whenever he justifies us by faith in
   Christ; for in vain were Christ given us for righteousness, unless
   there was the fruition of him by faith. It hence follows, that all were
   unjust and lost in themselves, until a remedy from heaven was offered
   to them. [122]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [118] Beza gives another view, that the verb husterountai, refers to
   those who run a race, and reach not the goal, and lose the prize. The
   "glory of God" is the happiness which he bestows; (see Romans 5:2;) of
   this all mankind come short, however much some seemed to labor for it;
   and it can only be attained by faith. Pareus, Locke, and Whitby give
   the same view. Others consider it to be "the glory" due to God, -- that
   all come short of rendering him the service and honor which he justly
   demands and requires. So Doddridge, Scott, and Chalmers But Melancthon,
   Grotius and Macknight seemed to have agreed with Calvin in regarding
   "glory" here as the praise or approbation that comes from God. The
   second view seems the most appropriate, according to what is said in
   Romans 1:21, "they glorified him not as God." -- Ed.

   [119] On this word hilasterion, both Venema, in his Notes on the
   Comment of Stephanus de Brais on this Epistle, and Professor Stuart,
   have long remarks. They both agree as to the meaning of the word as
   found in the Septuagint and in Greek authors, but they disagree as to
   its import here. It means uniformly in the Septuagint, the mercy-seat,
   kphrt, and, as it is in the form of an adjective, it has at least once,
   (Exodus 25:17,) epithema, cover, added to it. But in the classics it
   means a propitiatory sacrifice, the word thuma, a sacrifice, being
   understood; but it is used by itself as other words of similar
   termination are. It is found also in Josephus and in Maccabees in this
   sense. It appears that Origen, Theodoret, and other Fathers, and also
   Erasmus, Luther and Locke, take the first meaning -- mercy-seat; and
   that Grotius, Elsner, Turrettin, Bos, and Tholuck, take the second
   meaning -- a propitiatory sacrifice. Now as both meanings are
   legitimate, which of them are we to take? Venema, and Stuart allude to
   one thing which much favors the latter view, that is, the phrase en to
   haimati autou; and the latter says, that it would be incongruous to
   represent Christ himself as the mercy-seat, and to represent him also
   as sprinkled by his own blood; but that it is appropriate to say that a
   propitiatory sacrifice was made by his blood. The verb proetheto, set
   forth, it is added, seems to support the same view. To exhibit a
   mercy-seat is certainly not suitable language in this connection.
   Pareus renders it "placamentum -- atonement," hoc est, "placatorem,"
   that is, "atoner, or expiator." Beza's version is the same --
   "placamentum;" Doddridge has "propitiation," and Macknight, "a
   propitiatory," and Schleusner, "expiatorem -- expiator." The word
   occurs in one other place with the neuter article, to hilasterion,
   Hebrews 9:5, where it clearly means the mercy-seat. It is ever
   accompanied with the article in the Septuagint, when by itself, see
   Leviticus 16:2, 13-15; but here it is without the article, and may be
   viewed as an adjective dependent on, "whom," and rendered propitiator.
   Had the mercy-seat been intended, it would have been to hilasterion. --
   Ed.

   [120] The words are, dia ten paresin. They seem connected, not with the
   first clause, but with the one immediately preceding; and dia may be
   rendered here in; see a note on Romans 2:26; or more properly, perhaps,
   on account of. "For a proof of his own righteousness in passing by the
   sins," etc., Macknight; "In order to declare his justification with
   respect to the remission of sins," Stuart What is God's "righteousness"
   here has been variously explained. Some regard it his righteousness in
   fulfilling his promises, as Beza; others, his righteousness in Christ
   to believers, mentioned in chapter. 1:17, as Augustine; and others, his
   righteousness as the God of rectitude and justice, as Chrysostom Some,
   too, as Grotius, view it as meaning goodness or mercy, regarding the
   word as having sometimes this sense. It is the context that can help us
   to the right meaning. God exhibited his Son as a propitiation, to set
   forth this righteousness; and this righteousness is connected with the
   remission of, or rather; as the word means, the preterition of or
   connivance at sins committed under the old dispensation: and those sins
   were connived at through the forbearance of God, he not executing the
   punishment they deserved; and the purpose is stated to be, -- that God
   might be or appear just, while he is the justifier of those who believe
   in Christ. Now, what can this righteousness be but his administrative
   justice? As the law allowed no remission, and God did remit sins, there
   appeared to be a stain on divine justice. The exhibition of Christ as
   an atonement is what alone removes it. And there is a word in the
   former verse, as Venema justly observes, which tends to confirm this
   view, and that word is redemption, apolutrosis, which is a deliverance
   obtained by a ransom, or by a price, such as justice requires. Both
   Doddridge and Scott regard the passage in this light; and the latter
   gives the following version of it, -- "Whom God hath before appointed
   to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration
   of his justice, on account of the passing by of sins, that had been
   committed in former times, through the forbearance of God; I say, for a
   demonstration of his justice, in this present time, in order that he
   might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus." --
   Nothing can be clearer than this version. The last words are rightly
   rendered, though not literally; ton ek pisteos Iesou -- "him of the
   faith of Jesus," or, "him of faith in Jesus." Him of faith is him who
   believes, as tois houk ek peritomos -- "them not of circumcision" means
   "them who are not circumcised," Romans 4:12; and tois ex eritheias --
   "those of contention," signifies, "those who contend," or, are
   contentious, Romans 2:8. -- Ed.

   [121] There is a different preposition used here, pros, while eis is
   found in the preceding verse. The meaning seems to be the same, for
   both prepositions are used to designate the design, end, or object of
   any thing. This variety seems to have been usual with the Apostle;
   similar instances are found in Romans 3:22, as to eis and epi, and in
   Romans 3:30, as to ek and dia. "By both," says Wolfius, "the final
   cause (causa finalis) is indicated." Beza renders them both by the same
   preposition, ad, in Latin; and Stuart regards the two as equivalent.
   There is, perhaps, more refinement than truth in what Pareus says, --
   that eis intimates the proximate end -- the forgiveness of sins; and
   pros, the final end -- the glory of God in the exhibition of his
   justice as well as of his mercy. There is, at the same time, something
   in the passage which seems favorable to this view. Two objects are
   stated at the end of the passage, -- that God might appear just, and be
   also the justifier of such as believe. The last may refer to eis, and
   the former to pros; and this is consistent with the usual style of the
   Apostle; for, in imitation of the Prophets, where two things are
   mentioned in a former clause, the order is reversed in the second. --
   Ed.

   [122] A parallel passage to this, including the two verses, Romans 3:25
   and 26, is found in Hebrews 9:15; where a reference, as here, is made
   to the effect of Christ's death as to the saints under the Old
   testament. The same truth is implied in other parts of Scripture, but
   not so expressly declared. Stuart makes here an important remark --
   that if the death of Christ be regarded only as that of a martyr or as
   an example of constancy, how then could its efficacy be referred to
   "sins that are past?" In no other way than as a vicarious death could
   it possibly have any effect on past sins, not punished through God's
   forbearance. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 3:27-28

   27. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay:
   but by the law of faith.

   27. Ubi ergo gloriatio? [123] exclusa est. Per quam legem? operum?
   Nequaquam; Sed per legem fidei.

   28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
   deeds of the law.

   28. Constituimus ergo, fide justificari hominem sine operibus Legis.

   27. Where then is glorying? The Apostle, after having, with reasons
   abundantly strong, cast down men from their confidence in works, now
   triumphs over their folly: and this exulting conclusion was necessary;
   for on this subject, to teach us would not have been enough; it was
   necessary that the Holy Spirit should loudly thunder, in order to lay
   prostrate our loftiness. But he says that glorying is beyond all doubt
   excluded, for we cannot adduce anything of our own, which is worthy of
   being approved or commended by God. If the material of glorying be
   merit, whether you name that of congruity or of condignity, by which
   man would conciliate God, you see that both are here annihilated; for
   he treats not of the lessening or the modifying of merit, but Paul
   leaves not a particle behind. Besides, since by faith glorying in works
   is so taken away, that faith cannot be truly preached, without wholly
   depriving man of all praise by ascribing all to God's mercy -- it
   follows, that we are assisted by no works in obtaining righteousness.

   Of works? In what sense does the Apostle deny here, that our merits are
   excluded by the law, since he has before proved that we are condemned
   by the law? For if the law delivers us over to death, what glorying can
   we obtain from it? Does it not on the contrary deprive us of all
   glorying and cover us with shame? He then indeed showed, that our sin
   is laid open by what the law declares, for the keeping of it is what we
   have all neglected: but he means here, that were righteousness to be
   had by the law of works, our glorying would not be excluded; but as it
   is by faith alone, there is nothing that we can claim for ourselves;
   for faith receives all from God, and brings nothing except an humble
   confession of want.

   This contrast between faith and works ought to be carefully noticed:
   works are here mentioned without any limitation, even works
   universally. Then he neither speaks of ceremonies only, nor
   specifically of any external work, but includes all the merits of works
   which can possibly be imagined.

   The name of law is here, with no strict correctness, given to faith:
   but this by no means obscures the meaning of the Apostle; for what he
   understands is, that when we come to the rule of faith, the whole
   glorying in works is laid prostrate; as though he said -- "The
   righteousness of works is indeed commended by the law, but that of
   faith has its own law, which leaves to works, whatever they may be, no
   righteousness." [124]

   28. We then conclude, etc. He now draws the main proposition, as one
   that is incontrovertible, and adds an explanation. Justification by
   faith is indeed made very clear, while works are expressly excluded.
   Hence, in nothing do our adversaries labor more in the present day than
   in attempts to blend faith with the merits of works. They indeed allow
   that man is justified by faith; but not by faith alone; yea, they place
   the efficacy of justification in love, though in words they ascribe it
   to faith. But Paul affirms in this passage that justification is so
   gratuitous, that he makes it quite evident, that it can by no means be
   associated with the merit of works. Why he names the works of the law,
   I have already explained; and I have also proved that it is quite
   absurd to confine them to ceremonies. Frigid also is the gloss, that
   works are to be taken for those which are outward, and done without the
   Spirit of Christ. On the contrary, the word law that is added, means
   the same as though he called them meritorious; for what is referred to
   is the reward promised in the law. [125]

   What, James says, that man is not justified by faith alone, but also by
   works, does not at all militate against the preceding view. The
   reconciling of the two views depends chiefly on the drift of the
   argument pursued by James. For the question with him is not, how men
   attain righteousness before God, but how they prove to others that they
   are justified, for his object was to confute hypocrites, who vainly
   boasted that they had faith. Gross then is the sophistry, not to admit
   that the word, to justify, is taken in a different sense by James, from
   that in which it is used by Paul; for they handle different subjects.
   The word, faith, is also no doubt capable of various meanings. These
   two things must be taken to the account, before a correct judgment can
   be formed on the point. We may learn from the context, that James meant
   no more than that man is not made or proved to be just by a feigned or
   dead faith, and that he must prove his righteousness by his works. See

   [123] Gloriatio -- kauchesis -- glorying -- boasting or rejoicing. "The
   result of the gospel plan of salvation is to prevent all
   self-approbation, self-gratulation and exaltation on the part of the
   sinner." -- Hodge

   [124] Grotius explains "law" here by "vivendi regula" -- rule of
   living;" Beza, by "doctrina -- doctrine or teaching," according to the
   import of the word tvrh in Hebrew; and Pareus takes "the law of works,"
   metonymically, for works themselves, and "the law of faith," for faith
   itself; and he quotes these words of Theophylact, "The Apostle calls
   faith a law because the word, law, was in high veneration among the
   Jews." He uses the term, law, in a similar manner in Romans 8:2, "The
   law of the spirit of life," etc. "He calls here the gospel; the law of
   faith,' because faith is the condition of the gospel covenant, as
   perfect obedience was the condition of the covenant of nature and of
   that of Moses, (conditio foederis naturalis et foederis Mosaici.)" --

   [125] The phrase, choris ergon nomou, may be rendered, "without the

   well as Jews are here contemplated. -- Ed.

   Romans 3:29-30

   29. Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles?
   Yes, of the Gentiles also:

   29. Num Iud����orum Deus tantum? an non et Gentium? certe et Gentium.

   30. Seeing it is one God [126] which shall justify the circumcision by
   faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

   30. Quandoquidem unus Deus, qui justificabit circumcisionem ex fide, et
   Pr����putium per fidem.

   29. Is he the God of the Jews only? The second proposition is, that
   this righteousness belongs no more to the Jews than to the Gentiles:
   and it was a great matter that this point should be urged, in order
   that a free passage might be made for the kingdom of Christ through the
   whole world. He does not then ask simply or expressly, whether God was
   the Creator of the Gentiles, which was admitted without any dispute;
   but whether he designed to manifest himself as a Savior also to them.
   As he had put all mankind on a level, and brought them to the same
   condition, if there be any difference between them, it is from God, not
   from themselves, who have all things alike: but if it be true that God
   designs to make all the nations of the earth partakers of his mercy,
   then salvation, and righteousness, which is necessary for salvation,
   must be extended to all. Hence under the name, God, is conveyed an
   intimation of a mutual relationship, which is often mentioned in
   Scripture, --

   "I shall be to you a God, and you shall be to me a people." (Jeremiah
   30:22.)

   For the circumstance, that God, for a time, chose for himself a
   peculiar people, did not make void the origin of mankind, who were all
   formed after the image of God, and were to be brought up in the world
   in the hope of a blessed eternity.

   30. Who shall justify, [127] etc. In saying that some are justified by
   faith, and some through faith, he seems to have indulged himself in
   varying his language, while he expresses the same thing, and for this
   end, -- that he might, by the way, touch on the folly of the Jews, who
   imagined a difference between themselves and the Gentiles, though on
   the subject of justification there was no difference whatever; for
   since men became partakers of this grace by faith only, and since faith
   in all is the same, it is absurd to make a distinction in what is so
   much alike. I am hence led to think that there is something ironical in
   the words, as though be said, -- "If any wishes to have a difference
   made between the Gentile and the Jew, let him take this, -- that the
   one obtains righteousness by faith, and the other through faith."

   But it may be, that some will prefer this distinction, -- that the Jews
   were justified by faith, because they were born the heirs of grace, as
   the right of adoption was transmitted to them from the Fathers, -- and
   that the Gentiles were justified through faith, because the covenant to
   them was adventitious.

   [127] The future is used for the present -- "who justifies," after the
   manner of the Hebrew language, though some consider that the day of

   future tense. -- Ed.

   Romans 3:31

   31. Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we
   establish the law.

   31. Legem igitur irritam facimus per fidem? Ne ita sit: sed Legem
   stabilimus.


   31. Do we then make, etc. When the law is opposed to faith, the flesh
   immediately suspects that there is some contrariety, as though the one
   were adverse to the other: and this false notion prevails, especially
   among those who are imbued with wrong ideas as to the law, and leaving
   the promises, seek nothing else through it but the righteousness of
   works. And on this account, not only Paul, but our Lord himself, was
   evil spoken of by the Jews, as though in all his preaching he aimed at
   the abrogation of the law. Hence it was that he made this protest, --

   "I came not to undo, but to fulfill the law." (Matthew 5:17.)

   And this suspicion regards the moral as well as the ceremonial law; for
   as the gospel has put an end to the Mosaic ceremonies, it is supposed
   to have a tendency to destroy the whole dispensation of Moses. And
   further, as it sweeps away all the righteousness of works, it is
   believed to be opposed to all those testimonies of the law, by which
   the Lord has declared, that he has thereby prescribed the way of
   righteousness and salvation. I therefore take this defense of Paul, not
   only as to ceremonies, nor as to the commandments which are called
   moral, but with regard to the whole law universally. [128]

   For the moral law is in reality confirmed and established through faith
   in Christ, inasmuch as it was given for this end -- to lead man to
   Christ by showing him his iniquity; and without this it cannot be
   fulfilled, and in vain will it require what ought to be done; nor can
   it do anything but irritate lust more and more, and thus finally
   increase man's condemnation; but where there is a coming to Christ,
   there is first found in him the perfect righteousness of the law, which
   becomes ours by imputation, and then there is sanctification, by which
   our hearts are prepared to keep the law; it is indeed imperfectly done,
   but there is an aiming at the work. Similar is the case with
   ceremonies, which indeed cease and vanish away when Christ comes, but
   they are in reality confirmed by him; for when they are viewed in
   themselves they are vain and shadowy images, and then only do they
   attain anything real and solid, when their end is regarded. In this
   then consists their chief confirmation, when they have obtained their
   accomplishment in Christ. Let us then also bear in mind, so to dispense
   the gospel that by our mode of teaching the law may be confirmed; but
   let it be sustained by no other strength than that of faith in Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [128] The law here, no doubt means, the law of which mention is made in
   the preceding verses -- the law by the works of which we cannot be
   justified -- the law that is in this respect opposed to faith. To refer
   us for its meanng to Romans 3:20 and 21, as is done by Stuart, "is
   wholly unwarrantable," and to say that it means the Old Testament; for
   this is to separate it from it's immediate connection without any
   satisfactory reason. Besides, such an interpretation obliterates an
   important doctrine, that faith does not render void, or nullify the
   authority, the use and sanctions of the moral law but on the contrary,
   sustains and confirms them. Though it does what the law does not, and
   cannot do, inasmuch as it saves the sinner whom the law condemns; it
   yet effects this without relaxing or dishonoring the law, but in a way
   that renders it, if possible, more binding, and more honorable, and
   more illustrious. It only renders the passage more intricate to include
   the ceremonial law, (for that has more of faith than of law in it,) to
   which no reference is made in the context: but there seems to be no
   objection to include the law of conscience, as well as the written law;
   for faith confirms both, and the word "law," is here without the
   article, though this indeed of itself is not decisive. The moral law,
   then, as well as the law of conscience, is what is here intended: for
   the authority of both is confirmed and strengthened by faith. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:1-3

   1. What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the
   flesh, hath found?

   1. Quid ergo dicemus, invenisse Abraham patrem nostrum secundum carnem?

   2. For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory;
   but not before God.

   2. Si enim Abraham ex operibus justificatus est. habet quo glorietur,
   sed non apud Deum.

   3. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
   counted unto him for righteousness. [129]

   3. Quid enim Scripture dicit' Credidit Abraham Deo, et imputa tum est
   illi in justitiam.

   1. What then, etc. This is a confirmation by example; and it is a very
   strong one, since all things are alike with regard to the subject and
   the person; for he was the father of the faithful, to whom we ought all
   to be conformed; and there is also but one way and not many ways by
   which righteousness may be obtained by all. In many other things one
   example would not be sufficient to make a common rule; but as in the
   person of Abraham there was exhibited a mirror and pattern of
   righteousness, which belongs in common to the whole Church, rightly
   does Paul apply what has been written of him alone to the whole body of
   the Church, and at the same time he gives a check to the Jews, who had
   nothing more plausible to glory in than that they were the children of
   Abraham; and they could not have dared to claim to themselves more
   holiness than what they ascribed to the holy patriarch. Since it is
   then evident that he was justified freely, his posterity, who claimed a
   righteousness of their own by the law, ought to have been made silent
   even through shame.

   According to the flesh, etc. Between this clause and the word father
   there is put in Paul's text the verb heurekenai, in this order -- "What
   shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh?"
   On this account, some interpreters think that the question is -- "What
   has Abraham obtained according to the flesh?" If this exposition be
   approved, the words according to the flesh mean naturally or from
   himself. It is, however, probable that they are to be connected with
   the word father. [130] Besides, as we are wont to be more touched by
   domestic examples, the dignity of their race, in which the Jews took
   too much pride, is here again expressly mentioned. But some regard this
   as spoken in contempt, as they are elsewhere called the carnal children
   of Abraham, being not so spiritually or in a legitimate sense. But I
   think that it was expressed as a thing peculiar to the Jews; for it was
   a greater honor to be the children of Abraham by nature and descent,
   than by mere adoption, provided there was also faith. He then concedes
   to the Jews a closer bond of union, but only for this end -- that he
   might more deeply impress them that they ought not to depart from the
   example of their father.

   2. For if Abraham, etc. This is an incomplete argument, [131] which may
   be made in this form -- "If Abraham was justified by works, he might
   justly glory: but he had nothing for which he could glory before God;
   then he was not justified by works." Thus the clause but not before
   God, is the minor proposition; and to this must be added the conclusion
   which I have stated, though it is not expressed by Paul. He calls that
   glorying when we pretend to have anything of our own to which a reward
   is supposed to be due at God's tribunal. Since he takes this away from
   Abraham, who of us can claim for himself the least particle of merit?

   3. For what saith the Scripture? This is a proof of the minor
   proposition, or of what he assumed, when he denied that Abraham had any
   ground for glorying: for if Abraham was justified, because he embraced,
   by faith, the bountiful mercy of God, it follows, that he had nothing
   to glory in; for he brought nothing of his own, except a confession of
   his misery, which is a solicitation for mercy. He, indeed, takes it as
   granted, that the righteousness of faith is the refuge, and, as it
   were, the asylum of the sinner, who is destitute of works. For if there
   be any righteousness by the law or by works, it must be in men
   themselves; but by faith they derive from another what is wanting in
   themselves; and hence the righteousness of faith is rightly called
   imputative.

   The passage, which is quoted, is taken from Genesis 15:6; in which the
   word believe is not to be confined to any particular expression, but it
   refers to the whole covenant of salvation, and the grace of adoption,
   which Abraham apprehended by faith. There is, indeed, mentioned there
   the promise of a future seed; but it was grounded on gratuitous
   adoption: [132] and it ought to be observed, that salvation without the
   grace of God is not promised, nor God's grace without salvation; and
   again, that we are not called to the grace of God nor to the hope of
   salvation, without having righteousness offered to us.

   Taking this view, we cannot but see that those understand not the
   principles of theology, who think that this testimony recorded by
   Moses, is drawn aside from its obvious meaning by Paul: for as there is
   a particular promise there stated, they understand that he acted
   rightly and faithfully in believing it, and was so far approved by God.
   But they are in this mistaken; first, because they have not considered
   that believing extends to the whole context, and ought not to be
   confined to one clause. But the principal mistake is, that they begin
   not with the testimony of God's favor. But God gave this, to make
   Abraham more assured of his adoption and paternal favor; and included
   in this was eternal salvation by Christ. Hence Abraham, by believing,
   embraced nothing but the favor offered to him, being persuaded that it
   would not be void. Since this was imputed to him for righteousness, it
   follows, that he was not otherwise just, than as one trusting in God's
   goodness, and venturing to hope for all things from him. Moses does
   not, indeed, tell us what men thought of him, but how he was accounted
   before the tribunal of God. Abraham then laid hold on the benignity of
   God offered to him in the promise, through which he understood that
   righteousness was communicated to him. It is necessary, in order to
   form an opinion of righteousness, to understand this relation between
   the promise and faith; for there is in this respect the same connection
   between God and us, as there is, according to the lawyers, between the
   giver and the person to whom any thing is given, (datorem et donatarium
   -- the donor and the donee:) for we can no otherwise attain
   righteousness, than as it is brought to us, as it were, by the promise
   of the gospel; and we realize its possession by faith. [133]

   How to reconcile what James says, which seems somewhat contrary to this
   view I have already explained, and intend to explain more fully, when I
   come, if the Lord will permit, to expound that Epistle.

   Only let us remember this, -- that those to whom righteousness is
   imputed, are justified; since these two things are mentioned by Paul as
   being the same. We hence conclude that the question is not, what men
   are in themselves, but how God regards them; not that purity of
   conscience and integrity of life are to be separated from the
   gratuitous favor of God; but that when the reason is asked, why God
   loves us and owns us as just, it is necessary that Christ should come
   forth as one who clothes us with his own righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [129] This chapter, as Turrettin observes, divides itself into three
   parts. The first from 1 to 12 inclusive, the second from 13 to 17
   inclusive, in which it is proved that the promises made to Abraham did
   not depend on the law; and the third from 18 to the end, in which the
   faith of Abraham is commended, and the Christian faith briefly referred
   to. But Pareus makes a different division: 1, Four proofs of
   justification by faith, from 1 to 16; 2, The dispensation of Abraham,
   from 17 to 22; 3, The application of the subject, from 23 to 25. -- Ed.

   [130] So did all the fathers according to Pareus, and so does the
   Vulgate. But later commentators have taken the words as they stand, and
   with good reason, for otherwise the correspondence between this and the
   following verse would not be apparent. Beza, Hammond, and Macknight
   take the words in their proper order; and this is what is done by the
   Syriac and Arabic versions. Kata sarka is rendered by Grotius and
   Macknight, "by (per) the flesh. Some understand by the word "flesh,"
   circumcision, as Vatablus; others, natural powers, as Grotius But Beza
   and Hammond think that it is the same as what is meant "by works" in
   the next verse; and "flesh" evidently has this meaning: it signifies
   often the performance of what the law requires, the observance not only
   of ceremonial but also of moral duties. See Galatians 3:3; Galatians
   6:12; and especially Philippians 3:3, 4; where Paul gives up "all
   confidence in the flesh," and enumerates, among other things, his
   strict conformity to the law. -- Ed.

   [131] Epicheirema; in Greek epicheirema, an attempted but an unfinished
   process of reasoning. It is not necessary to introduce this sort of
   syllogism, it being not the character of Scripture nor of any other
   writing to discuss matters in this form. The word for "glorying" here,
   kauchema, is different from that in Romans 3:27, kauchesis, and means
   reason, ground, or cause for glorying, and is rendered by Grotius "unde
   laudem speret -- whereby he may hope for praise;" and by Beza and
   Piscator "unde glorietur -- whereby he may glory." To complete the
   following clause, most repeat the words echei kauchema -- "But he has
   no ground for glorying before God." Vatablus gives another meaning,
   "But not with regard to God," that is, with regard to what he has said
   in his word; and this view is confirmed by what immediately follows,
   "For what saith the Scripture?" In this case there is nothing
   understood. That pros theon is used in a similar manner, is evident
   from other passages: ta pros theon -- "things which pertain to God,"
   i.e., to God's work or service. See Hebrews 2:17; Hebrews 5:1. -- Ed.

   [132] The adoption is evidently included in the words, found in the
   first verse of this chapter, "I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
   reward." What follows is connected with this, and the promise of a
   numerous seed arose from what Abraham said respecting an heir. His
   believing then had an especial regard to the first promise, as the
   second, respecting his "seed," was only, as it were, an enlargement of
   the first, or an addition to it. -- Ed.

   [133] The foregoing observations contain a lucid and a satisfactory
   view of the character of Abraham's faith, perfectly consistent with
   what is said of it by Paul in this chapter, and in the epistle to the
   Galatians. Some think that the principle of faith was the only thing
   which the Apostle had in view in referring to Abraham's faith, and that
   he had no special regard to the object of justifying faith, that is,
   Christ. But that Christ was, in a measure, revealed to him, is evident
   from the account given in Genesis, and from what Christ himself has
   said, -- that Abraham saw his day and rejoiced, John 8:56. At the same
   time it was the promise of gratuitous mercy, as Calvin intimates, that
   formed the most distinctive object of Abraham's faith, the promise of a
   free acceptance, without any regard to works. There are two things
   which the Apostle clearly intended to show, -- that imputation of
   righteousness is an act of gratuitous favor, -- and that it is alone by
   faith. There is some difference in the wording, though not in the
   meaning, of the sentence from Genesis 15:6. Paul gives it literally
   according to the Septuagint. The word "Abraham," is put in; instead of
   "Jehovah," it is "God;" the verb "count," is made passive, and a
   preposition is placed before "righteousness." The Hebrew is this, --
   "And he believed on Jehovah, and he counted it to him righteousness."
   The "it," no doubt, refers to what is included in the word "believed."
   So Paul explains it in verse 9, where he expressly puts down pistis,
   faith. It has been said that this faith of Abraham was not faith in
   Christ, according to what the context shows in Genesis. And it was not
   so specifically: nor does Paul represent it as such; for this was not
   his object. He states it throughout as faith in God; it was believing
   the testimony of God; but that testimony embraced a promise respecting
   Christ; so that it included the Savior within its compass. We must
   remember that Paul's object is to establish this truth, -- that
   righteousness is attained by faith and not by works; and that for this
   end he adduces the examples both of Abraham and David. It was not his
   design to point out specifically the object of justifying faith. We
   must keep this in view, in order to understand the reasoning of the
   Apostle in this chapter: it is the power and efficacy of faith, in
   opposition to all works, that he particularly dwells upon, and the
   gracious promise of God was its object. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:4-5

   4. Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of
   debt.

   4. Ei quidem qui operatur merces non imputatur secundum gratiam, sed
   secundum debitum:

   5. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
   the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

   5. Ei vero qui non operatur, credit autem in eum qui justificat impium,
   imputatur fides sua in justitiam.

   4. To him indeed who works, etc. It is not he, whom he calls a worker,
   who is given to good works, to which all the children of God ought to
   attend, but the person who seeks to merit something by his works: and
   in a similar way he calls him no worker who depends not on the merit of
   what he does. He would not, indeed, have the faithful to be idle; but
   he only forbids them to be mercenaries, so as to demand any thing from
   God, as though it were justly their due.

   We have before reminded you, that the question is not here how we are
   to regulate our life, but how we are to be saved: and he argues from
   what is contrary, -- that God confers not righteousness on us because
   it is due, but bestows it as a gift. And indeed I agree with Bucer, who
   proves that the argument is not made to depend on one expression, but
   on the whole passage, and formed in this manner, "If one merits any
   thing by his work, what is merited is not freely imputed to him, but
   rendered to him as his due. Faith is counted for righteousness, not
   that it procures any merit for us, but because it lays hold on the
   goodness of God: hence righteousness is not due to us, but freely
   bestowed." For as Christ of his own good-will justifies us through
   faith, Paul always regards this as an evidence of our emptiness; for
   what do we believe, except that Christ is an expiation to reconcile us
   to God? The same truth is found in other words in Galatians 3:11, where
   it is said, "That no man is justified by the law, it is evident, for
   the just shall by faith live: but the law is not by faith; but he who
   doeth these things shall live in them." Inasmuch, then, as the law
   promises reward to works, he hence concludes, that the righteousness of
   faith, which is free, accords not with that which is operative: this
   could not be were faith to justify by means of works. -- We ought
   carefully to observe these comparisons, by which every merit is
   entirely done away.

   5. But believes on him, etc. This is a very important sentence, in
   which he expresses the substance and nature both of faith and of
   righteousness. He indeed clearly shews that faith brings us
   righteousness, not because it is a meritorious act, but because it
   obtains for us the favor of God. [134] Nor does he declare only that
   God is the giver of righteousness, but he also arraigns us of
   unrighteousness, in order that the bounty of God may come to aid our
   necessity: in short, no one will seek the righteousness of faith except
   he who feels that he is ungodly; for this sentence is to be applied to
   what is said in this passage, -- that faith adorns us with the
   righteousness of another, which it seeks as a gift from God. And here
   again, God is said to justify us when he freely forgives sinners, and
   favors those, with whom he might justly be angry, with his love, that
   is, when his mercy obliterates our unrighteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [134] Some have stumbled at this sentence, -- "his faith is counted for
   righteousness," and have misapplied it, as though faith were in itself
   the cause of righteousness, and hence a meritorious act, and not the
   way and means of attaining righteousness. Condensed sentences will not
   submit to the rules of logic, but must be interpreted according to the
   context and explanations elsewhere found. "His faith" means, no doubt,
   his faith in the Promise, or in God who promises, or in him who, as is
   said in this verse, "justifies the ungodly:" hence what is believed, or
   the object of faith, is what is counted for righteousness. This accords
   with the declarations, -- that "man is justified by faith," Romans
   3:28, and that "the righteousness of God" is "by faith," Romans 3:22.
   If by faith, then faith itself is not that righteousness. "Beware,"
   says Chalmers, "of having any such view of faith as will lead you to
   annex to it the kind of merit, or of claim, or of glorying under the
   gospel, which are annexed to works under the law. This, in fact, were
   just animating with a legal spirit the whole phraseology and doctrine
   of the gospel. It is God who justifies. He drew up the title-deed, and
   he bestowed the title-deed. It is ours simply to lay hold of it...Any
   other view of faith than that which excludes boasting must be
   altogether unscriptural." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:6-8

   6. Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom
   God imputeth righteousness without works,

   6. Quemadmodum etiam David finit beatudinem hominis cui Deus imputat
   justitiam absque operibus,

   7. Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
   sins are covered.

   7. Beati quorum remiss���� sunt iniquitates, et quorum tecta sunt peccata:

   8. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

   8. Beatus vir, cui non imputavit Dominus peccatum.

   6. As David also defines, etc. We hence see the sheer sophistry of
   those who limit the works of the law to ceremonies; for he now simply
   calls those works, without anything added, which he had before called
   the works of the law. Since no one can deny that a simple and
   unrestricted mode of speaking, such as we find here, ought to be
   understood of every work without any difference, the same view must be
   held throughout the whole argument. There is indeed nothing less
   reasonable than to remove from ceremonies only the power of justifying,
   since Paul excludes all works indefinitely. To the same purpose is the
   negative clause, -- that God justifies men by not imputing sin: and by
   these words we are taught that righteousness, according to Paul, is
   nothing else than the remission of sins; and further, that this
   remission is gratuitous, because it is imputed without works, which the
   very name of remission indicates; for the creditor who is paid does not
   remit, but he who spontaneously cancels the debt through mere kindness.
   Away, then, with those who teach us to redeem pardon for our sins by
   satisfactions; for Paul borrows an argument from this pardon to prove
   the gratuitous gift of righteousness. [135] How then is it possible for
   them to agree with Paul? They say, "We must satisfy by works the
   justice of God, that we may obtain the pardon of our sins:" but he, on
   the contrary, reasons thus, -- "The righteousness of faith is
   gratuitous, and without works, because it depends on the remission of
   sins." Vicious, no doubt, would be this reasoning, if any works
   interposed in the remission of sins.

   Dissipated also, in like manner, by the words of the Prophet, are the
   puerile fancies of the schoolmen respecting half remission. Their
   childish fiction is, -- that though the fault is remitted, the
   punishment is still retained by God. But the Prophet not only declares
   that our sins are covered, that is, removed from the presence of God;
   but also adds, that they are not imputed. How can it be consistent,
   that God should punish those sins which he does not impute? Safe then
   does this most glorious declaration remain to us -- "That he is
   justified by faith, who is cleared before God by a gratuitous remission
   of his sins." We may also hence learn, the unceasing perpetuity of
   gratuitous righteousness through life: for when David, being wearied
   with the continual anguish of his own conscience, gave utterance to
   this declaration, he no doubt spoke according to his own experience;
   and he had now served God for many years. He then had found by
   experience, after having made great advances, that all are miserable
   when summoned before God's tribunal; and he made this avowal, that
   there is no other way of obtaining blessedness, except the Lord
   receives us into favor by not imputing our sins. Thus fully refuted
   also is the romance of those who dream, that the righteousness of faith
   is but initial, and that the faithful afterwards retain by works the
   possession of that righteousness which they had first attained by no
   merits.

   It invalidates in no degree what Paul says, that works are sometimes
   imputed for righteousness, and that other kinds of blessedness are
   mentioned. It is said in Psalm 106:30-31, that it was imputed to
   Phinehas, the Lord's priest, for righteousness, because he took away
   reproach from Israel by inflicting punishment on an adulterer and a
   harlot. It is true, we learn from this passage, that he did a righteous
   deed; but we know that a person is not justified by one act. What is
   indeed required is perfect obedience, and complete in all its parts,
   according to the import of the promise, --

   "He who shall do these things shall live in them."
   (Deuteronomy 4:1.)

   How then was this judgment which he inflicted imputed to him for
   righteousness? He must no doubt have been previously justified by the
   grace of God: for they who are already clothed in the righteousness of
   Christ, have God not only propitious to them, but also to their works,
   the spots and blemishes of which are covered by the purity of Christ,
   lest they should come to judgment. As works, infected with no
   defilements, are alone counted just, it is quite evident that no human
   work whatever can please God, except through a favor of this kind. But
   if the righteousness of faith is the only reason why our works are
   counted just, you see how absurd is the argument, -- "That as
   righteousness is ascribed to works, righteousness is not by faith
   only." But I set against them this invincible argument, that all works
   are to be condemned as those of unrighteousness, except a man be
   justified solely by faith.

   The like is said of blessedness: they are pronounced blessed who fear
   the Lord, who walk in his ways, (Psalm 128:1,) who meditate on his law
   day and night, (Psalm 1:2:) but as no one doeth these things so
   perfectly as he ought, so as fully to come up to God's command, all
   blessedness of this kind is nothing worth, until we be made blessed by
   being purified and cleansed through the remission of sins, and thus
   cleansed, that we may become capable of enjoying that blessedness which
   the Lord promises to his servants for attention to the law and to good
   works. Hence the righteousness of works is the effect of the
   righteousness of God, and the blessedness arising from works is the
   effect of the blessedness which proceeds from the remission of sins.
   Since the cause ought not and cannot be destroyed by its own effect,
   absurdly do they act, who strive to subvert the righteousness of faith
   by works.

   But some one may say, "Why may we not maintain, on the ground of these
   testimonies, that man is justified and made blessed by works? for the
   words of Scripture declare that man is justified and made blessed by
   works as well as by faith." Here indeed we must consider the order of
   causes as well as the dispensation of God's grace: for inasmuch as
   whatever is declared, either of the righteousness of works or of the
   blessedness arising from them, does not exist, until this only true
   righteousness of faith has preceded, and does alone discharge all its
   offices, this last must be built up and established, in order that the
   other may, as a fruit from a tree, grow from it and flourish.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] Speaking of this righteousness, Pareus says, "It is not ours,
   otherwise God would not gratuitously impute it, but bestow it as a
   matter of right; nor is it a habit or quality, for it is without works,
   and imputed to the ungodly, who have habitually nothing but iniquities;
   but it is a gratuitous remission, a covering, a non-imputation of
   sins." It is a striking proof of what the Apostle had in view here,
   that he stop short and does not quote the whole verse from Psalm 32:2.
   He leaves out, "and in whose spirit there is no guile:" and why?
   Evidently because his subject is justification, and not sanctification.
   He has thus most clearly marked the difference between the two. Sins
   may be said to be "forgiven" or remitted, because they are debts, and
   "covered," because they are filthy and abominable in the sight of God:
   and they are said to be "not imputed," or not put to one's account, in
   order to convey an assurance, that they are wholly removed, and shall
   be no more remembered. -- Ed.

   Romans 4:9-10

   9. Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, [136] or
   upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to
   Abraham for righteousness.

   9. Beatudo ergo ista in circumcisionem modo, an et in pr����putium
   competit? Dicimus enim quod imputata fuit Abrah���� fides in justitiam.

   10. How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
   uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

   10. Quomodo igitur imputata fuit? In Circumcisione quum esset, an in
   pr����putio? Non in circumcisione, sed in pr����putio.

   9-10. As circumcision and uncircumcision are alone mentioned, some
   unwisely conclude, that the only question is, that righteousness is not
   attained by the ceremonies of the law. But we ought to consider what
   sort of men were those with whom Paul was reasoning; for we know that
   hypocrites, whilst they generally boast of meritorious works, do yet
   disguise themselves in outward masks. The Jews also had a peculiar way
   of their own, by which they departed, through a gross abuse of the law,
   from true and genuine righteousness. Paul had said, that no one is
   blessed but he whom God reconciles to himself by a gratuitous pardon;
   it hence follows, that all are accursed, whose works come to judgment.
   Now then this principle is to be held, that men are justified, not by
   their own worthiness, but by the mercy of God. But still, this is not
   enough, except remission of sins precedes all works, and of these the
   first was circumcision, which initiated the Jewish people into the
   service of God. He therefore proceeds to demonstrate this also.

   We must ever bear in mind, that circumcision is here mentioned as the
   initial work, so to speak, of the righteousness of the law: for the
   Jews gloried not in it as the symbol of God's favor, but as a
   meritorious observance of the law: and on this account it was that they
   regarded themselves better than others, as though they possessed a
   higher excellency before God. We now see that the dispute is not about
   one rite, but that under one thing is included every work of the law;
   that is, every work to which reward can be due. Circumcision then was
   especially mentioned, because it was the basis of the righteousness of
   the law.

   But Paul maintains the contrary, and thus reasons: "If Abraham's
   righteousness was the remission of sins, (which he safely takes as
   granted,) and if Abraham attained this before circumcision, it then
   follows that remission of sins is not given for preceding merits." You
   see that the argument rests on the order of causes and effects; for the
   cause is always before its effect; and righteousness was possessed by
   Abraham before he had circumcision.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [136] This "only" is not in the original, but is supplied by most
   commentators: yet it is not necessary, nor makes the meaning consistent
   with what follows in Romans 4:10. The Kai; in the next clause is
   omitted in many copies; but if retained, it will not alter the sense.
   We may render this part of the verse thus, "Came then this blessedness
   on the circumcision, or even on the uncircumcision?" Then in the tenth
   verse he answers in the negative, -- that it was not to Abraham while
   "in circumcision," but while he was a "in uncircumcision." The
   reference is evidently to the first state of things, to the case of
   Abraham himself. Abraham is supposed to have been justified by faith
   about fourteen years before he was circumcised. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:11-12

   11. And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
   righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that
   he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not
   circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

   11. Et signum accepit circumcisionis, sigillum justiti���� fidei qu����
   fuerat in pr����putio; ut esset pater omnium credentium per pr����putium, quo
   ipsis quoque imputetur justitia;

   12. And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
   circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our
   father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.

   12. Et pater circumcisionis, non iis qui sunt ex circumcisione tantum,
   sed qui insistunt vestigiis fidei, qu���� fuit in pr����putio patris nostri
   Abrah����.

   11. And he received the sign, etc. In order to anticipate an objection,
   he shows that circumcision was not unprofitable and superfluous, though
   it could not justify; but it had another very remarkable use, it had
   the office of sealing, and as it were of ratifying the righteousness of
   faith. And yet he intimates at the same time, by stating what its
   object was, that it was not the cause of righteousness, it indeed
   tended to confirm the righteousness of faith, and that already obtained
   in uncircumcision. He then derogates or takes away nothing from it.

   We have indeed here a remarkable passage with regard to the general
   benefits of sacraments. According to the testimony of Paul, they are
   seals by which the promises of God are in a manner imprinted on our
   hearts, (Dei promissiones cordibus nostris quodammodo imprimuntur,) and
   the certainty of grace confirmed (sancitur gratoe certitudo ) And
   though by themselves they profit nothing, yet God has designed them to
   be the instruments (instrumenta) of his grace; and he effects by the
   secret grace of his Spirit, that they should not be without benefit in
   the elect. And though they are dead and unprofitable symbols to the
   reprobate, they yet ever retain their import and character (vim suam et
   naturam:) for though our unbelief may deprive them of their effect, yet
   it cannot weaken or extinguish the truth of God. Hence it remains a
   fixed principle, that sacred symbols are testimonies, by which God
   seals his grace on our hearts.

   As to the symbol of circumcision, this especially is to be said, that a
   twofold grace was represented by it. God had promised to Abraham a
   blessed seed, from whom salvation was to be expected by the whole
   world. On this depended the promise -- "I will be to thee a God."
   (Genesis 17:7.) Then a gratuitous reconciliation with God was included
   in that symbol: and for this reason it was necessary that the faithful
   should look forward to the promised seed. On the other hand, God
   requires integrity and holiness of life; he indicated by the symbol how
   this could be attained, that is, by cutting off in man whatever is born
   of the flesh, for his whole nature had become vicious. He therefore
   reminded Abraham by the external sign, that he was spiritually to cut
   off the corruption of the flesh; and to this Moses has also alluded in
   Deuteronomy 10:16. And to show that it was not the work of man, but of
   God, he commanded tender infants to be circumcised, who, on account of
   their age, could not have performed such a command. Moses has indeed
   expressly mentioned spiritual circumcision as the work of divine power,
   as you will find in Deuteronomy 30:6, where he says, "The Lord will
   circumcise thine heart:" and the Prophets afterwards declared the same
   thing much more clearly.

   As there are two points in baptism now, so there were formerly in
   circumcision; for it was a symbol of a new life, and also of the
   remission of sins. But the fact as to Abraham himself, that
   righteousness preceded circumcision, is not always the case in
   sacraments, as it is evident from the case of Isaac and his posterity:
   but God intended to give such an instance once at the beginning, that
   no one might ascribe salvation to external signs. [137]

   That he might be the father, etc. Mark how the circumcision of Abraham
   confirms our faith with regard to gratuitous righteousness; for it was
   the sealing of the righteousness of faith, that righteousness might
   also be imputed to us who believe. And thus Paul, by a remarkable
   dexterity makes to recoil on his opponents what they might have adduced
   as an objection: for since the truth and import (veritas et vis) of
   circumcision were found in an uncircumcised state, there was no ground
   for the Jews to elevate themselves so much above the Gentiles.

   But as a doubt might arise, whether it behoves us, after the example of
   Abraham, to confirm also the same righteousness by the sign of
   circumcision, how came the Apostle to make this omission? Even because
   he thought that the question was sufficiently settled by the drift of
   his argument: for as this truth had been admitted, that circumcision
   availed only to seal the grace of God, it follows, that it is now of no
   benefit to us, who have a sign instituted in its place by our Lord. As
   then there is no necessity now for circumcision, where baptism is, he
   was not disposed to contend unnecessarily for that respecting which
   there was no doubt, that is, why the righteousness of faith was not
   sealed to the Gentiles in the same way as it was to Abraham. To believe
   in uncircumcision means, that the Gentiles, being satisfied with their
   own condition, did not introduce the seal of circumcision: and so the
   preposition dia, by is put for en, in [138]

   12. To them who are not, etc. The verb, are, is in this place to be
   taken for, "are deemed to be:" for he touches the carnal descendants of
   Abraham, who, having nothing but outward circumcision, confidently
   gloried in it. The other thing, which was the chief matter, they
   neglected; for the faith of Abraham, by which alone he obtained
   salvation, they did not imitate. It hence appears, how carefully he
   distinguished between faith and the sacrament; not only that no one
   might be satisfied with the one without the other, as though it were
   sufficient for justifying; but also that faith alone might be set forth
   as accomplishing everything: for while he allows the circumcised Jews
   to be justified, he expressly makes this exception -- provided in true
   faith they followed the example of Abraham; for why does he mention
   faith while in uncircumcision, except to show, that it is alone
   sufficient, without the aid of anything else? Let us then beware, lest
   any of us, by halving things, blend together the two modes of
   justification.

   What we have stated disproves also the scholastic dogma respecting the
   difference between the sacraments of the Old and those of the New
   Testament; for they deny the power of justifying to the former, and
   assign it to the latter. But if Paul reasons correctly, when he argues
   that circumcision does not justify, because Abraham was justified by
   faith, the same reason holds good for us, while we deny that men are
   justified by baptism, inasmuch as they are justified by the same faith
   with that of Abraham.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [137] The word "sign" in this passage, semeion, seems not to mean an
   outward token of something inward, but a mark, circumcision itself,
   which was imprinted, as it were, as a mark in the flesh. So Macknight
   renders it, "The mark of circumcision." That circumcision was a sign or
   a symbol of what was spiritual, is evident: but this is not what is
   taught here. Circumcision is expressly called "a token," or a sign, in
   Genesis 17:11; but it is said to have been "a token of the covenant,"
   that is, a proof and an evidence of it. The design of circumcision is
   expressed by the next word, sphragida -- seal. This sometimes signified
   the instrument, 1 Kings 21:8; and sometimes the impression, Revelation
   5:1: and the impression was used for various purposes, -- to close up a
   document, to secure a thing, and also to confirm an agreement. It is
   taken here in the latter sense; circumcision was a "seal," a
   confirmation, an evidence, a proof, or a pledge, "of the righteousness"
   obtained "by faith." We meet not with any distinct statement of this
   kind in Genesis: it is what the Apostle had gathered, and rightly
   gathered, from the account given us of what took place between God and
   Abraham. -- Ed.

   [138] See a similar instance in Romans 2:27. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:13

   13. For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not
   to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the
   righteousness of faith.

   13. Non enim per Legem promissio Abrah���� et semini ejus data est, ut
   esset h����res mundi; sed per justitiam fidei.

   13. For the promise, etc. He now more clearly sets the law and faith in
   opposition, the one to the other, which he had before in some measure
   done; and this ought to be carefully observed: for if faith borrows
   nothing from the law in order to justify, we hence understand, that it
   has respect to nothing else but to the mercy of God. And further, the
   romance of those who would have this to have been said of ceremonies,
   may be easily disproved; for if works contributed anything towards
   justification, it ought not to have been said, through the written law,
   but rather, through the law of nature. But Paul does not oppose
   spiritual holiness of life to ceremonies, but faith and its
   righteousness. The meaning then is, that heirship was promised to
   Abraham, not because he deserved it by keeping the law, but because he
   had obtained righteousness by faith. And doubtless (as Paul will
   presently show) consciences can then only enjoy solid peace, when they
   know that what is not justly due is freely given them. [139]

   Hence also it follows, that this benefit, the reason for which applies
   equally to both, belongs to the Gentiles no less than to the Jews; for
   if the salvation of men is based on the goodness of God alone, they
   check and hinder its course, as much as they can, who exclude from it
   the Gentiles.

   That he should be the heir of the world, [140] etc. Since he now speaks
   of eternal salvation, the Apostle seems to have somewhat unseasonably
   led his readers to the world; but he includes generally under this word
   world, the restoration which was expected through Christ. The chief
   thing was indeed the restoration of life; it was yet necessary that the
   fallen state of the whole world should be repaired. The Apostle, in
   Hebrews 1:2, calls Christ the heir of all the good things of God; for
   the adoption which we obtain through his favor restores to us the
   possession of the inheritance which we lost in Adam; and as under the
   type of the land of Canaan, not only the hope of a heavenly life was
   exhibited to Abraham, but also the full and complete blessing of God,
   the Apostle rightly teaches us, that the dominion of the world was
   promised to him. Some taste of this the godly have in the present life;
   for how much soever they may at times be oppressed with want, yet as
   they partake with a peaceable conscience of those things which God has
   created for their use, and as they enjoy through his mercy and
   good-will his earthly benefits no otherwise than as pledges and
   earnests of eternal life, their poverty does in no degree prevent them
   from acknowledging heaven, and the earth, and the sea, as their own
   possessions.

   Though the ungodly swallow up the riches of the world, they can yet
   call nothing as their own; but they rather snatch them as it were by
   stealth; for they possess them under the curse of God. It is indeed a
   great comfort to the godly in their poverty, that though they fare
   slenderly, they yet steal nothing of what belongs to another, but
   receive their lawful allowance from the hand of their celestial Father,
   until they enter on the full possession of their inheritance, when all
   creatures shall be made subservient to their glory; for both heaven and
   earth shall be renewed for this end, -- that according to their measure
   they may contribute to render glorious the kingdom of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [139] Critics have differed as to the disjunctive e, or, "or to his
   seed." Some think it is put for kai, and: but Pareus thinks that it has
   a special meaning, intended to anticipate an objection. The Jews might
   have said, "If the case with Abraham is as stated, it is not so with
   his seed who received the law." Yes, says Paul, there is no difference,
   "The promise to Abraham, or to his seed, to whom the law was actually
   given, was not by the law." Hammond renders the whole verse more
   literally than in our version, -- "The promise to Abraham or to his
   seed, that he should be the heir of the world, was not by the law, but
   through the righteousness of faith." -- Ed.

   [140] There is in Genesis no expression conveyed in these words; but
   the probability is, that he intended to express in another form what he
   distinctly quotes in Romans 4:17, "I have made thee a father of many
   nations." The word "father," in this case, has been commonly understood
   to mean a leader, a pattern, a model, an exemplar, a forerunner, as
   Abraham was the first believer justified by faith, of whom there is an
   express record. But the idea seems to be somewhat different. He was a
   father as the first possessor of an inheritance which was to descend to
   all his children. The inheritance was given him by grace through faith;
   it was to descend, as it were, to all his lawful posterity, to all his
   legitimate seed, that is, to all who possessed the like faith with
   himself. He is therefore called the father of many nations, because
   many nations would become his legitimate heirs by becoming believers;
   and in the same sense must be regarded the expression here, "the heir
   of the world;" he was the representative of all the believing world,
   and made an heir of an inheritance which was to come to the world in
   general, to the believing Jews and to the believing Gentiles. He was
   the heir, the first possessor, of what was to descend to the world
   without any difference. He was the heir of the world in the same sense
   as he was "the father of all who believe," as he is said to have been
   in verse eleventh. The inheritance was doubtless eternal life or the
   heavenly kingdom, the country above, of which the land of Canaan was a
   type and a pledge. See Hebrews 11:12, 13, 16. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:14-15

   14. For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and
   the promise made of none effect:

   14. Si enim ii qui sunt ex Lege h����redes sunt, exinanita est fides et
   abolita est promissio:

   15. Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no
   transgression.

   15. Nam Lex iram efficit; siquidem ubi non est Lex, neque etiam
   transgressio.

   14. For if they who are of the law, etc. He takes his argument from
   what is impossible or absurd, that the favor which Abraham obtained
   from God, was not promised to him through any legal agreement, or
   through any regard to works; for if this condition had been interposed
   -- that God would favor those only with adoption who deserved, or who
   performed the law, no one could have dared to feel confident that it
   belonged to him: for who is there so conscious of so much perfection
   that he can feel assured that the inheritance is due to him through the
   righteousness of the law? Void then would faith be made; for an
   impossible condition would not only hold the minds of men in suspense
   and anxiety, but fill them also with fear and trembling: and thus the
   fulfillment of the promises would be rendered void; for they avail
   nothing but when received by faith. If our adversaries had ears to hear
   this one reason, the contest between us might easily be settled.

   The Apostle assumes it as a thing indubitable, that the promises would
   by no means be effectual except they were received with full assurance
   of mind. But what would be the case if the salvation of men was based
   on the keeping of the law? consciences would have no certainty, but
   would be harassed with perpetual inquietude, and at length sink in
   despair; and the promise itself, the fulfillment of which depended on
   what is impossible, would also vanish away without producing any fruit.
   Away then with those who teach the common people to seek salvation for
   themselves by works, seeing that Paul declares expressly, that the
   promise is abolished if we depend on works. But it is especially
   necessary that this should be known, -- that when there is a reliance
   on works, faith is reduced to nothing. And hence we also learn what
   faith is, and what sort of righteousness ought that of works to be, in
   which men may safely trust.

   The Apostle teaches us, that faith perishes, except the soul rests on
   the goodness of God. Faith then is not a naked knowledge either of God
   or of his truth; nor is it a simple persuasion that God is, that his
   word is the truth; but a sure knowledge of God's mercy, which is
   received from the gospel, and brings peace of conscience with regard to
   God, and rest to the mind. The sum of the matter then is this, -- that
   if salvation depends on the keeping of the law, the soul can entertain
   no confidence respecting it, yea, that all the promises offered to us
   by God will become void: we must thus become wretched and lost, if we
   are sent back to works to find out the cause or the certainty of
   salvation.

   15. For the law causeth wrath, etc. This is a confirmation of the last
   verse, derived from the contrary effect of the law; for as the law
   generates nothing but vengeance, it cannot bring grace. It can indeed
   show to the good and the perfect the way of life: but as it prescribes
   to the sinful and corrupt what they ought to do, and supplies them with
   no power for doing, it exhibits them as guilty before the tribunal of
   God. For such is the viciousness of our nature, that the more we are
   taught what is right and just, the more openly is our iniquity
   discovered, and especially our contumacy, and thus a heavier judgment
   is incurred.

   By wrath, understand God's judgment, which meaning it has everywhere.
   They who explain it of the wrath of the sinner, excited by the law,
   inasmuch as he hates and execrates the Lawgiver, whom he finds to be
   opposed to his lusts, say what is ingenious, but not suitable to this
   passage; for Paul meant no other thing, than that condemnation only is
   what is brought on us all by the law, as it is evident from the common
   use of the expression, and also from the reason which he immediately
   adds.

   Where there is no law, etc. This is the proof, by which he confirms
   what he had said; for it would have been difficult to see how God's
   wrath is kindled against us through the law, unless it had been made
   more apparent. And the reason is, that as the knowledge of God's
   justice is discovered by the law, the less excuse we have, and hence
   the more grievously we offend against God; for they who despise the
   known will of God, justly deserve to sustain a heavier punishment, than
   those who offend through ignorance.

   But the Apostle speaks not of the mere transgression of what is right,
   from which no man is exempt; but he calls that a transgression, when
   man, having been taught what pleases and displeases God, knowingly and
   willfully passes over the boundaries fixed by God's word; or, in other
   words, transgression here is not a mere act of sin, but a willful
   determination to violate what is right. [141] The particle, ou, where,
   which I take as an adverb, some consider to be a relative, of which;
   but the former reading is the most suitable, and the most commonly
   received. Whichever reading you may follow, the meaning will be the
   same, -- that he who is not instructed by the written law, when he
   sins, is not guilty of so great a transgression, as he is who knowingly
   breaks and transgresses the law of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [141] It is better to take this sentence, "Where there is no law, there
   is no transgression," according to its obvious meaning; as it comports
   better with the former clause. The reasoning seems to be this, -- "The
   promise is by faith, and not by the law; for the law brings wrath or
   condemnation: but where there is no law, there is no transgression to
   occasion wrath." The same idea is essentially conveyed in verse Romans
   4:16, where it is said, that the promise is sure, because it is through
   faith and by grace. Had it been by the law, there would have been
   transgression and wrath, and hence the loss of the promise. This verse
   is connected with the Romans 4:13 rather than with the 14th. It
   contains another reason, besides what Romans 4:14 gives, in
   confirmation of what is said in Romans 4:13. Hence Macknight renders
   gar, in this verse, "farther," which renders the connection more
   evident. "Where no law is, there is no transgression, and therefore no
   wrath or punishment; but where law is, there is transgression, wrath,
   and punishment." -- Pareus

   Romans 4:16-17

   16. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the
   promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the
   law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the
   father of us all,

   16. Propterea ex fide, ut secundum gratiam, quo firma sit promissio
   universo semini non ei quod est ex Lege solum, sed quod est ex fide
   Abrah����, qui est pater omnium nostrum,

   17. (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)
   before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and
   calleth those things which be not as though they were.

   17. (sicut scriptum est. Quod patrem multarum gentium posui te,) coram
   Deo, cui credidit, qua vivificat mortuos et vocat ea qu���� non sunt
   tanquam sint.

   16. It is therefore of faith, etc. This is the winding up of the
   argument; and you may summarily include the whole of it in this
   statement, -- "If the heirship of salvation comes to us by works, then
   faith in it vanishes, the promise of it is abolished; but it is
   necessary that both these should be sure and certain; hence it comes to
   us by faith, so that its stability being based on the goodness of God
   alone, may be secured." See how the Apostle, regarding faith as a thing
   firm and certain, considers hesitancy and doubt as unbelief, by which
   faith is abolished, and the promise abrogated. And yet this doubting is
   what the schoolmen call a moral conjecture, and which, alas! they
   substitute for faith.

   That it might be by grace, etc. Here, in the first place, the Apostle
   shows, that nothing is set before faith but mere grace; and this, as
   they commonly say, is its object: for were it to look on merits,
   absurdly would Paul infer, that whatever it obtains for us is
   gratuitous. I will repeat this again in other words, -- "If grace be
   everything that we obtain by faith, then every regard for works is laid
   in the dust." But what next follows more fully removes all ambiguity,
   -- that the promise then only stands firm, when it recumbs on grace:
   for by this expression Paul confirms this truth, that as long as men
   depend on works, they are harassed with doubts; for they deprive
   themselves of what the promises contain. Hence, also, we may easily
   learn, that grace is not to be taken, as some imagine, for the gift of
   regeneration, but for a gratuitous favor: for as regeneration is never
   perfect, it can never suffice to pacify souls, nor of itself can it
   make the promise certain.

   Not to that only which is of the law, etc. Though these words mean in
   another place those who, being absurd zealots of the law, bind
   themselves to its yoke, and boast of their confidence in it, yet here
   they mean simply the Jewish nation, to whom the law of the Lord had
   been delivered. For Paul teaches us in another passage, that all who
   remain bound to the dominion of the law, are subject to a curse; it is
   then certain that they are excluded from the participation of grace. He
   does not then call them the servants of the law, who, adhering to the
   righteousness of works, renounce Christ; but they were those Jews who
   had been brought up in the law, and yet professed the name of Christ.
   But that the sentence may be made clearer, let it be worded thus, --
   "Not to those only who are of the law, but to all who imitate the faith
   of Abraham, though they had not the law before."

   Who is the father of us all, etc. The relative has the meaning of a
   causative particle; for he meant to prove, that the Gentiles were
   become partakers of this grace, inasmuch as by the same oracle, by
   which the heirship was conferred on Abraham and his seed, were the
   Gentiles also constituted his seed: for he is said to have been made
   the father, not of one nation, but of many nations; by which was
   presignified the future extension of grace, then confined to Israel
   alone. For except the promised blessing had been extended to them, they
   could not have been counted as the offspring of Abraham. The past tense
   of the verb, according to the common usage of Scripture, denotes the
   certainty of the Divine counsel; for though nothing then was less
   apparent, yet as God had thus decreed, he is rightly said to have been
   made the father of many nations. Let the testimony of Moses be included
   in a parenthesis, that this clause, "Who is the father of us all," may
   be connected with the other, "before God," etc.: for it was necessary
   to explain also what that relationship was, that the Jews might not
   glory too much in their carnal descent. Hence he says, "He is our
   father before God;" which means the same as though he had said, "He is
   our spiritual father;" for he had this privilege, not from his own
   flesh, but from the promise of God [142]

   17. Whom he believed, who quickens the dead, etc. In this circuitous
   form is expressed the very substance of Abraham's faith, that by his
   example an opening might be made for the Gentiles. He had indeed to
   attain, in a wonderful way, the promise which he had heard from the
   Lord's mouth, since there was then no token of it. A seed was promised
   to him as though he was in vigor and strength; but he was as it were
   dead. It was hence necessary for him to raise up his thoughts to the
   power of God, by which the dead are quickened. It was therefore not
   strange that the Gentiles, who were barren and dead, should be
   introduced into the same society. He then who denies them to be capable
   of grace, does wrong to Abraham, whose faith was sustained by this
   thought, -- that it matters not whether he was dead or not who is
   called by the Lord; to whom it is an easy thing, even by a word, to
   raise the dead through his own power.

   We have here also a type and a pattern of the call of us all, by which
   our beginning is set before our eyes, not as to our first birth, but as
   to the hope of future life, -- that when we are called by the Lord we
   emerge from nothing; for whatever we may seem to be we have not, no,
   not a spark of anything good, which can render us fit for the kingdom
   of God. That we may indeed on the other hand be in a suitable state to
   hear the call of God, we must be altogether dead in ourselves. The
   character of the divine calling is, that they who are dead are raised
   by the Lord, that they who are nothing begin to be something through
   his power. The word call ought not to be confined to preaching, but it
   is to be taken, according to the usage of Scripture, for raising up;
   and it is intended to set forth more fully the power of God, who raises
   up, as it were by a nod only, whom he wills. [143]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] It appears from Pareus and Hammond, that some of the Fathers such
   as Chrysostom, and Theophylact, regarded katenanti in the sense of
   homoios, like, and have rendered the passage, "like God, in whom he
   believed;" that is, that as God is not partial, but the Father of all,
   so Abraham was. But this meaning is not consistent with the import of
   katenanti, nor with the context. The preposition is found in four other
   places, Mark 11:2; Mark 12:41; Mark 13:3; Luke 19:30, and invariably
   means before, or, over against. The Septuagint use it in Numbers 25:4,
   in the sense of before, katenanti tou heliou -- "before the sun," not
   "against the sun" as in our version; for the word in Hebrew is ngd,
   Coram, in conspectu. The context also requires this meaning: Abraham
   was a father of many nations before God, or, in the view or estimation
   of God, and not in the view or estimation of men, because God, as it is
   said at the end of the verse, regards things which are not, as though
   they were. Hence Abraham was already in God's view, according to his
   purpose, the father of many nations. The collocation of the words is
   said by Wolfius to be an instance of Atticism, the word theou, being
   separated from its preposition: and hou is put for ho by the
   grammatical law of attraction; and Stuart brings three similar
   instances of the relative being regulated by the case of its noun,
   though preceding it in the sentence, Mark 6:16, Acts 21:16; and Romans
   6:17

   [143] The idea of commanding to existence, or of effecting, is given by
   many Commentators to the word kalountos; but this seems not necessary.
   The simple notion of calling, naming, regarding, or representing, is
   more consistent with the passage, and with the construction of the
   sentence: and the various modes of rendering it, which critics have
   proposed, have arisen from not taking the word in its most obvious
   meaning. "The literal version is, and who calls things not existing as
   existing," -- kai kalountos ta me onta hos onta. The reference is
   evidently to the declaration, "I have made thee the father of many
   nations." This had then no real existence; but God represents it as
   having an existence already. Far-fetched meanings are sometimes
   adopted, when the plainest and the most obvious is passed by. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:18

   18. Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father
   of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed
   be.

   18. Qui pr����ter (vel supra) spem super spe credidit, ut esset [144]
   pater multarum gentium, secundum quod dictum erat, Sic erit semen tuum.

   18. Who against hope, etc. If we thus read, the sense is, that when
   there was no probable reason, yea, when all things were against him, he
   yet continued to believe. And, doubtless, there is nothing more
   injurious to faith than to fasten our minds to our eyes, that we may
   from what we see, seek a reason for our hope. We may also read, "above
   hope," and perhaps more suitably; as though he had said that by his
   faith he far surpassed all that he could conceive; for except faith
   flies upward on celestial wings so as to look down on all the
   perceptions of the flesh as on things far below, it will stick fast in
   the mud of the world. But Paul uses the word hope twice in this verse:
   in the first instance, he means a probable evidence for hoping, such as
   can be derived from nature and carnal reason; in the second he refers
   to faith given by God; [145] for when he had no ground for hoping he
   yet in hope relied on the promise of God; and he thought it a
   sufficient reason for hoping, that the Lord had promised, however
   incredible the thing was in itself.

   According to what had been said, etc. So have I preferred to render it,
   that it may be applied to the time of Abraham; for Paul meant to say,
   that Abraham, when many temptations were drawing him to despair, that
   he might not fail, turned his thoughts to what had been promised to
   him, "Thy seed shall equal the stars of heaven and the sands of the
   sea;" but he resignedly adduced this quotation incomplete, in order to
   stimulate us to read the Scriptures. The Apostles, indeed, at all
   times, in quoting the Scriptures, took a scrupulous care to rouse us to
   a more diligent reading of them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [144] "Ut esset:" this may indeed be rendered according to our version,
   "that he might become;" but the drift of the comment seems to favor the
   other view, that he believed that he should be, and not that he
   believed in order to be, or that he might be, the father of many
   nations eis to genesthai auton, "that he should be," is the rendering
   of Hammond, Doddridge, and Stuart; and it is indeed what is consistent
   with the drift of the passage, and with what is recorded in Genesis.
   Wolfius says, that eis here does not signify the final cause, but the
   subject or the object of faith and hope; Abraham believed the promise,
   that he should be the father of many nations. -- Ed.

   [145] This is a striking instance of the latitude of meaning which some
   words have in Scripture. Here hope, in the first instance, means the
   ground of hope; and in the second, the object of hope. So faith, in
   Romans 4:5, and in other places, must be considered as including its
   object, the gracious promise of God; for otherwise it will be a
   meritorious act, the very thing which the Apostle throughout repudiates
   with regard to man's justification. Faith, as it lays hold on God's
   promise of free acceptance and forgiveness, can alone, in the very
   nature of things, be imputed for righteousness: it is not indispensably
   necessary that the way, or medium, or the meritorious cause of
   acceptance and forgiveness, should be clearly known and distinctly
   seen; the gracious promise of God is enough, so that faith may become a
   justifying faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 4:19-22

   19. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
   dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness
   of Sarah's womb:

   19. Ac fide minime debilitatus, non consideravit suum ipsius corpus jam
   emortuum, centenaries quum fere esset, nec emortuam vulvam Sar����:

   20. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
   strong in faith, giving glory to God;

   20. Nec vero in Dei promissionem nec emortuam vulvam Sarre: per
   incredulitatem disquisivit; sed roboratus est fide, tribuens gloriam
   Deo;

   21. And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able
   also to perform.

   21. Ac certe persuasus, quod ubi quid promisit, possit etiam pr����stare.

   22. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

   22. Ideo et imputatum illi est in justitiam.

   19. In faith, etc. If you prefer to omit one of the negatives you may
   render it thus, "Being weak in faith, he considered not his own body,"
   etc.; but this makes no sense. He indeed shows now more fully what
   might have hindered, yea, and wholly turned Abraham aside from
   receiving the promise. A seed from Sarah was promised to him at a time
   when he was not by nature fit for generating, nor Sarah for conceiving.
   Whatever he could see as to himself was opposed to the accomplishment
   of the promise. Hence, that he might yield to the truth of God, he
   withdrew his mind from those things which presented themselves to his
   own view, and as it were forgot himself.

   You are not however to think, that he had no regard whatever to his own
   body, now dead, since Scripture testifies to the contrary; for he
   reasoned thus with himself, "Shall a child be born to a man an hundred
   years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety, bear a son?" But as he laid
   aside the consideration of all this, and resigned his own judgment to
   the Lord, the Apostle says, that he considered not, etc.; and truly it
   was a greater effort to withdraw his thoughts from what of itself met
   his eyes, than if such a thing came into his mind.

   And that the body of Abraham was become through age incapable of
   generating, at the time he received the Lord's blessing, is quite
   evident from this passage, and also from Genesis 17 and 18, so that the
   opinion of Augustine is by no means to be admitted, who says somewhere,
   that the impediment was in Sarah alone. Nor ought the absurdity of the
   objection to influence us, by which he was induced to have recourse to
   this solution; for he thought it inconsistent to suppose that Abraham
   in his hundredth year was incapable of generating, as he had afterwards
   many children. But by this very thing God rendered his power more
   visible, inasmuch as he, who was before like a dry and barren tree, was
   so invigorated by the celestial blessing, that he not only begot Isaac,
   but, as though he was restored to the vigor of age, he had afterwards
   strength to beget others. But some one may object and say, that it is
   not beyond the course of nature that a man should beget children at
   that age. Though I allow that such a thing is not a prodigy, it is yet
   very little short of a miracle. And then, think with how many toils,
   sorrows, wanderings, distresses, had that holy man been exercised all
   his life; and it must be confessed, that he was no more debilitated by
   age, than worn out and exhausted by toils. And lastly, his body is not
   called barren simply but comparatively; for it was not probable that
   he, who was unfit for begetting in the flower and vigor of age, should
   begin only now when nature had decayed.

   The expression, being not weak in faith, take in this sense -- that he
   vacillated not, nor fluctuated, as we usually do under difficult
   circumstances. There is indeed a twofold weakness of faith -- one is
   that which, by succumbing to trying adversities, occasions a falling
   away from the supporting power of God -- the other arises from
   imperfection, but does not extinguish faith itself: for the mind is
   never so illuminated, but that many relics of ignorance remain; the
   heart is never so strengthened, but that much doubting cleaves to it.
   Hence with these vices of the flesh, ignorance and doubt, the faithful
   have a continual conflict, and in this conflict their faith is often
   dreadfully shaken and distressed, but at length it comes forth
   victorious; so that they may be said to be strong even in weakness.

   20. Nor did he through unbelief make an inquiry, etc. Though I do not
   follow the old version, nor Erasmus, yet my rendering is not given
   without reason. The Apostle seems to have had this in view, -- That
   Abraham did not try to find out, by weighing the matter in the balance
   of unbelief, whether the Lord was able to perform what he had promised.
   What is properly to inquire or to search into anything, is to examine
   it through diffidence or mistrust, and to be unwilling to admit what
   appears not credible, without thoroughly sifting it. [146] He indeed
   asked, how it could come to pass, but that was the asking of one
   astonished; as the case was with the virgin Mary, when she inquired of
   the angel how could that be which he had announced; and there are other
   similar instances. The saints then, when a message is brought them
   respecting the works of God, the greatness of which exceeds their
   comprehension, do indeed burst forth into expressions of wonder; but
   from this wonder they soon pass on to lay hold on the power of God: on
   the contrary, the wicked, when they examine a message, scoff at and
   reject it as a fable. Such, as you will find, was the case with the
   Jews, when they asked Christ how he could give his flesh to be eaten.
   For this reason it was, that Abraham was not reproved when he laughed
   and asked, how could a child be born to a man an hundred years old, and
   to a woman of ninety; for in his astonishment he fully admitted the
   power of God's word. On the other hand, a similar laughter and inquiry
   on the part of Sarah were not without reproof, because she regarded not
   the promise as valid.

   If these things be applied to our present subject, it will be evident,
   that the justification of Abraham had no other beginning than that of
   the Gentiles. Hence the Jews reproach their own father, if they exclaim
   against the call of the Gentiles as a thing unreasonable. Let us also
   remember, that the condition of us all is the same with that of
   Abraham. All things around us are in opposition to the promises of God:
   He promises immortality; we are surrounded with mortality and
   corruption: He declares that he counts us just; we are covered with
   sins: He testifies that he is propitious and kind to us; outward
   judgments threaten his wrath. What then is to be done? We must with
   closed eyes pass by ourselves and all things connected with us, that
   nothing may hinder or prevent us from believing that God is true.

   But he was strengthened, etc. This is of the same import with a former
   clause, when it is said, that he was not weak in faith. It is the same
   as though he had said, that he overcame unbelief by the constancy and
   firmness of faith. [147] No one indeed comes forth a conqueror from
   this contest, but he who borrows weapons and strength from the word of
   God. From what he adds, giving glory to God, it must be observed, that
   no greater honor can be given to God, than by faith to seal his truth;
   as, on the other hand, no greater dishonor can be done to him, than to
   refuse his offered favor, or to discredit his word. It is hence the
   chief thing in honoring God, obediently to embrace his promises: and
   true religion begins with faith.

   21. That what he had promised, etc. As all men acknowledge God's power,
   Paul seems to say nothing very extraordinary of the faith of Abraham;
   but experience proves, that nothing is more uncommon, or more
   difficult, than to ascribe to God's power the honor which it deserves.
   There is in deed no obstacle, however small and insignificant, by which
   the flesh imagines the hand of God is restrained from working. Hence it
   is, that in the slightest trials, the promises of God slide away from
   us. When there is no contest, it is true, no one, as I have said,
   denies that God can do all things; but as soon as anything comes in the
   way to impede the course of God's promise, we cast down God's power
   from its eminence. Hence, that it may obtain from us its right and its
   honor, when a contest comes, we ought to determine thus, -- That it is
   no less sufficient to overcome the obstacles of the world, than the
   strong rays of the sun are to dissipate the mists. We are indeed wont
   ever to excuse ourselves, that we derogate nothing from God's power,
   whenever we hesitate respecting his promises, and we commonly say, "The
   thought, that God promises more in his word than he can perform, (which
   would be a falsehood and blasphemy against him,) is by no means the
   cause of our hesitation; but that it is the defect which we feel in
   ourselves." But we do not sufficiently exalt the power of God, unless
   we think it to be greater than our weakness. Faith then ought not to
   regard our weakness, misery, and defects, but to fix wholly its
   attention on the power of God alone; for if it depends on our
   righteousness or worthiness, it can never ascend to the consideration
   of God's power. And it is a proof of the unbelief, of which he had
   before spoken, when we mete the Lord's power with our own measure. For
   faith does not think that God can do all things, while it leaves him
   sitting still, but when, on the contrary, it regards his power in
   continual exercise, and applies it, especially, to the accomplishment
   of his word: for the hand of God is ever ready to execute whatever he
   has declared by his mouth.

   It seems strange to me, that Erasmus approved of the relative in the
   masculine gender; for though the sense is not changed, we may yet come
   nearer to the Greek words of Paul. The verb, I know, is passive; [148]
   but the abruptness may be lessened by a little change.

   22. And it was therefore imputed, [149] etc. It becomes now more clear,
   how and in what manner faith brought righteousness to Abraham; and that
   was, because he, leaning on God's word, rejected not the promised
   favor. And this connection of faith with the word ought to be well
   understood and carefully remembered; for faith can bring us nothing
   more than what it receives from the word. Hence he does not become
   immediately just, who is imbued only with a general and confused idea
   that God is true, except he reposes on the promise of his favor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [146] The verb is diekrithe, which Calvin renders "disquisivit." The
   most common meaning of the verb is to hesitate, to doubt: it has the
   sense of exploring and examining, in the active voice, as in 1
   Corinthians 11:31, but not in the passive -- See Matthew 21:21, Mark
   11:23, Acts 10:20. The version of Pareus is, "non disceptavit -- he
   disputed not," and also of Macknight But the fathers, and many moderns,
   such as Beza, Hammond, Stuart, and others, have rendered the sentence,
   "He doubted not:" Phavorinus says, as quoted by Poole, that
   diakrinesthai, is to doubt, to hesitate, to dispute, to distrust,
   (diffidere.) -- Ed.

   [147] "Doubt," says Pareus, has two arguments -- will God do this? and
   can God do this? Faith has also two arguments -- God will do it,
   because He has promised; and he can do it, because He is omnipotent."

   [148] The verb is, epengeltai, used here, and perhaps in one other
   place, Hebrews 12:26, in an active sense. It is usually found, in the
   sense of promising, in the middle voice, as in Mark 14:11; Acts 7:5;
   Hebrews 6:13, etc. It is an anomaly that is to be met with sometimes in
   Greek authors. -- Ed.

   [149] As in a former instance in Romans 4:3, there is no nominative
   case to this verb: it is supplied by the sentence. This is the case not
   unfrequently in languages, such as Greek and Hebrew, in which the
   person is included in the verb itself. There is no nominative in the
   Welsh version, and there seems to be no need of it, Amhyny y cyvrivwyd
   iddo yn gyviawnder "It is most true, as Paul says to the Romans, that
   by faith Abraham was justified, and not by obedience: but it is just as
   true what he says to the Hebrews, that it was by faith that Abraham
   obeyed." -- Chalmers.

   Romans 4:23-25

   23. Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
   him;

   23. Non est autem scriptum propter ipsum tantum, imputatum fuisse illi;

   24. But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him
   that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

   24. Sed etiam propter nos, quibus imputabitur credentibus in eum, qui
   excitavit lesum Dominum nostrum ex mortuis:

   25. Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our
   justification.

   25. Qui traditus fuit propter delicta nostra, et excitatus propter
   nostram justificationem.

   23. Now it was not written, etc. A proof from example is not always
   valid, of which I have before reminded you; lest this should be
   questioned, Paul expressly affirms, that in the person of Abraham was
   exhibited an example of a common righteousness, which belongs equally
   to all.

   We are, by this passage, reminded of the duty of seeking profit from
   the examples recorded in Scripture. That history is the teacher of what
   life ought to be, is what heathens have with truth said; but as it is
   handed down by them, no one can derive from it sound instruction.
   Scripture alone justly claims to itself an office of this kind. For in
   the first place it prescribes general rules, by which we may test every
   other history, so as to render it serviceable to us: and in the second
   place, it clearly points out what things are to be followed, and what
   things are to be avoided. But as to doctrine, which it especially
   teaches, it possesses this peculiarity, -- that it clearly reveals the
   providence of God, his justice and goodness towards his own people, and
   his judgments on the wicked.

   What then is recorded of Abraham is by Paul denied to have been written
   only for his sake; for the subject is not what belongs to the special
   call of one or of any particular person; but that way of obtaining
   righteousness is described, which is ever the same with regard to all;
   and it is what belonged to the common father of the faithful, on whom
   the eyes of all ought to be fixed.

   If then we would make a right and proper use of sacred histories, we
   must remember so to use them as to draw from them sound doctrine. They
   instruct us, in some parts, how to frame our life; in others, how to
   strengthen faith; and then, how we are to be stirred up to serve the
   Lord. In forming our life, the example of the saints may be useful; and
   we may learn from them sobriety, chastity, love, patience, moderation,
   contempt of the world, and other virtues. What will serve to confirm
   faith is the help which God ever gave them, the protection which
   brought comfort in adversities, and the paternal care which he ever
   exercised over them. The judgments of God, and the punishments
   inflicted on the wicked, will also aid us, provided they fill us with
   that fear which imbues the heart with reverence and devotion.

   But by saying, not on his account only, he seems to intimate, that it
   was written partly for his sake. Hence some think, that what Abraham
   obtained by faith was commemorated to his praise, because the Lord will
   have his servants to be forever remembered, according to what Solomon
   says, that their name will be blessed. (Proverbs 10:7.) But what if you
   take the words, not on his account only, in a simpler form, as though
   it were some singular privilege, not fit to be made an example of, but
   yet suitable to teach us, who must be justified in the same manner?
   This certainly would be a more appropriate sense.

   24. Who believe on him, etc. I have already reminded you of the design
   of those periphrastic expressions: Paul introduced them, that he might,
   according to what the passages may require, describe in various ways
   the real character of faith -- of which the resurrection of Christ is
   not the smallest part; for it is the ground of our hope as to eternal
   life. Had he said only, that we believe in God, it could not have been
   so readily learnt how this could serve to obtain righteousness; but
   when Christ comes forth and presents to us in his own resurrection a
   sure pledge of life, it then appears evident from what fountain the
   imputation of righteousness flows.

   25. Who was delivered for our offences, [150] etc. He expands and
   illustrates more at large the doctrine to which I have just referred.
   It indeed greatly concerns us, not only to have our minds directed to
   Christ, but also to have it distinctly made known how he attained
   salvation for us. And though Scripture, when it treats of our
   salvation, dwells especially on the death of Christ, yet the Apostle
   now proceeds farther: for as his purpose was more explicitly to set
   forth the cause of our salvation, he mentions its two parts; and says,
   first, that our sins were expiated by the death of Christ, -- and
   secondly, that by his resurrection was obtained our righteousness. But
   the meaning is, that when we possess the benefit of Christ's death and
   resurrection, there is nothing wanting to the completion of perfect
   righteousness. By separating his death from his resurrection, he no
   doubt accommodates what he says to our ignorance; for it is also true
   that righteousness has been obtained for us by that obedience of
   Christ, which he exhibited in his death, as the Apostle himself teaches
   us in the following chapter. But as Christ, by rising from the dead,
   made known how much he had effected by his death, this distinction is
   calculated to teach us that our salvation was begun by the sacrifice,
   by which our sins were expiated, and was at length completed by his
   resurrection: for the beginning of righteousness is to be reconciled to
   God, and its completion is to attain life by having death abolished.
   Paul then means, that satisfaction for our sins was given on the cross:
   for it was necessary, in order that Christ might restore us to the
   Father's favor, that our sins should be abolished by him; which could
   not have been done had he not on their account suffered the punishment,
   which we were not equal to endure. Hence Isaiah says, that the
   chastisement of our peace was upon him. (Isaiah 53:5.) But he says that
   he was delivered, and not, that he died; for expiation depended on the
   eternal goodwill of God, who purposed to be in this way pacified.

   And was raised again for our justification. As it would not have been
   enough for Christ to undergo the wrath and judgment of God, and to
   endure the curse due to our sins, without his coming forth a conqueror,
   and without being received into celestial glory, that by his
   intercession he might reconcile God to us, the efficacy of
   justification is ascribed to his resurrection, by which death was
   overcome; not that the sacrifice of the cross, by which we are
   reconciled to God, contributes nothing towards our justification, but
   that the completeness of his favor appears more clear by his coming to
   life again. [151]

   But I cannot assent to those who refer this second clause to newness of
   life; for of that the Apostle has not begun to speak; and further, it
   is certain that both clauses refer to the same thing. For if
   justification means renovation, then that he died for our sins must be
   taken in the same sense, as signifying that he acquired for us grace to
   mortify the flesh; which no one admits. Then, as he is said to have
   died for our sins, because he delivered us from the evil of death by
   suffering death as a punishment for our sins; so he is now said to have
   been raised for our justification, because he fully restored life to us
   by his resurrection: for he was first smitten by the hand of God, that
   in the person of the sinner he might sustain the misery of sin; and
   then he was raised to life, that he might freely grant to his people
   righteousness and life. [152] He therefore still speaks of imputative
   justification; and this will be confirmed by what immediately follows
   in the next chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [150] It is dia ta paraptomata hemon, "for our offenses," and dia ten
   dikaiosin hemon, "for our justification." The preposition dia, has here
   clearly two meanings: the first signifies the reason why, and the
   second, the end for which. How is this to be known? By the character of
   the sentence, and by what is taught elsewhere. For, to which Johnson
   attaches forty meanings, is commonly understood here as having a
   different sense, and this is sufficiently indicated by what is
   connected with it. But in case a doubt arises, we have only to consult
   other passages in which the subject is handled. Take the first instance
   -- "for our offenses." There are those who say that dia here means
   because of, or, on account of; and this, in order to evade the idea of
   a propitiation. The preposition, no doubt, has this sense; but is this
   its sense here? If the sentence itself be deemed insufficient to
   determine the question, (though to a plain reader it is,) let us see
   what is said elsewhere of Christ's death in connection with our sins or
   offenses. He himself said, that he came "to give his life a ransom
   (lutron -- a redeeming price) for many," Matthew 20:28. It is said,
   that he "gave himself a ransom (antilutron -- a redeeming price for
   another) for all," 1 Timothy 2:6. It is expressly declared, that
   "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many," Hebrews 9:28. And
   more to the purpose still, if possible, is the testimony of John, when
   he says that Christ "is the propitiation (hilasmos -- expiation) for
   our sins," 1 John 2:2. Now, can it be that we can give any other
   meaning to the text, than that God delivered his Son as a sacrifice for
   our offenses? This is the doctrine of Scripture throughout. -- Ed.

   [151] Christ is said here to have been raised from the dead by God, as
   well as delivered into death. "However much of the import of this,"
   says Chalmers, "may have escaped the notice of an ordinary reader, it
   is pregnant with meaning of the weightiest importance. You know that
   when the prison door is opened to a criminal, and that by the very
   authority which lodged him there, it envinces that the debt of his
   transgression has been rendered, and that he stands aquitted of all
   it's penalties. It was not for his own, but for our offenses that Jesus
   was delivered unto the death, and that his body was consigned to the
   imprisonment of the grave. And when an angel descended from heaven, and
   rolled back the great stone from the door of the sepulchre, this speaks
   to us, that the justice of God is satisfied, that the ransom of our
   iniquity has been paid, that Christ has rendered a full discharge of
   all the debt for which he undertook as the great surety between God and
   the sinners who believe in him." -- Ed.

   [152] "Either therefore as the evidence of the acceptance of his
   suffering as our substitute, or as a necessary step toward securing the
   application of their merit to our benefit, the resurrection of Christ
   was essential to our justification." -- Professor Hodge

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 5:1-2

   1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ:

   1. Iustificatus ergo ex fide, pacem habemus apud Deum per Dominum
   nostrum Iesum Christum;

   2. By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we
   stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

   2. Per quem accessum habiumus fide in gratiam istam in qua stetimus, et
   gloriamur super spe glori���� Dei.

   1. Being then justified, etc. The Apostle begins to illustrate by the
   effects, what he has hitherto said of the righteousness of faith: and
   hence the whole of this chapter is taken up with amplifications, which
   are no less calculated to explain than to confirm. He had said before,
   that faith is abolished, if righteousness is sought by works; and in
   this case perpetual inquietude would disturb miserable souls, as they
   can find nothing substantial in themselves: but he teaches us now, that
   they are rendered quiet and tranquil, when we have obtained
   righteousness by faith, we have peace with God; and this is the
   peculiar fruit of the righteousness of faith. When any one strives to
   seek tranquillity of conscience by works, (which is the case with
   profane and ignorant men,) he labors for it in vain; for either his
   heart is asleep through his disregard or forgetfulness of God's
   judgment, or else it is full of trembling and dread, until it reposes
   on Christ, who is alone our peace.

   Then peace means tranquillity of conscience, which arises from this, --
   that it feels itself to be reconciled to God. This the Pharisee has
   not, who swells with false confidence in his own works; nor the stupid
   sinner, who is not disquieted, because he is inebriated with the
   sweetness of vices: for though neither of these seems to have a
   manifest disquietude, as he is who is smitten with a consciousness of
   sin; yet as they do not really approach the tribunal of God, they have
   no reconciliation with him; for insensibility of conscience is, as it
   were, a sort of retreating from God. Peace with God is opposed to the
   dead security of the flesh, and for this reason, -- because the first
   thing is, that every one should become awakened as to the account he
   must render of his life; and no one can stand boldly before God, but he
   who relies on a gratuitous reconciliation; for as long as he is God,
   all must otherwise tremble and be confounded. And this is the strongest
   of proofs, that our opponents do nothing but prate to no purpose, when
   they ascribe righteousness to works; for this conclusion of Paul is
   derived from this fact, -- that miserable souls always tremble, except
   they repose on the grace of Christ.

   2. Through whom we have access, [153] etc. Our reconciliation with God
   depends only on Christ; for he only is the beloved Son, and we are all
   by nature the children of wrath. But this favor is communicated to us
   by the gospel; for the gospel is the ministry of reconciliation, by the
   means of which we are in a manner brought into the kingdom of God.
   Rightly then does Paul set before our eyes in Christ a sure pledge of
   God's favor, that he might more easily draw us away from every
   confidence in works. And as he teaches us by the word access, that
   salvation begins with Christ, he excludes those preparations by which
   foolish men imagine that they can anticipate God's mercy; as though he
   said, "Christ comes not to you, nor helps you, on account of your
   merits." He afterwards immediately subjoins, that it is through the
   continuance of the same favor that our salvation becomes certain and
   sure; by which he intimates, that perseverance is not founded on our
   power and diligence, but on Christ; though at the same time by saying,
   that we stand, he indicates that the gospel ought to strike deep roots
   into the hearts of the godly, so that being strengthened by its truth,
   they may stand firm against all the devices of Satan and of the flesh.
   And by the word stand, he means, that faith is not a changeable
   persuasion, only for one day; but that it is immutable, and that it
   sinks deep into the heart, so that it endures through life. It is then
   not he, who by a sudden impulse is led to believe, that has faith, and
   is to be reckoned among the faithful; but he who constantly, and, so to
   speak, with a firm and fixed foot, abides in that station appointed to
   him by God, so as to cleave always to Christ.

   And glory in the hope, etc. The reason that the hope of a future life
   exists and dares to exult, is this, -- because we rest on God's favor
   as on a sure foundation: for Paul's meaning is, that though the
   faithful are now pilgrims on the earth, they yet by hope scale the
   heavens, so that they quietly enjoy in their own bosoms their future
   inheritance. And hereby are subverted two of the most pestilent dogmas
   of the sophists. What they do in the first place is, they bid
   Christians to be satisfied with moral conjecture as to the perception
   of God's favor towards them; and secondly, they teach that all are
   uncertain as to their final perseverance; but except there be at
   present sure knowledge, and a firm and undoubting persuasion as to the
   future, who would dare to glory? The hope of the glory of God has shone
   upon us through the gospel, which testifies that we shall be
   participators of the Divine nature; for when we shall see God face to
   face, we shall be like him. (2 Peter 1:4; 1 John 3:2.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [153] Calvin leaves out kai, "also." Griesbach retains it. The omission
   is only in one MS., and in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions: it is
   rendered nun by Theodoret But its meaning here seems not to be "also,"
   but "even" or "yea:" for this verse contains in part the same truth as
   the former. The style of Paul is often very like that of the Prophets,
   that is, the arrangement of his sentences is frequently on their model.
   In the Prophets, and also in the Psalms, we find often two distichs and
   sometimes two verses containing the same sentiment, only the latter
   distich states it differently, and adds something to it. See, for
   example, Psalm 32:1, 2. such is exactly the case here. "Justified by
   faith," and "this grace in which we stand," are the same. "Through our
   Lord Jesus Christ" and "through whom we have access," are identical in
   their import. The additional idea in the second verse is the last
   clause. That we may see how the whole corresponds with the Prophetic
   style, the two verses shall be presented in lines, -- 1. Having then
   been justified by faith,
   We have peace with God,^
   Through our Lord Jesus Christ; 2. Through whom we have had, yea, the
   access by faith
   To this grace, in which we stand,
   And exult in the hope of the glory of God. The illative, then, is to be
   preferred to therefore, as it is an inference, not from a particular
   verse or a clause, but from what the Apostle had been teaching. By the
   phrase, "the glory of God," is meant the glory which God bestows: it
   is, to use the words of Professor Stuart, "genitivus auctoris." The
   word "access," prosagogen has two meanings, -- introduction (adductio)
   -- and access (accessio.) The verb prosagein, is used in 1 Peter 3:18,
   in the sense of introducing, leading or bringing to. So Christ, as
   Wolfius remarks, may be considered to be here represented as the
   introducer and reconciler, through whom believers come to God and hold
   intercourse with him. "Introduction" is the version of Macknight; and
   Doddridge has also adopted this idea. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 5:3-5

   3. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that
   tribulation worketh patience;

   3. Neque id modo, sed gloriamur [154] etiam in afflictionibus; scientes
   quod tribulatio patientiam efficiat;

   4. And patience, experience; and experience, hope:

   4. Patientia vero probationem; probatio autem spem:

   5. And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad
   in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

   5. Porro spes non pudefacit, quoniam dilectio Dei diffusa est in
   cordibus nostris per Spiritum santum, qui datus est nobis.

   3. Not only so, etc. That no one might scoffingly object and say, that
   Christians, with all their glorying, are yet strangely harassed and
   distressed in this life, which condition is far from being a happy one,
   -- he meets this objection, and declares, not only that the godly are
   prevented by these calamities from being blessed, but also that their
   glorying is thereby promoted. To prove this he takes his argument from
   the effects, and adopts a remarkable gradation, and at last concludes,
   that all the sorrows we endure contribute to our salvation and final
   good.

   By saying that the saints glory in tribulations, he is not to be
   understood, as though they dreaded not, nor avoided adversities, or
   were not distressed with their bitterness when they happened, (for
   there is no patience when there is no feeling of bitterness;) but as in
   their grief and sorrow they are not without great consolation, because
   they regard that whatever they bear is dispensed to them for good by
   the hand of a most indulgent Father, they are justly said to glory: for
   whenever salvation is promoted, there is not wanting a reason for
   glorying.

   We are then taught here what is the design of our tribulations, if
   indeed we would prove ourselves to be the children of God. They ought
   to habituate us to patience; and if they do not answer this end, the
   work of the Lord is rendered void and of none effect through our
   corruption: for how does he prove that adversities do not hinder the
   glorying of the faithful, except that by their patience in enduring
   them, they feel the help of God, which nourishes and confirms their
   hope? They then who do not learn patience, do not, it is certain, make
   good progress. Nor is it any objection, that there are recorded in
   Scripture some complaints full of despondency, which the saints had
   made: for the Lord sometimes so depresses and straitens for a time his
   people, that they can hardly breathe, and can hardly remember any
   source of consolation; but in a moment he brings to life those whom he
   had nearly sunk in the darkness of death. So that what Paul says is
   always accomplished in them --

   "We are in every way oppressed, but not made anxious; we are in danger,
   but we are not in despair; we suffer persecution, but we are not
   forsaken; we are cast down but we are not destroyed."
   (2 Corinthians 4:8.)

   Tribulation produces (efficiat) patience, etc. This is not the natural
   effect of tribulation; for we see that a great portion of mankind are
   thereby instigated to murmur against God, and even to curse his name.
   But when that inward meekness, which is infused by the Spirit of God,
   and the consolation, which is conveyed by the same Spirit, succeed in
   the place of our stubbornness, then tribulations become the means of
   generating patience; yea, those tribulations, which in the obstinate
   can produce nothing but indignation and clamorous discontent.

   4. Patience, probation, etc. James, adopting a similar gradation, seems
   to follow a different order; for he says, that patience proceeds from
   probation: but the different meaning of the word is what will reconcile
   both. Paul takes probation for the experience which the faithful have
   of the sure protection of God, when by relying on his aid they overcome
   all difficulties, even when they experience, whilst in patiently
   enduring they stand firm, how much avails the power of the Lord, which
   he has promised to be always present with his people. James takes the
   same word for tribulation itself, according to the common usage of
   Scripture; for by these God proves and tries his servants: and they are
   often called trials. [155]

   According then to the present passage, we then only make advances in
   patience as we ought, when we regard it as having been continued to us
   by God's power, and thus entertain hope as to the future, that God's
   favor, which has ever succored us in our necessities, will never be
   wanting to us. Hence he subjoins, that from probation arises hope; for
   ungrateful we should be for benefits received, except the recollection
   of them confirms our hope as to what is to come.

   5. Hope maketh not ashamed, etc.; [156] that is, it regards salvation
   as most certain. It hence appears, that the Lord tries us by
   adversities for this end, -- that our salvation may thereby be
   gradually advanced. Those evils then cannot render us miserable, which
   do in a manner promote our happiness. And thus is proved what he had
   said, that the godly have reasons for glorying in the midst of their
   afflictions.

   For the love of God, etc. I do not refer this only to the last
   sentence, but to the whole of the preceding passage. I therefore would
   say, -- that by tribulations we are stimulated to patience, and that
   patience finds an experiment of divine help, by which we are more
   encouraged to entertain hope; for however we may be pressed and seem to
   be nearly consumed, we do not yet cease to feel God's favor towards us,
   which affords the richest consolation, and much more abundant than when
   all things happen prosperously. For as that happiness, which is so in
   appearance, is misery itself, when God is adverse to and displeased
   with us; so when he is propitious, even calamities themselves will
   surely be turned to a prosperous and a joyful issue. Seeing all things
   must serve the will of the Creator, who, according to his paternal
   favor towards us, (as Paul declares in the eighth chapter,) overrules
   all the trials of the cross for our salvation, this knowledge of divine
   love towards us is instilled into our hearts to the Spirit of God; for
   the good things which God has prepared for his servants are hid from
   the ears and the eyes and the minds of men, and the Spirit alone is he
   who can reveal them. And the word diffused, is very emphatical; for it
   means that the revelation of divine love towards us is so abounding
   that it fills our hearts; and being thus spread through every part of
   them, it not only mitigates sorrow in adversities, but also, like a
   sweet seasoning, it renders tribulations to be loved by us. [157]

   He says further, that the Spirit is given, that is, bestowed through
   the gratuitous goodness of God, and not conferred for our merits;
   according to what Augustine has well observed, who, though he is
   mistaken in his view of the love of God, gives this explanation, --
   that we courageously bear adversities, and are thus confirmed in our
   hope, because we, having been regenerated by the Spirit, do love God.
   It is indeed a pious sentiment, but not what Paul means: for love is
   not to be taken here in an active but a passive sense. And certain it
   is, that no other thing is taught by Paul than that the true fountain
   of all love is, when the faithful are convinced that they are loved by
   God, and that they are not slightly touched with this conviction, but
   have their souls thoroughly imbued with it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [154] Gloriamur -- kauchometha. The same as in the preceding verse, and
   rendered "boast" by Macknight, and in the former verse by Doddridge and
   here, "glory." "Boast" is certainly not a proper word, for it is
   commonly used in a bad sense. "Rejoice" is too feeble, for it means
   exultation and triumph. -- Ed.

   [155] The word in James is dokimion while here it is dokime. The first
   means a test, or the act of testing -- trial; and the second, the
   result of testing -- experience, and is rendered in our version
   "proof," 2 Corinthians 2:9, -- "experiment," 2 Corinthians 9:13, -- and
   in 2 Corinthians 8:2, "trial," which ought to be experience. Beza says,
   that the first bears to the second a similar relation as cause bears to
   effect: the one thing is testing or probation, and the other is the
   experience that is thereby gained. The word is rendered here, not very
   intelligibly, "approbation," both by Macknight and Stuart; but more
   correctly, "experience," by Beza and Doddridge. -- Ed.

   [156] Chalmers observes, that there are two hopes mentioned in this
   passage, -- the hope of faith in the second verse, and the hope of
   experience in this. "The hope of the fourth verse," he says, "is
   distinct from and posterior to the hope of the second; and it also
   appears to be derived from another source. The first hope is hope in
   believing, a hope which hangs direct on the testimony of God...The
   second hope is grounded on distinct considerations -- not upon what the
   believer sees to be in the testimony of God, but upon what he finds to
   be in himself. -- It is the fruit not of faith, but of experience; and
   is gathered not from the word that is without, but from the feeling of
   what passes within." -- Ed.

   [157] "The love of God" in this passage may mean either the love of
   which God is the object -- love to God, or the love which he possesses
   -- God's love to us: the usus loquendi would admit either of these
   meanings; and hence commentators have differed on the point. The
   expression, ten agapen tou Theou, in Luke 12:42, John 5:42, and in
   other places, means "love to God;" he agape tou Theou, in 1 John 4:9,
   signifies clearly the love of God to us. The meaning then can alone be
   ascertained by the context and by the wording of the sentence. It
   stands connected with Christian graces, patience and hope; and this
   favors the first view, that it is love to God produced within by the
   Spirit. Then the verb, ekkechutai -- is poured out or poured forth,
   seems more suitable to the idea of love being communicated as a gift,
   or as a holy feeling within. It is further what prevents hope from
   being disappointed; it is some good or enjoyment that now strengthens
   and satisfies hope; and to love God who first loved us is to realize in
   a measure what hope expects; and when it is said that it is diffused by
   the Spirit, we are reminded of what Paul says in (Galatians 5:22, that
   "love" is one of the fruits of the Spirit. But it may, on the other
   hand, be alleged, that the verse stands connected with what follows, as
   the next verse begins with "for," and that the subsequent context most
   clearly refers to the love of God to us; and this evidently decides the
   question. The first view, our love to God, has been adopted by
   Augustine, Mede, Doddridge, Scott, and Stuart; and the other, God's
   love to us, by Chrysostom, Beza, Pareus, Grotius, Hodge, and Chalmers,
   and also by Schleusner who gives this paraphrase, "Amor Dei abunde
   nobis declaratus est -- the love of God is abundantly declared to us."
   -- Ed.

   Romans 5:6-9

   6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
   the ungodly.

   6. Christus enim, quum adhuc essemus infirmi secundum rationem
   Temporis, pro impiis mortuus est:

   7. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for
   a good man some would even dare to die.

   7. Vix sane pro justo quis moriatur; nam pro bono forsan aliquis etiam
   mori audeat.

   8. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us.

   8. Confirmat autem erga nos charitatem Deus quod peccatores quum Adhuc
   essemus, Christus pro nobis mortuus est:

   9. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
   from wrath through him.

   9. Multo igitur magis, justificati nunc per sanguinem ejus, servabimur
   per ipsum ab ira.

   6. For Christ, etc. I ventured not in my version to allow myself so
   much liberty as to give this rendering, "In the time in which we were
   weak;" and yet I prefer this sense. An argument begins here, which is
   from the greater to the less, and which he afterwards pursues more at
   large: and though he has not woven the thread of his discourse so very
   distinctly, yet its irregular structure does not disturb the meaning.
   "If Christ," he says, "had mercy on the ungodly, if he reconciled
   enemies to his Father, if he has done this by the virtue of his death,
   much more easily will he save them when justified, and keep those
   restored to favor in the possession of it, especially when the
   influence of his life is added to the virtue of his death." [158] The
   time of weakness some consider to be that, when Christ first began to
   be manifested to the world, and they think that those are called weak,
   who were like children under the tuition of the law. I apply the
   expression to every one of us, and I regard that time to be meant,
   which precedes the reconciliation of each one with God. For as we are
   all born the children of wrath, so we are kept under that curse until
   we become partakers of Christ. And he calls those weak, who have
   nothing in themselves but what is sinful; for he calls the same
   immediately afterwards ungodly. And it is nothing new, that weakness
   should be taken in this sense. He calls, in 1 Corinthians 12:22, the
   covered parts of the body weak; and, in 2 Corinthians 10:10, he
   designates his own bodily presence weak, because it had no dignity. And
   this meaning will soon again occur. When, therefore, we were weak, that
   is, when we were in no way worthy or fit that God should look on us, at
   this very time Christ died for the ungodly: for the beginning of
   religion is faith, from which they were all alienated, for whom Christ
   died. And this also is true as to the ancient fathers, who obtained
   righteousness before he died; for they derived this benefit from his
   future death. [159]

   7. For a just man, etc. The meaning of the passage has constrained me
   to render the particle gar as an affirmative or declarative rather than
   as a causative. The import of the sentence is this, "Most rare, indeed,
   is such an example to be found among men, that one dies for a just man,
   though this may sometimes happen: but let this be granted, yet for an
   ungodly man none will be found willing to die: this is what Christ has
   done." [160] Thus it is an illustration, derived from a comparison; for
   such an example of kindness, as Christ has exhibited towards us, does
   not exist among men.

   8. But God confirms, etc. The verb, sunistesi, has various meanings;
   that which is most suitable to this place is that of confirming; for it
   was not the Apostle's object to excite our gratitude, but to strengthen
   the trust and confidence of our souls. He then confirms, that is,
   exhibits his love to us as most certain and complete, inasmuch as for
   the sake of the ungodly he spared not Christ his own Son. In this,
   indeed, his love appears, that being not moved by love on our part, he
   of his own good will first loved us, as John tells us. (1 John 3:16.)
   -- Those are here called sinners, (as in many other places,) who are
   wholly vicious and given up to sin, according to what is said in John
   9:31, "God hears not sinners," that is, men abandoned and altogether
   wicked. The woman called "a sinner," was one of a shameful character.
   (Luke 7:37.) And this meaning appears more evident from the contrast
   which immediately follows, -- for being now justified through his
   blood: for since he sets the two in opposition, the one to the other,
   and calls those justified who are delivered from the guilt of sin, it
   necessarily follows that those are sinners who, for their evil deeds,
   are condemned. [161] The import of the whole is, -- since Christ has
   attained righteousness for sinners by his death, much more shall he
   protect them, being now justified, from destruction. And in the last
   clause he applies to his own doctrine the comparison between the less
   and the greater: for it would not have been enough for salvation to
   have been once procured for us, were not Christ to render it safe and
   secure to the end. And this is what the Apostle now maintains; so that
   we ought not to fear, that Christ will cut off the current of his favor
   while we are in the middle of our course: for inasmuch as he has
   reconciled us to the Father, our condition is such, that he purposes
   more efficaciously to put forth and daily to increase his favor towards
   us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [158] On the argument of this verse, and on what follows to the tenth
   verse, Professor Stuart makes this remark, -- "The passage before us
   seems to be more direct, in respect to the perseverance of the saints,
   than almost any other passage in the Scriptures which I can find. The
   sentiment here is not dependent on the form of a particular expression,
   (as it appears to be in some other passages); but it is fundamentally
   connected with the very nature of the argument." -- Ed.

   [159] Others, as well as Calvin, such as Chrysostom and Erasmus, have
   connected kata kairon with the preceding, and not with the following
   words. Pareus, who inclined to the same view, gives this explanation,
   -- "He distinguishes the former from the present state, as though he
   said, We who are now justified by faith were formerly ungodly.'"
   Chrysostom refers to the time of the law, and considers the weakness
   here to be that of man under the law. This gives an emphatic meaning to
   "weak," which otherwise it seems not to have, and is countenanced by
   what is said in Romans 8:3, where the law is said to be weak, but weak
   on account of the weakness of the flesh. At the same time it must be
   observed, that most commentators, like Beza, connect these words, kata
   kairon, with the death of Christ, as having taken place "in due time,"
   appointed by God, and pre-signified by the prophets, according to what
   is said in Galatians 4:4. -- Ed.

   [160] Calvin has omitted what is said of the "good" man; for whom, it
   is said, one would perhaps even dare to die. The "just," dikaios, is he
   who acts according to what justice requires, and according to what the
   Rabbins say, "What is mine is mine, and what is thine is thine," sly
   sly vslk slk: but the "good," agathos, is the kind, the benevolent, the
   beneficient, called tvv in Hebrew; who is described by Cicero as one
   who does good to those to whom he can, (vir bonus est is, qui prodest
   quibus potest.) There is here an evident contrast between these words
   and those employed in Romans 5:6 and 8, to designate the character of
   those for whom Christ died. The just, dikaios, is the opposite of the
   "ungodly," asebes; who, by not worshipping and honoring God, is guilty
   of injustice of the highest kind, and in this sense of being unjust it
   is found in Romans 4:5, where God is said to "justify the ungodly,"
   that is, him who is unjust by withholding from God the homage which
   rightly belongs to him. Phavorinus gives athemitos, unlawful, unjust,
   as one of its meanings. -- What forms a contrast with "good" is sinner,
   hamartolos, which often means wicked, mischievous, one given to vice
   and the doing of evil. Suidas describes hamartoloi as those who
   determine to live in transgression, hoi paranomia suzon proairoumenoi;
   and Schleusner gives "scelestus -- wicked," "flagitiosus -- full of
   mischief," as being sometimes its meaning. But the description goes
   farther, for in Romans 5:10 the word "enemies echthroi," is introduced
   in order to complete the character of those for whom Christ died. They
   were not only "ungodly," and therefore unjust towards God, and
   "wicked," given to all evils; but also "enemies," entertaining hatred
   to God, and carrying on war, as it were, against him. -- Ed.

   [161] The meaning given to sunistesi is not peculiar. It is used with
   an accusative in two senses, -- to recommend, to commend, to praise, as
   in Romans 16:1; 2 Corinthians 3:1; 2 Corinthians 5:12; 2 Corinthians
   10:12, 18; and also, to prove, to demonstrate, to shew, to render
   manifest or certain, and thus to confirm, as in Romans 3:5; 2
   Corinthians 6:4; 7:11; Galatians 2:18; Schleusner refers to this
   passage as an instance of the latter meaning. That God proved, or
   rendered manifest, or conspicuously shewed, his love, seems to be the
   most suitable idea, as the proof or the evidence is stated in the words
   which follow. The Syriac version gives the sense of shewing or proving.
   Vatablus has "proves" or verifies; Grotius, "renders conspicuous,"
   Beza, "commends," as our version and Macknight; Doddridge,
   "recommends;" Hodge, "renders conspicuous." -- Ed.

   Romans 5:10

   10. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his
   life.

   10. Si enim quum inimici essemus, reconciliati sumus Deo per mortem
   Filii ejus; multo magis, reconciliati, servabimur per vitam ipsius.

   10. This is an explanation of the former verse, amplified by
   introducing a comparison between life and death. We were enemies, he
   says, when Christ interposed for the purpose of propitiating the
   Father: through this reconciliation we are now friends; since this was
   effected by his death; much more influential and efficacious will be
   his life. [162] We hence have ample proofs to strengthen our hearts
   with confidence respecting our salvation. By saying that we were
   reconciled to God by the death of Christ, he means, that it was the
   sacrifice of expiation, by which God was pacified towards the world, as
   I have showed in the fourth chapter.

   But the Apostle seems here to be inconsistent with himself; for if the
   death of Christ was a pledge of the divine love towards us, it follows
   that we were already acceptable to him; but he says now, that we were
   enemies. To this answer, that as God hates sin, we are also hated by
   him as far as we are sinners; but as in his secret counsel he chooses
   us into the body of Christ, he ceases to hate us: but restoration to
   favor is unknown to us, until we attain it by faith. Hence with regard
   to us, we are always enemies, until the death of Christ interposes in
   order to propitiate God. And this twofold aspect of things ought to be
   noticed; for we do not know the gratuitous mercy of God otherwise than
   as it appears from this -- that he spared not his only-begotten Son;
   for he loved us at a time when there was discord between him and us:
   nor can we sufficiently understand the benefit brought to us by the
   death of Christ, except this be the beginning of our reconciliation
   with God, that we are persuaded that it is by the expiation that has
   been made, that he, who was before justly angry with us, is now
   propitious to us. Since then our reception into favor is ascribed to
   the death of Christ, the meaning is, that guilt is thereby taken away,
   to which we should be otherwise exposed.

   Romans 5:11

   11. And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus

   11. Non solum autem, sed etiam gloriamur in Deo per Dominum Iesum

   11. And not this only, etc. He now ascends into the highest strain of
   glorying; for when we glory that God is ours, whatever blessings can be
   imagined or wished, ensue and flow from this fountain; for God is not
   only the chief of all good things, but also possesses in himself the
   sum and substance of all blessings; and he becomes ours through Christ.
   We then attain this by faith, -- that nothing is wanting to us as to
   happiness. Nor is it in vain that he so often mentions reconciliation:
   it is, first, that we may be taught to fix our eyes on the death of
   Christ, whenever we speak of our salvation; and, secondly, that we may
   know that our trust must be fixed on nothing else, but on the expiation
   made for our sins.

   Romans 5:12-14

   12. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
   sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:

   12. Quamobrem sicut per unum hominem peccatum in mundum introiit, et
   per peccatum mors; atque ita in omnes homines mors pervagata est.
   quandoquidem omnes peccaverunt:

   13. (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed
   when there is no law.

   13. (Nam usque ad legem peccatum erat in mundo; peccatum autem non
   imputatur, quum non est lex:

   14. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that
   had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the
   figure of him that was to come.

   14. Sed regnavit mors ab Adam usque ad Mosen, etiam in eos qui non
   peccaverunt ad similitudinem pr����vericationis Adam, qui est figura
   futuri.

   12 Wherefore as, etc. He now begins to enlarge on the same doctrine, by
   comparing with it what is of an opposite character. For since Christ
   came to redeem us from the calamity into which Adam had fallen, and had
   precipitated all his posterity with him, we cannot see with so much
   clearness what we have in Christ, as by having what we have lost in
   Adam set before us, though all things on both sides are not similar:
   hence Paul subjoins an exception, which we shall notice in its place;
   and we shall also point out any other difference that may occur. The
   incompleteness of the sentence sometimes renders it obscure, as when
   the second clause, which answers to the former, is not expressed. But
   we shall endeavor to make both plain when we come to those parts. [163]

   Sin entered into the world, etc. Observe the order which he keeps here;
   for he says, that sin preceded, and that from sin death followed. There
   are indeed some who contend, that we are so lost through Adam's sin, as
   though we perished through no fault of our own, but only, because he
   had sinned for us. But Paul distinctly affirms, that sin extends to all
   who suffer its punishment: and this he afterwards more fully declares,
   when subsequently he assigns a reason why all the posterity of Adam are
   subject to the dominion of death; and it is even this -- because we
   have all, he says, sinned. But to sin in this case, is to become
   corrupt and vicious; for the natural depravity which we bring, from our
   mother's womb, though it brings not forth immediately its own fruits,
   is yet sin before God, and deserves his vengeance: and this is that sin
   which they call original. For as Adam at his creation had received for
   us as well as for himself the gifts of God's favor, so by falling away
   from the Lord, he in himself corrupted, vitiated, depraved, and ruined
   our nature; for having been divested of God's likeness, he could not
   have generated seed but what was like himself. Hence we have all
   sinned; for we are all imbued with natural corruption, and so are
   become sinful and wicked. Frivolous then was the gloss, by which
   formerly the Pelagians endeavored to elude the words of Paul, and held,
   that sin descended by imitation from Adam to the whole human race; for
   Christ would in this case become only the exemplar and not the cause of
   righteousness. Besides, we may easily conclude, that he speaks not here
   of actual sin; for if everyone for himself contracted guilt, why did
   Paul form a comparison between Adam and Christ? It then follows that
   our innate and hereditary depravity is what is here referred to. [164]

   13. For until the law, etc. This parenthesis anticipates an objection:
   for as there seems to be no transgression without the law, it might
   have been doubted whether there were before the law any sin: that there
   was after the law admitted of no doubt. The question only refers to the
   time preceding the law. To this then he gives this answer, -- that
   though God had not as yet denounced judgment by a written law, yet
   mankind were under a curse, and that from the womb; and hence that they
   who led a wicked and vicious life before the promulgation of the law,
   were by no means exempt from the condemnation of sin; for there had
   always been some notion of a God, to whom honor was due, and there had
   ever been some rule of righteousness. This view is so plain and so
   clear, that of itself it disproves every opposite notion.

   But sin is not imputed, etc. Without the law reproving us, we in a
   manner sleep in our sins; and though we are not ignorant that we do
   evil, we yet suppress as much as we can the knowledge of evil offered
   to us, at least we obliterate it by quickly forgetting it. While the
   law reproves and chides us, it awakens us as it were by its stimulating
   power, that we may return to the consideration of God's judgment. The
   Apostle then intimates that men continue in their perverseness when not
   roused by the law, and that when the difference between good and evil
   is laid aside, they securely and joyfully indulge themselves, as if
   there was no judgment to come. But that before the law iniquities were
   by God imputed to men is evident from the punishment of Cain, from the
   deluge by which the whole world was destroyed, from the fate of Sodom,
   and from the plagues inflicted on Pharaoh and Abimelech on account of
   Abraham, and also from the plagues brought on the Egyptians. That men
   also imputed sin to one another, is clear from the many complaints and
   expostulations by which they charged one another with iniquity, and
   also from the defenses by which they labored to clear themselves from
   accusations of doing wrong. There are indeed many examples which prove
   that every man was of himself conscious of what was evil and of what
   was good: but that for the most part they connived at their own evil
   deeds, so that they imputed nothing as a sin to themselves unless they
   were constrained. When therefore he denies that sin without the law is
   imputed, he speaks comparatively; for when men are not pricked by the
   goads of the law, they become sunk in carelessness. [165]

   But Paul wisely introduced this sentence, in order that the Jews might
   hence more clearly learn how grievously they offended, inasmuch as the
   law openly condemned them; for if they were not exempted from
   punishment whom God had never summoned as guilty before his tribunal,
   what would become of the Jews to whom the law, like a herald, had
   proclaimed their guilt, yea, on whom it denounced judgment? There may
   be also another reason adduced why he expressly says, that sin reigned
   before the law, but was not imputed, and that is, that we may know that
   the cause of death proceeds not from the law, but is only made known by
   it. Hence he declares, that all became miserably lost immediately after
   the fall of Adam, though their destruction was only made manifest by
   the law. If you translate this adversative de, though, the text would
   run better; for the meaning is, that though men may indulge themselves,
   they cannot yet escape God's judgment, even when there is no law to
   reprove them.

   Death reigned from Adam, etc. He explains more clearly that it availed
   men nothing that from Adam to the time when the law was promulgated,
   they led a licentious and careless life, while the difference between
   good and evil was willfully rejected, and thus, without the warning of
   the law, the remembrance of sin was buried; yea, that this availed them
   nothing, because sin did yet issue in their condemnation. It hence
   appears, that death even then reigned; for the blindness and obduracy
   of men could not stifle the judgment of God.

   14. Even over them, etc. Though this passage is commonly understood of
   infants, who being guilty of no actual sin, die through original sin, I
   yet prefer to regard it as referring to all those who sinned without
   the law; for this verse is to be connected with the preceding clause,
   which says, that those who were without the law did not impute sin to
   themselves. Hence they sinned not after the similitude of Adam's
   transgression; for they had not, like him, the will of God made known
   to them by a certain oracle: for the Lord had forbidden Adam to touch
   the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; but to them he
   had given no command besides the testimony of conscience. The Apostle
   then intended to imply, that it did not happen through the difference
   between Adam and his posterity that they were exempt from condemnation.
   Infants are at the same time included in their number.

   Who is a type of him who was to come. This sentence is put instead of a
   second clause; for we see that one part only of the comparison is
   expressed, the other is omitted -- an instance of what is called
   anacoluthon [166] You are then to take the meaning as though it was
   said, "as by one man sin entered into the whole world, and death
   through sin, so by one man righteousness returned, and life through
   righteousness." But in saying that Adam bore a resemblance to Christ,
   there is nothing incongruous; for some likeness often appears in things
   wholly contrary. As then we are all lost through Adam's sin, so we are
   restored through Christ's righteousness: hence he calls Adam not
   inaptly the type of Christ. But observe, that Adam is not, said to be
   the type of sin, nor Christ the type of righteousness, as though they
   led the way only by their example, but that the one is contrasted with
   the other. Observe this, lest you should foolishly go astray with
   Origen, and be involved in a pernicious error; for he reasoned
   philosophically and profanely on the corruption of mankind, and not
   only diminished the grace of Christ, but nearly obliterated it
   altogether. The less excusable is Erasmus, who labors much in
   palliating a notion so grossly delirious.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [163] The beginning of this verse has occasioned a vast number of
   conjectures, both as to the connection and as to the corresponding
   clause to the first sentence. Most agree in the main with Calvin on
   these two points. Hodge announces a similar view as to the connection
   in these words, -- "The idea of men being regarded and treated, not
   according to their own merits, but the merit of another, is contrary to
   the common mode of thinking among men. The Apostle illustrates and
   enforces it by an appeal to the great analogous fact in the history of
   the world." As to the corresponding clause, that it is found in the
   18^th verse, there is a common consent, -- Pareus, Willet, Grotius,
   Doddridge, Scott, Stuart, Chalmers, etc.; the intervening verses are
   viewed as parenthetic. The phrase, dia touto, and also dio and oun, are
   sometimes used anticipatively as well as retrospectively, as their
   corresponding particles are often in Hebrew. See [3]note on Romans 2:1.
   That Paul uses dia touto in this way appears evident from Romans 4:16;
   Romans 13:6; 1 Corinthians 11:10. It anticipates here, as I think, what
   is afterwards expressed by eph ho, as in Romans 4:16, by hina, in
   Romans 13:6, by gar, and in 1 Corinthians 11:10, by dia before angels.
   Then the meaning of the verse would be conveyed by the following
   rendering, -- 12. For this reason -- as through one man sin entered
   into the world, and through sin death, even so death came on all men,
   because all have sinned. According to this view, the corresponding
   clause is in the verse itself. The sentiment of the passage is this, --
   through one man sin entered and death followed; and death followed as
   to all mankind, because all had sinned. Then, according to his usual
   manner, the Apostle takes up the last subject, "sin," issuing in the
   death of all; and at the end of the Romans 5:14 he goes back to "the
   one man," Adam, who he says was a type of another: and this sentence is
   made the text of what follows till the end of the Romans 5:19. Having
   before referred to the state of things before the "law," in the two
   remaining verses he refers to the bearing of the law on his subject,
   and shows that there is in Christ an abundant provision for the
   increase of sin occasioned by the law. So abundant is grace that it is
   fully sufficient to remove original sin, actual sins -- its fruits, and
   the sins discovered by the law, and by its means increased and
   enhanced. Hence superabundance is ascribed to it. -- Ed.

   [164] The particles eph o, at the end of this verse, have been
   variously rendered, without much change in the meaning. "In quo -- in
   which," i.e., sin, Augustine; "in quo -- in whom," i.e., man,
   Chrysostom and Beza; "per quem -- by or through whom," Grotius;
   "propterea quod," vel, "quia," vel, "quoniam -- because," Luther,
   Pareus, and Raphelius; which is the same with that of Calvin See
   Matthew 26:50; 2 Corinthians 5:4; Philippians 3:12 Wolfius quotes a
   singular passage from a Jewish Rabbi, Moses Tranensis, "In the sin
   which the first man sinned, the whole world through him (or in him, vv)
   sinned: for he was every man, or all mankind -- ky zh kl 'dm." The idea
   is exactly the same with that of the Apostle. "There are three things,"
   says Pareus, "which are to be considered in Adam's sin, -- the sinful
   act, the penalty of the law, and the depravity of nature; or in other
   words, the transgression of the command, the punishment of death, and
   natural corruption, which was the loss of God's image, and in its stead
   came deformity and disorder. From none of these his posterity are free,
   but all these have descended to them; there is a participation of the
   transgression, an imputation of guilt, and the propagation of natural
   depravity. There is a participation of the sin; for all his posterity
   were seminally in his loins, so that all sinned in his sin, as Levi
   paid tithes in the loins of Abraham; and as children are a part of
   their parents, so children are in a manner partakers of their parents'
   sin. There is also an imputation of guilt, for the first man so stood
   in favor, that when he sinned, not only he, but also all his posterity
   fell with him, and became with him subject to eternal death. And
   lastly, there is the propagation or the generation of a dreadful
   deformity of nature; for such as Adam became after the fall, such were
   the children he begat, being after his own image, and not after the
   image of God. Genesis 5:1. All these things, as to the first sin, apply
   to the parent and also to the children, with only this difference --
   that Adam sinning first transgressed, first contracted guilt, and first
   depraved his nature, -- and that all these things belong to his
   posterity by participation, imputation, and propagation." Both Stuart
   and Barnes stumble here; and though they denounce theorizing, and
   advocate adherence to the language of Scripture, they do yet theorize
   and attempt to evade the plain and obvious meaning of this passage. But
   in trying to avoid one difficulty, they make for themselves another
   still greater. The penalty, or the imputation of guilt, they admit;
   which is indeed undeniable, as facts, as well as Scripture, most
   clearly prove: but the participation they deny, though words could
   hardly be framed to express it more distinctly than the words of this
   verse; and thus, according to their view, a punishment is inflicted
   without a previous implication in an offense; while the Scriptural
   account of the matter is, according to what Calvin states, that "sin
   extends to all who suffer its punishment," though he afterwards
   explains this in a way that is not altogether consistent. -- Ed.

   [165] This verse, as bearing on the argument, maybe viewed rather
   differently. This and the following verse contain an explanation or an
   illustration of the last, Romans 5:12. He states in this verse two
   things: a fact and a general principle; the fact is, that sin, the
   first sin in its evident effects, (for he speaks throughout of no other
   sin, as to Adam, or as producing death,) was in the world before the
   law of Moses was given; and the general principle he avows this, that
   no sin is imputed where there is no law. Having made this last
   admission, he proceeds in the Romans 5:14 to say, that "nevertheless,"
   or notwithstanding, death, the effect of sin, prevailed in the world,
   and prevailed even as to those who did not actually or personally sin
   as Adam did. He takes no account of personal sins, for his object was
   to show the effects of the first sin. And then he says, that in is
   respect Adam was a kind of type, a figure, a representative of Christ
   who was to come; and in the three verses which follow, Romans 5:15, 16,
   and 17, he traces the similitude between the two, pointing out at the
   same time the difference, which in every instance is in favor of the
   last Adam. That tupos signifies here likeness and not identity, is
   quite certain, whatever may be its common meaning because its import is
   exemplified and illustrated in the verses which follow. -- Ed.

   Romans 5:15

   15. But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through
   the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the
   gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto
   many.

   15. Sed non sicut delictum, ita et donum; nam si unius delicto [167]
   multi mortui sunt, multo magis gratia Dei et donum Dei in gratia, qu����
   fuit unius hominis Christi, in multos abundavit.

   15. But not as the offense, etc. Now follows the rectifying or the
   completion of the comparison already introduced. The Apostle does not,
   however, very minutely state the points of difference between Christ
   and Adam, but he obviates errors into which we might otherwise easily
   fall, and what is needful for an explanation we shall add. Though he
   mentions oftentimes a difference, yet there are none of these
   repetitions in which there is not a want of a corresponding clause, or
   in which there is not at least an ellipsis. Such instances are indeed
   defects in a discourse; but they are not prejudicial to the majesty of
   that celestial wisdom which is taught us by the Apostle; it has, on the
   contrary, so happened through the providence of God, that the highest
   mysteries have been delivered to us in the garb of an humble style,
   [168] in order that our faith may not depend on the potency of human
   eloquence, but on the efficacious working of the Spirit alone.

   He does not indeed even now expressly supply the deficiency of the
   former sentence, but simply teaches us, that there is a greater measure
   of grace procured by Christ, than of condemnation introduced by the
   first man. What some think, that the Apostle carries on here a chain of
   reasoning, I know not whether it will be deemed by all sufficiently
   evident. It may indeed be justly inferred, that since the fall of Adam
   had such an effect as to produce the ruin of many, much more
   efficacious is the grace of God to the benefit of many; inasmuch as it
   is admitted, that Christ is much more powerful to save, than Adam was
   to destroy. But as they cannot be disproved, who wish to take the
   passage without this inference, I am willing that they should choose
   either of these views; though what next follows cannot be deemed an
   inference, yet it is of the same meaning. It is hence probable, that
   Paul rectifies, or by way of exception modifies, what he had said of
   the likeness between Christ and Adam.

   But observe, that a larger number (plures) are not here contrasted with
   many (multis,) for he speaks not of the number of men: but as the sin
   of Adam has destroyed many, he draws this conclusion, -- that the
   righteousness of Christ will be no less efficacious to save many. [169]

   When he says, by the offense of one, etc., understand him as meaning
   this, -- that corruption has from him descended to us: for we perish
   not through his fault, as though we were blameless; but as his sin is
   the cause of our sin, Paul ascribes to him our ruin: our sin I call
   that which is implanted in us, and with which we are born.

   The grace of God and the gift of God through grace, etc. Grace is
   properly set in opposition to offense; the gift which proceeds from
   grace, to death. Hence grace means the free goodness of God or
   gratuitous love, of which he has given us a proof in Christ, that he
   might relieve our misery: and gift is the fruit of this mercy, and hath
   come to us, even the reconciliation by which we have obtained life and
   salvation, righteousness, newness of life, and every other blessing. We
   hence see how absurdly the schoolmen have defined grace, who have
   taught that it is nothing else but a quality infused into the hearts of
   men: for grace, properly speaking, is in God; and what is in us is the
   effect of grace. And he says, that it is by one man; for the Father has
   made him the fountain out of whose fullness all must draw. And thus he
   teaches us, that not even the least drop of life can be found out of
   Christ, -- that there is no other remedy for our poverty and want, than
   what he conveys to us from his own abundance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [167] Delicto -- fault, paraptoma -- stumbling, fall, transgression.
   Perhaps the last would be the best word here. It is rendered sometimes
   in the plural number "trespasses," Matthew 18:35; 2 Corinthians 5:19;
   Ephesians 2:1 Macknight renders it here "fall," but most "offense." The
   comparison here is between the sin of one, which produced death, and
   the grace of God through one, which brings the "gift" of life; and the
   difference, "much more," seems to refer to the exuberance of grace by
   which man is to be raised to a higher state than that from which Adam
   fell. "A little lower than the angels" was man in his first creation;
   he is by exuberance of grace to be raised to a state as high as that of
   angels, if not higher; or we may take "much more" as intimating the
   greater power of grace to recover than sin to destroy. Sin is the act
   of man, and issued in death; but grace is the act of God, and will
   therefore with greater certainty issue in life. "Adam's life after his
   fall was even as a slow dying, that reached its completion in his
   physical death; Christ's zoopoiesis of mankind is also gradual, the
   height of which is in the glorification of the body." -- Olshausen

   [168] "Sub contemptibili verborum humilitate." This sort of derogatory
   language as to the style of Scripture, Calvin had evidently learnt from
   the fathers. Chrysostom and Jerome did sometimes say most unwarrantable
   things in this respect, and that in a great measure because they did
   not understand the style of the New Testament, and in part with the
   view of taking away, by an admission, the force of objections alleged
   by admirers of Grecian and refined diction. The style of the New
   Testament is that of the Old; and hardly any of the fathers, except
   Origen and Jerome knew Hebrew, and the latter learnt it only in his old
   age, so that he could have had no great insight into its peculiarities.
   One like Chrysostom brought up in the refinements of Grecian
   literature, was a very unfit judge of the style of the New Testament,
   and hence it is that the criticisms of the Greek fathers in general are
   comparatively of very little value. The whole of this passage, 12-19,
   is constructed according to the model of the Hebrew style; and when
   rightly understood, it will appear to contain none of those defects
   ascribed to it. -- Ed.

   [169] It is evident that the many hoi polloi, include those connected
   with the two parties -- the many descendants of Adam, and the many
   believers in Christ. And "the many" was adopted to form a contrast with
   the "one." "The many" are termed "all" in verse Romans 5:18, and again,
   "the many," in Romans 5:19. They are called "the many" and "all" alike
   with regard both to Adam and to Christ. Some maintain that the terms
   are coextensive in the two instances. That the whole race of man is
   meant in the one instances cannot be doubted: and is there any reason
   why the whole race of man should not be included in the second? Most
   clearly there is. The Apostle speaks of Adam and his posterity, and
   also of Christ and his people, or those "who receive abundance of
   grace," or, "are made righteous;" and "the many" and the "all" are
   evidently those who belong to each separately. In no other way can the
   words with any consistency be understood. All who fell in Adam do not
   certainly "receive abundance of grace," and are not "made righteous."
   And it is not possible, as Professor Hodge observes, "so to eviscerate
   such declarations as these, as to make them to contain nothing more
   than that the chance of salvation is offered to all men." This is
   indeed contrary to evident facts. Nor can they mean, that a way of
   acceptance has been opened, which is suitable to all; for though this
   is true, it yet cannot be the meaning here. Hence "the many" and the
   "all," as to Adam, are all his descendants; and "the many" and the
   "all," as to Christ, are those who believe. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 5:16

   16. And not as it was by one that sinned, [170] so is the gift: for the
   judgement was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
   offences unto justification.

   16. Et non sicut per unum qui peccaverat, ita donum; judicium enim ex
   uno in condemnationem, donum autem ex multis delictis in
   justificationem.

   16. This is especially an explanation of what he had said before, --
   that by one offense guilt issued in the condemnation of us all, but
   that grace, or rather the gratuitous gift, is efficacious to our
   justification from many offenses. It is indeed an expansion of what the
   last verse contains; for he had not hitherto expressed, how or in what
   respect Christ excelled Adam. This difference being settled, it appears
   evident, that their opinion is impious, who have taught that we recover
   nothing else by Christ but a freedom from original sin, or the
   corruption derived from Adam. Observe also, that these many offenses,
   from which he affirms we are freed through Christ, are not to be
   understood only of those which every one must have committed before
   baptism, but also of those by which the saints contract daily new
   guilt; and on account of which they would be justly exposed to
   condemnation, were they not continually relieved by this grace.

   He sets gift in opposition to judgment: by the latter he means strict
   justice; by the former, gratuitous pardon. From strict justice comes
   condemnation; from pardon, absolution. Or, which is the same thing,
   were God to deal with us according to justice, we should be all undone;
   but he justifies us freely in Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [170] Many copies have hamartematos -- sin; but it is a reading deemed
   by Griesbach of less authority than the received text, hamartesantos --
   sinning: yet there being good MSS. in its favor, and several versions,
   especially the Syriac and the Vulgate, and the passage requiring it,
   this reading is to be preferred. Then the rendering would be the
   following, -- And not as through one sin, is the free gift -- (dorema;)
   for judment was indeed from one sin to condemnation, but the free favor
   (charisma) is from many trespasses to justification. It is the
   character of the Apostle's style to change his words, while the same
   idea is often intended. The comparison here is between the one sin
   which issued in condemnation, and the many trespasses or offenses, from
   which a justification is the favor obtained. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 5:17

   17. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they
   which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall
   reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) [171]

   17. Si enin unius delicto mors regnavit per unum; multo magis qui
   exuberantiam grati���� et doni justiti���� acceperunt, in vita regnabunt per
   unum Iesum Christum.)

   17. For if the offense of one, etc. He again subjoins a general
   explanation, on which he dwells still further; for it was by no means
   his purpose to explain every part of the subject, but to state the main
   points. He had before declared, that the power of grace had surpassed
   that of sin: and by this he consoles and strengthens the faithful, and,
   at the same time, stimulates and encourages them to meditate on the
   benignity of God. Indeed the design of so studious a repetition was, --
   that the grace of God might be worthily set forth, that men might be
   led from self-confidence to trust in Christ, that having obtained his
   grace they might enjoy full assurance; and hence at length arises
   gratitude. The sum of the whole is this -- that Christ surpasses Adam;
   the sin of one is overcome by the righteousness of the other; the curse
   of one is effaced by the grace of the other; from one, death has
   proceeded, which is absorbed by the life which the other bestows.

   But the parts of this comparison do not correspond; instead of adding,
   "the gift of life shall more fully reign and flourish through the
   exuberance of grace," he says, that "the faithful shall reign;" which
   amounts to the same thing; for the reign of the faithful is in life,
   and the reign of life is in the faithful.

   It may further be useful to notice here the difference between Christ
   and Adam, which the Apostle omitted, not because he deemed it of no
   importance, but unconnected with his present subject.

   The first is, that by Adam's sin we are not condemned through
   imputation alone, as though we were punished only for the sin of
   another; but we suffer his punishment, because we also ourselves are
   guilty; for as our nature is vitiated in him, it is regarded by God as
   having committed sin. But through the righteousness of Christ we are
   restored in a different way to salvation; for it is not said to be
   accepted for us, because it is in us, but because we possess Christ
   himself with all his blessings, as given to us through the bountiful
   kindness of the Father. Hence the gift of righteousness is not a
   quality with which God endows us, as some absurdly explain it, but a
   gratuitous imputation of righteousness; for the Apostle plainly
   declares what he understood by the word grace. The other difference is,
   that the benefit of Christ does not come to all men, while Adam has
   involved his whole race in condemnation; and the reason of this is
   indeed evident; for as the curse we derive from Adam is conveyed to us
   by nature, it is no wonder that it includes the whole mass; but that we
   may come to a participation of the grace of Christ, we must be
   ingrafted in him by faith. Hence, in order to partake of the miserable
   inheritance of sin, it is enough for thee to be man, for it dwells in
   flesh and blood; but in order to enjoy the righteousness of Christ it
   is necessary for thee to be a believer; for a participation of him is
   attained only by faith. He is communicated to infants in a peculiar
   way; for they have by covenant the right of adoption, by which they
   pass over unto a participation of Christ. [172] Of the children of the
   godly I speak, to whom the promise of grace is addressed; for others
   are by no means exempted from the common lot.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [171] This verse, according to the usual manner of the Apostle, whose
   style is that of the Prophets, includes the two main ideas of the two
   preceding verses, in another form, and in an inverted order, as it
   refers first to the one offense and then to the one man, in the first
   clause; and the same order is followed in the second; "the exuberance
   of grace" is to cover the many offenses before mentioned, as opposed to
   the one offense, and to one man is opposed one Christ Jesus. The
   reading en to heni, though according to Griesbach, it is not, as to
   MSS., of equal authority with the received text, is yet to be
   preferred; for tou henos makes a tautology, and destroys the order
   which we find preserved in the second clause. -- Ed.

   [172] The original is, "Habent enim in foedere jus adoptionis, quo in
   Christi communionem transeunt." -- Ed.

   Romans 5:18

   18. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to
   condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came
   upon all men unto justification of life.

   18. Itaque quemadmodum, per unius delictum, in omnes homines in
   condemnationem; sic et per unius justificationem, in omnes homines in
   justificationem vit����.

   18. Therefore, etc. This is a defective sentence; it will be complete
   if the words condemnation and justification be read in the nominative
   case; as doubtless you must do in order to complete the sense. We have
   here the general conclusion from the preceding comparison; for,
   omitting the mention of the intervening explanation, he now completes
   the comparison, "As by the offense of one we were made (constitute)
   sinners; so the righteousness of Christ is efficacious to justify us.
   He does not say the righteousness -- dikaiosunen, but the justification
   -- dikaioma, [173] of Christ, in order to remind us that he was not as
   an individual just for himself, but that the righteousness with which
   he was endued reached farther, in order that, by conferring this gift,
   he might enrich the faithful. He makes this favor common to all,
   because it is propounded to all, and not because it is in reality
   extended to all; for though Christ suffered for the sins of the whole
   world, and is offered through God's benignity indiscriminately to all,
   yet all do not receive him. [174]

   These two words, which he had before used, judgment and grace, may be
   also introduced here in this form, "As it was through God's judgment
   that the sin of one issued in the condemnation of many, so grace will
   be efficacious to the justification of many." Justification of life is
   to be taken, in my judgment, for remission, which restores life to us,
   as though he called it life-giving. [175] For whence comes the hope of
   salvation, except that God is propitious to us; and we must be just, in
   order to be accepted. Then life proceeds from justification. [176]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [173] The meaning of this word is evident here; for it stands in
   contrast with paraptoma -- offense or transgression, in the former
   clause, and is identical in sense with hupakoe -- obedience, in the
   next verse. It means what is appointed and adjudged as right; and hence
   it is rendered "ordinance," Luke 1:6; "judgment," Romans 1:32; and, in
   Romans 5:16, "justification," when it stands opposed to katakrima --
   condemnation, and means absolution, acquittal, as the determination of
   the judge. It signifies here, that what Christ did was according to
   God's appointment; it was something directly contrary to offense or
   transgression; and what it was is explained in the next verse by the
   word "obedience." Wolfius says, that dikaioma is the satisfaction of
   Christ, or his active and passive obedience, Romans 5:19, -- that
   dikaiosune is the merit of Christ, obtained by his death and applied to
   us by faith, Romans 3:22, -- and that dikaiosis is the act of
   justification which follows from the satisfaction of Christ,
   apprehended by faith. -- Ed.

   [174] "Nam etsi passus est Christus pro peccatis totius mundi. atque
   omnibus indifferenter Dei benignitate offertur; non tamen omnes
   apprehendum." It appears from this sentence that Calvin held general
   redemption. -- Ed.

   [175] It is an Hebraistic form of speaking, genitivus effect����s Its
   meaning is that it is a justification unto life, whose end is life, or,
   which issues in life, that is, eternal life, according to its import in
   Romans 5:17, when reigning in life -- en zoHu, is spoken of; and the
   word "eternal," is added to it in the last verse. This life commences
   with justification, and therefore this view includes what Calvin says,
   though it extends farther. -- Ed.

   [176] In our version are introduced "judgment" and "free-gift," from
   verse 16; and it is what has been done by most interpreters. The words
   are found here in no MSS.; but there is another reading countenanced by
   four MSS., as given by Griesbach, and two of them ancient; the word for
   offense is put in the nominative case, to paraptoma, and the word for
   righteousness the same, to dikaioma. Then the reading would be -- 18.
   So then, as through one the transgression was, as to all men, unto
   condemnation; so also through one the righteousness is, as to all men,
   unto justification of life. This agrees better with the following
   verse, though the meaning is substantially the same with what is given
   in our version. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 5:19

   19. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
   obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

   19. Quemadmodum enim per disobedientiam unius hominis peccatores
   constitute sunt multi; sic et per obedientiam unius justi constituentur
   multi.

   19. This is no tautology, but a necessary explanation of the former
   verse. For he shows that we are guilty through the offense of one man,
   in such a manner as not to be ourselves innocent. He had said before,
   that we are condemned; but that no one might claim for himself
   innocence, he also subjoined, that every one is condemned because he is
   a sinner. And then, as he declares that we are made righteous through
   the obedience of Christ, we hence conclude that Christ, in satisfying
   the Father, has provided a righteousness for us. It then follows, that
   righteousness is in Christ, and that it is to be received by us as what
   peculiarly belongs to him. He at the same time shows what sort of
   righteousness it is, by calling it obedience. And here let us
   especially observe what we must bring into God's presence, if we seek
   to be justified by works, even obedience to the law, not to this or to
   that part, but in every respect perfect; for when a just man falls, all
   his former righteousness will not be remembered. We may also hence
   learn, how false are the schemes which they take to pacify God, who of
   themselves devise what they obtrude on him. For then only we truly
   worship him when we follow what he has commanded us, and render
   obedience to his word. Away then with those who confidently lay claim
   to the righteousness of works, which cannot otherwise exist than when
   there is a full and complete observance of the law; and it is certain
   that this is nowhere to be found. We also learn, that they are madly
   foolish who vaunt before God of works invented by themselves, which he
   regards as the filthiest things; for obedience is better than
   sacrifices.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 5:20-21

   20. Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. [177] But
   where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:

   20. Lex vero intervenit, ut abundaret delictum; ubi vero abundavit
   delictum, superabundavit et gratia:

   21. That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
   through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

   21. Quo, sicut regnavit peccatum per mortem, sic et gratia regnet per
   justitiam in vitam ����ternam per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum.

   20. But the law intervened, etc. This subject depends on what he had
   said before -- that there was sin before the law was published. This
   being the case, then follows immediately this question -- For what
   purpose was the law given? It was therefore necessary to solve this
   difficulty; but as a longer digression was not suitable, he deferred
   the subject and handled it in another place: and now by the way he only
   says, that the law entered, [178] that sin might abound; for he
   describes not here the whole office and use of the law, but only
   touches on one part, which served his present purpose. He indeed
   teaches us, that it was needful that men's ruin should be more fully
   discovered to them, in order that a passage might be opened for the
   favor of God. They were indeed shipwrecked before the law was given; as
   however they seemed to themselves to swim, while in their destruction,
   they were thrust down into the deep, that their deliverance might
   appear more evident, when they thence emerge beyond all human
   expectation. Nor was it unreasonable, that the law should be partly
   introduced for this end -- that it might again condemn men already
   condemned; for nothing is more reasonable than that men should, through
   all means be brought, nay, forced, by being proved guilty, to know
   their own evils.

   That offense might abound, etc. It is well known how some, following
   Augustine, usually explain this passage, -- that lust is irritated the
   more, while it is checked by the restraints of the law; for it is man's
   nature to strive for what is forbidden. But I understand no other
   increase to be intended here than that of knowledge and of obstinacy;
   for sin is set by the law before the eyes of man, that he may be
   continually forced to see that condemnation is prepared for him. Thus
   sin disturbs the conscience, which, when cast behind them, men forget.
   And farther, he who before only passed over the bounds of justice,
   becomes now, when the law is introduced, a despiser of God's authority,
   since the will of God is made known to him, which he now wantonly
   tramples under feet. It hence follows, that sin is increased by the
   law, since now the authority of the lawgiver is despised and his
   majesty degraded. [179]

   Grace has superabounded. After sin has held men sunk in ruin, grace
   then comes to their help: for he teaches us, that the abundance of
   grace becomes for this reason more illustrious. -- that while sin is
   overflowing, it pours itself forth so exuberantly, that it not only
   overcomes the flood of sin, but wholly absorbs it. [180] And we may
   hence learn, that our condemnation is not set before us in the law,
   that we may abide in it; but that having fully known our misery, we may
   be led to Christ, who is sent to be a physician to the sick, a
   deliverer to the captives, a comforter to the afflicted, a defender to
   the oppressed. (Isaiah 61:1.)

   21. That as sin has reigned, etc. As sin is said to be the sting of
   death, and as death has no power over men, except on account of sin; so
   sin executes its power by death: it is hence said to exercise thereby
   its dominion. In the last clause the order of the words is deranged,
   but yet not without reason. The simple contrast might have been thus
   formed, -- "That righteousness may reign through Christ." But Paul was
   not content to oppose what is contrary to what is contrary, but adds
   the word grace, that he might more deeply print this truth on the
   memory -- that the whole is to be ascribed, not to our merit, but to
   the kindness of God. [181] He had previously said, that death reigned;
   he now ascribes reigning to sin; but its end or, effect is death. And
   he says, that it has reigned, in the past tense; not that it has ceased
   to reign in those who are born only of flesh, and he thus distinguishes
   between Adam and Christ, and assigns to each his own time. Hence as
   soon as the grace of Christ begins to prevail in any one, the reign of
   sin and death ceases. [182]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] Pleonase, which means to grow more and more, to increase, to
   multiply: it is a different verb from that in the last clause. What he
   calls "offense" or "fall" in this member of the sentence, he calls
   "sin" in the next. It is still "the fall" or "the sin" which caused it:
   for that is the parent of every other sin. -- Ed.

   [178] "Intercessisse legem -- that the law came between," i.e., Adam
   and Christ; pareisolthen from para, with, besides, or between, and
   eiserchomai, to enter. It occurs elsewhere only in Galatians 2:4, where
   it is rendered, "came in privily," as required by the context. But it
   cannot be so rendered here. Schleusner says, that it simply means to
   enter, and that it is so used by Philo. It is thus rendered by the
   Syriac and Arabic versions. Erasmus has "obiter subiit, vel, irrepsit
   -- came, or, crept in by the by;" Hammond has the same; but Beza
   attaches the idea of besides to para, -- pr����terea introiit -- entered
   in besides," i.e., in addition to the disease under which all men
   labored, having been contaminated by that of the first sin. "Intervenit
   -- intervened," is the rendering of Grotius; that is, the law
   intervened between the beginning of sin and the beginning of new
   righteousness. "The law," says Hodge, "was superinduced on a plan
   already laid. It was not designed for the accomplishment of man's
   salvation, that is, either for his justification or sanctification, but
   for the accomplishment of a very subordinate part in the great scheme
   of mercy." -- Ed.

   [179] Chrysostom regarded hina here as denoting not the final cause,
   but the event, and thought the meaning to be, that the law entered, so
   that the effect or event was, that sin increased. Its rendering would
   then be, so that: and this seems to be the meaning given to it by
   Calvin. The law did not create sin, but made it known, and by
   discovering it, increased its guilt when persisted in, and by
   discovering it showed the necessity of a Savior.

   [180] The superabounding has a reference to the increasing of sin by
   means of the law. Grace not only abounded so as to be sufficient to
   remedy the first sin and the sins which followed it; but it abounded
   still more, so as to be an adequate provision for sin when increased by
   the law, through the perverseness of human nature. -- Ed.

   [181] The antithesis to "sin" is properly "righteousness;" but, as
   Calvin observes, "grace" is connected with it. To preserve the
   contrast, the sentence might be rendered, "grace through
   righteousness;" and then to show the medium or channel through which
   this "grace through righteousness" is to reign so as to issue in
   "eternal life," it is added, "through Jesus Christ our Lord." So that
   in this single sentence, we have the origin, "grace," the means or the
   meritorious cause, "righteousness," the agent, or the procurer of it,
   "Jesus Christ," and the end, "eternal life." Some take "grace" as
   antithetic to sin, and connect "righteousness" with "eternal life," and
   render it "justification;" but this does not so well preserve the
   antithetic character of the clause. Those who render it "holiness"
   completely misunderstand the drift of the passage. The first part is
   differently rendered: instead of "unto death," Hammond renders it, like
   Calvin, "through death," and Grotius, "by (per) death." The preposition
   is en and not ei, and its common meaning is "in," and it may be here
   translated, "in death," i.e., in a state of death. The reign of sin was
   that of death and misery; the reign of grace through Christ's
   righteousness is that of life and happiness, which is never to end. --
   Ed.

   [182] That the antitheses of this remarkable passage, from verse 12 to
   the end, may be more clearly seen, it shall be presented in lines. The
   contrast in Romans 5:12 and 20 will be found in the first and last line
   and in the second and the third; and as to all the other verses, in the
   first and the third line and in the second and the fourth, except
   Romans 5:13 and 14, which are an explanation of the 12th. The 17th
   includes the two ideas of the 15th and 16th, in an inverted order. The
   18th and l9th contain the summing up of the argument, -- 12. For this
   reason, -- as by one man sin entered into the world, And death by sin,
   Even so death came upon all men, -- Because all had sinned: 13. Sin
   indeed was until the law in the world, But sin is not imputed when
   there is no law; 14. Yet reign did death from Adam to Moses. Even over
   those who had not sinned, After the likeness of the transgression of
   Adam, Who is the type of him who was to come. 15. But not as the
   transgression, So also the free favor; For if through the transgression
   of one Many died. Much more has God's grace, and his free gift through
   the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, Abounded unto many: 16. And not as
   through one sin, So the free gift; For judgment was indeed Through one
   sir to condemnation, But the free favor Is from many transgressions to
   justification, -- 17. For if for one transgression, Death reigned
   through one; Much more shall they, who receive abundance of grace and
   of the gift of righteousness, Reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.
   18. So then, as through one transgression, Judgment was on all men to
   condemnation; So also through one righteousness, The free favor is on
   all men to justification of life: 19. For as through the disobedience
   of one man, Sinful were made many; So also through the obedience of
   one, Righteous shall be made many. 20. But the law entered in, That
   multiplied might be transgression; But where sin multiplied,
   Superabounded has grace: So that as sin reigned Into death; So also
   grace shall reign through righteousness, Into eternal life, through
   Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 6
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 6:1-2

   1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
   abound?

   1. Quid ergo dicemus? manebimus in peccato, ut gratia abundet?

   2. God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
   therein?

   2. Ne sit ita: qui mortui sumus peccato, quomodo adhuc vivemus in eo?

   1. What then shall we say? Throughout this chapter the Apostle proves,
   that they who imagine that gratuitous righteousness is given us by him,
   apart from newness of life, shamefully rend Christ asunder: nay, he
   goes further, and refers to this objection, -- that there seems in this
   case to be an opportunity for the display of grace, if men continued
   fixed in sin. We indeed know that nothing is more natural than that the
   flesh should indulge itself under any excuse, and also that Satan
   should invent all kinds of slander, in order to discredit the doctrine
   of grace; which to him is by no means difficult. For since everything
   that is announced concerning Christ seems very paradoxical to human
   judgment, it ought not to be deemed a new thing, that the flesh,
   hearing of justification by faith, should so often strike, as it were,
   against so many stumbling-stones. Let us, however, go on in our course;
   nor let Christ be suppressed, because he is to many a stone of offense,
   and a rock of stumbling; for as he is for ruin to the ungodly, so he is
   to the godly for a resurrection. We ought, at the same time, ever to
   obviate unreasonable questions, lest the Christian faith should appear
   to contain anything absurd.

   The Apostle now takes notice of that most common objection against the
   preaching of divine grace, which is this, -- "That if it be true, that
   the more bountifully and abundantly will the grace of God aid us, the
   more completely we are overwhelmed with the mass of sin; then nothing
   is better for us than to be sunk into the depth of sin, and often to
   provoke God's wrath with new offenses; for then at length we shall find
   more abounding grace; than which nothing better can be desired." The
   refutation of this we shall here after meet with.

   2. By no means. To some the Apostle seems to have only intended
   indignantly to reprove a madness so outrageous; but it appears from
   other places that he commonly used an answer of this kind, even while
   carrying on a long argument; as indeed he does here, for he proceeds
   carefully to disprove the propounded slander. He, however, first
   rejects it by an indignant negative, in order to impress it on the
   minds of his readers, that nothing can be more inconsistent than that
   the grace of Christ, the repairer of our righteousness, should nourish
   our vices.

   Who have died to sin, etc. An argument derived from what is of an
   opposite character. "He who sins certainly lives to sin; we have died
   to sin through the grace of Christ; then it is false, that what
   abolishes sin gives vigor to it." The state of the case is really this,
   -- that the faithful are never reconciled to God without the gift of
   regeneration; nay, we are for this end justified, -- that we may
   afterwards serve God in holiness of life. Christ indeed does not
   cleanse us by his blood, nor render God propitious to us by his
   expiation, in any other way than by making us partakers of his Spirit,
   who renews us to a holy life. It would then be a most strange inversion
   of the work of God were sin to gather strength on account of the grace
   which is offered to us in Christ; for medicine is not a feeder of the
   disease, which it destroys. [183] We must further bear in mind, what I
   have already referred to -- that Paul does not state here what God
   finds us to be, when he calls us to an union with his Son, but what it
   behoves us to be, after he has had mercy on us, and has freely adopted
   us; for by an adverb, denoting a future time, he shows what kind of
   change ought to follow righteousness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [183] This phrase, "died to sin," is evidently misapprehended by
   Haldane. Having been offended, and justly so, by an unguarded and
   erroneous expression of Stuart, derived from Chrysostom, and by the
   false rendering of Macknight, he went to another extreme, and
   maintained, that to die, or to be dead to sin, means to be freed from
   its guilt, while the whole context proves, that it means deliverance
   from its power as a master, from the servitude or bondage of sin. To
   live in it, does not mean to live under its guilt, but in its service
   and under its ruling power; and this is what the Apostle represents as
   a contrast to being dead to sin. Not to "serve sin," in Romans 6:6, is
   its true explanation. See also Romans 6:11, 12, and 14. The very
   argument requires this meaning. The question in the first verse, --
   Shall we continue in sin?" does not surely mean -- shall we continue in
   or under the guilt of sin? but in its service, and in the practice of
   it. It was the chapter of practical licentiousness that the Apostle
   rebuts; and he employs an argument suitable to the purpose, "If we are
   dead to sin, freed from it as our master, how absurd it is to suppose
   that we can live any longer in its service?" Then he shows in what
   follows how this had been effected. This is clearly the import of the
   passage, and so taken by almost all commentators. But it must be added,
   that Venema and Chalmers materially agree with Haldane. The former says
   that to "die to sin" is to give to sin what it demands and that is,
   death; and that when this is given, it can require nothing more. In
   this sense, he adds, Christ died to sin (Romans 6:10); and in the same
   sense believers die to sin, being, as they are, united to Christ, his
   death being viewed as their death. However true this theology may be,
   (and Chalmers shows this in his own inimitable manner,) it does not
   seem to be taught here: though there may be something in one or two
   expressions to favor it; yet the whole tenor of the passage, and many
   of the phrases, seem clearly to constrain us to adopt the other view.
   -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 6:3-4

   3. Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
   were baptized into his death?

   3. Num ignoratis quod quicunque baptizati sumus in Christum, in mortem
   ejus baptizati sumus?

   4. Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as
   Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so
   we also should walk in newness of life.

   4. Consepulti ergo sumus ei per baptismum in mortem; ut quemadmodum
   suscitatus est Christus ex mortuis per gloriam Patris, sic et nos in
   novitate vit���� ambulemus.

   3. Know ye not, etc. What he intimated in the last verse -- that Christ
   destroys sin in his people, he proves here by mentioning the effect of
   baptism, by which we are initiated into his faith; for it is beyond any
   question, that we put on Christ in baptism, and that we are baptized
   for this end -- that we may be one with him. But Paul takes up another
   principle -- that we are then really united to the body of Christ, when
   his death brings forth in us its fruit; yea, he teaches us, that this
   fellowship as to death is what is to be mainly regarded in baptism; for
   not washing alone is set forth in it, but also the putting to death and
   the dying of the old man. It is hence evident, that when we become
   partakers of the grace of Christ, immediately the efficacy of his death
   appears. But the benefit of this fellowship as to the death of Christ
   is described in what follows. [184]

   4. We have then been buried with him, etc. He now begins to indicate
   the object of our having been baptized into the death of Christ, though
   he does not yet completely unfold it; and the object is -- that we,
   being dead to ourselves, may become new creatures. He rightly makes a
   transition from a fellowship in death to a fellowship in life; for
   these two things are connected together by an indissoluble knot -- that
   the old man is destroyed by the death of Christ, and that his
   resurrection brings righteousness, and renders us new creatures. And
   surely, since Christ has been given to us for life, to what purpose is
   it that we die with him except that we may rise to a better life? And
   hence for no other reason does he slay what is mortal in us, but that
   he may give us life again.

   Let us know, that the Apostle does not simply exhort us to imitate
   Christ, as though he had said that the death of Christ is a pattern
   which all Christians are to follow; for no doubt he ascends higher, as
   he announces a doctrine, with which he connects, as it is evident, an
   exhortation; and his doctrine is this -- that the death of Christ is
   efficacious to destroy and demolish the depravity of our flesh, and his
   resurrection, to effect the renovation of a better nature, and that by
   baptism we are admitted into a participation of this grace. This
   foundation being laid, Christians may very suitably be exhorted to
   strive to respond to their calling. Farther, it is not to the point to
   say, that this power is not apparent in all the baptized; for Paul,
   according to his usual manner, where he speaks of the faithful,
   connects the reality and the effect with the outward sign; for we know
   that whatever the Lord offers by the visible symbol is confirmed and
   ratified by their faith. In short, he teaches what is the real
   character of baptism when rightly received. So he testifies to the
   Galatians, that all who have been baptized into Christ, have put on
   Christ. (Galatians 3:27.) Thus indeed must we speak, as long as the
   institution of the Lord and the faith of the godly unite together; for
   we never have naked and empty symbols, except when our ingratitude and
   wickedness hinder the working of divine beneficence. [185]

   By the glory of the Father, that is, by that illustrious power by which
   he exhibited himself as really glorious, and as it were manifested the
   greatness of his glory. Thus often is the power of God, which was
   exercised in the resurrection of Christ, set forth in Scripture in
   sublime terms, and not without reason; for it is of great importance,
   that by so explicit a record of the ineffable power of God, not only
   faith in the last resurrection, which far exceeds the perception of the
   flesh, but also as to other benefits which we receive from the
   resurrection of Christ, should be highly commended to us. [186]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [184] "Baptized into (eis) Christ," "baptized into (eis) Moses," 1
   Corinthians 10:2, "baptized into (eis) one body," 1 Corinthians 12:13,
   are all the same forms of expression, and must mean, that by the rite
   of baptism a professed union is made, and, in the two first instances,
   a submission to the authority exercised is avowed. By "baptized into
   his death," we are to understand, "baptized," in order to die with him,
   or to die as he died; not that the death is the same; for it is a like
   death, as it is expressed in Romans 6:5, as the resurrection is a like
   resurrection. His death was natural, ours is spiritual; the same
   difference holds as to the resurrection. It is the likeness that is
   throughout to be regarded; and this is the key to the whole passage. It
   is true, that through the efficacy of Christ's death alone the death of
   his people takes place, and through the operation of his Spirit; but to
   teach this is not the design of the Apostle here; his object seems to
   be merely to show that a change takes place in every true Christian,
   symbolized by baptism, and that this change bears a likeness to the
   death and resurrection of our Savior. He speaks of baptism here not
   merely as a symbol, but as including what it symbolizes; as he does in
   a similar passage, Colossians 2:11, 12, where he refers to this change,
   first under the symbol of circumcision, and then of baptism; which
   clearly proves that the same thing is signified by both. -- Ed.

   [185] That the mode of baptism, immersion, is intimated by "buried,"
   has been thought by most, by Chrysostom, Augustine, Hammond, Pareus,
   Mede, Grotius, Doddridge, Chalmers, and others; while some, such as
   Scott, Stuart, and Hodge, do not consider this as necessarily intended,
   the word "buried" having been adopted to express more fully what is
   meant by being "dead," and there being another word, "planted," used to
   convey the same idea, which cannot be applied to the rite of baptism.
   "Buried with him," means buried like him, or in like manner; and so
   "crucified with him," in Romans 6:6, is the same: sun prefixed to
   verbs, has clearly this meaning. See Romans 8:17; Colossians 3:1; 2
   Timothy 2:11. "Into death" is not to be connected with "planted," but
   with "baptism," it was "a baptism into death,' that is, which
   represented death, even death unto sin. -- Ed.

   [186] Beza takes dia, by, before "glory," in the sense of eis, to, "to
   the glory of the Father;" but this is unusual. It seems to be a
   metonymy, the effect for the cause: it was done by power which
   manifested and redounded to the glory of God. The word "glory, doxa, is
   used for power in John 11:40. The Hebrew word, vz strength, power, is
   sometimes rendered doxa by the Septuagint; see Psalm 68:34; Isaiah
   12:2; 45:24. God's power is often expressly mentioned in connection
   with the resurrection; See 1 Corinthians 6:14, 2 Corinthians 13:4;
   Colossians 1:11. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 6:5-6

   5. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
   we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

   5. Nam si insititii facti sumus similitudini mortis ejus, nimirum et
   resurrectionis participes erimus:

   6. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body
   of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

   6. Illud scientes, quod vetus noster homo simul cum ipso crucifixus
   est. ut aboleretur corpus peccati, ut non ultra serviamus peccato.

   5. For if we have been ingrafted, etc. He strengthens in plainer words
   the argument he has already stated; for the similitude which he
   mentions leaves now nothing doubtful, inasmuch as grafting designates
   not only a conformity of example, but a secret union, by which we are
   joined to him; so that he, reviving us by his Spirit, transfers his own
   virtue to us. Hence as the graft has the same life or death in common
   with the tree into which it is ingrafted, so it is reasonable that we
   should be partakers of the life no less than of the death of Christ;
   for if we are ingrafted according to the likeness of Christ's death,
   which was not without a resurrection, then our death shall not be
   without a resurrection. But the words admit of a twofold explanation,
   -- either that we are ingrafted in Christ into the likeness of his
   death, or, that we are simply ingrafted in its likeness. The first
   reading would require the Greek dative homoiomati, to be understood as
   pointing out the manner; nor do I deny but that it has a fuller
   meaning: but as the other harmonizes more with simplicity of
   expression, I have preferred it; though it signifies but little, as
   both come to the same meaning. Chrysostom thought that Paul used the
   expression, "likeness of death," for death, as he says in another
   place, "being made in the likeness of men." But it seems to me that
   there is something more significant in the expression; for it not only
   serves to intimate a resurrection, but it seems also to indicate this
   -- that we die not like Christ a natural death, but that there is a
   similarity between our and his death; for as he by death died in the
   flesh, which he had assumed from us, so we also die in ourselves, that
   we may live in him. It is not then the same, but a similar death; for
   we are to notice the connection between the death of our present life
   and spiritual renovation.

   Ingrafted, etc. There is great force in this word, and it clearly
   shows, that the Apostle does not exhort, but rather teach us what
   benefit we derive from Christ; for he requires nothing from us, which
   is to be done by our attention and diligence, but speaks of the
   grafting made by the hand of God. But there is no reason why you should
   seek to apply the metaphor or comparison in every particular; for
   between the grafting of trees, and this which is spiritual, a disparity
   will soon meet us: in the former the graft draws its aliment from the
   root, but retains its own nature in the fruit; but in the latter not
   only we derive the vigor and nourishment of life from Christ, but we
   also pass from our own to his nature. The Apostle, however, meant to
   express nothing else but the efficacy of the death of Christ, which
   manifests itself in putting to death our flesh, and also the efficacy
   of his resurrection, in renewing within us a spiritual nature. [187]

   6. That our old man, etc. The old man, as the Old Testament is so
   called with reference to the New; for he begins to be old, when he is
   by degrees destroyed by a commencing regeneration. But what he means is
   the whole nature which we bring from the womb, and which is so
   incapable of the kingdom of God, that it must so far die as we are
   renewed to real life. This old man, he says, is fastened to the cross
   of Christ, for by its power he is slain: and he expressly referred to
   the cross, that he might more distinctly show, that we cannot be
   otherwise put to death than by partaking of his death. For I do not
   agree with those who think that he used the word crucified, rather than
   dead, because he still lives, and is in some respects vigorous. It is
   indeed a correct sentiment, but not suitable to this passage. The body
   of sin, which he afterwards mentions, does not mean flesh and bones,
   but the corrupted mass; for man, left to his own nature, is a mass made
   up of sin. [188]

   He points out the end for which this destruction is effected, when he
   says, so that we may no longer serve sin. It hence follows, that as
   long as we are children of Adam, and nothing more than men, we are in
   bondage to sin, that we can do nothing else but sin; but that being
   grafted in Christ, we are delivered from this miserable thraldom; not
   that we immediately cease entirely to sin, but that we become at last
   victorious in the contest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [187] The word sumphutoi, is rendered insititii by Calvin, and the same
   by Erasmus, Pareus, and Hammond. The Vulgate has "complantati --
   planted together; Beza, "cum eo plantati coaluimus -- being planted
   with him we grow together;" Doddridge, "grow together;" and Macknight,
   "planted together." The word properly means either to grow together, or
   to be born together; and phuo never means to graft. It is only found
   here; and it is applied by the Septuagint, in Zechariah 11:2, to a
   forest growing together. The verb sumphuo is once used in Luke 8:7, and
   refers to the thorns which sprang up with the corn. It occurs as a
   participle in the same sense in the Wisdom of Solomon, 13:13. It
   appears from Wolfius that the word is used by Greek authors in a sense
   not strictly literal, to express congeniality, conjoining, union, as
   the sameness of disposition, or the joining together of a dismembered
   limb, or, as Grotius says, the union of friendship. It might be so
   taken here, and the verse might be thus rendered, -- For if we have
   been united (or, connected) by a similarity to his death, we shall
   certainly be also united by a similarity to his resurrection. The
   genitive case here may be regarded as that of the object, as the love
   of God means sometimes love to God. Evidently the truth intended to be
   conveyed is, that as the Christian's death to sin bears likeness to
   Christ's death, so his rising to a spiritual life is certain to bear a
   similar likeness to Christ's resurrection. Then in the following verses
   this is more fully explained. "The Apostle," says Beza, "uses the
   future tense, we shall be,' because we are not as yet wholly dead, or
   wholly risen, but are daily emerging." But the future here, as Stuart
   remarks, may be considered as expressing what is to follow the death
   previously mentioned, or as designating an obligation, as in Matthew
   4:10; Luke 3:10, 12, 14; or a certainty as to the result. -- Ed.

   [188] It is thought by Pareus and others, that "body" is here assigned
   to "sin," in allusion to the crucifixion that is mentioned, as a body
   in that case is fixed to the cross, and that it means the whole
   congeries, or, as Calvin calls it, the whole mass of sins, such as
   pride, passion, lust, etc. But the reason for using the word "body," is
   more probably this, because he called innate sin, man -- "the old man;"
   and what properly belongs to man is a body. The "body of sin" is a
   Hebraism, and signifies a sinful body. It has no special reference to
   the material body, as Origen thought. The "man" here is to be taken in
   a spiritual sense, as one who has a mind, reason, and affections:
   therefore the body which belongs to him must be of the same character:
   it is the whole of what appertains to "the old man," as he is corrupt
   and sinful, the whole of what is earthly, wicked, and depraved in him.
   It is the sinful body of the old man. -- Ed.

   Romans 6:7-11

   7. For he that is dead is freed from sin.

   7. Qui enim mortuus est, justificatus est a peccato.

   8. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
   with him:

   8. Si vero mortui sumus cum Christo, credimus quod et vivemus cum eo

   9. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death
   hath no more dominion over him.

   9. Scientes quad Christus suscitatus ex mortuis, amplius non moritur,
   mors illi amplius non dominatur:

   10. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth,
   he liveth unto God.

   10. Quod enim mortuus est, peccato mortuus est semel, quod autem vivit,
   vivit Deo.

   11. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
   alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   11. Sic et ipsi ����stimate vosmet esse mortuos quidem peccato, viventes
   autem Deo in Christo Iesu Domino nostro.

   7. For he who has died, etc. This is an argument derived from what
   belongs to death or from its effect. For if death destroys all the
   actions of life, we who have died to sin ought to cease from those
   actions which it exercised during its life. Take justified for freed or
   reclaimed from bondage; for as he is freed from the bond of a charge,
   who is absolved by the sentence of a judge; so death, by freeing us
   from this life, sets us free from all its functions. [189]

   But though among men there is found no such example, there is yet no
   reason why you should think, that what is said here is a vain
   speculation, or despond in your minds, because you find not yourselves
   to be of the number of those who have wholly crucified the flesh; for
   this work of God is not completed in the day in which it is begun in
   us; but it gradually goes on, and by daily advances is brought by
   degrees to its end. So then take this as the sum of the whole, -- "If
   thou art a Christian, there must appear in thee an evidence of a
   fellowship as to the death of Christ; the fruit of which is, that thy
   flesh is crucified together with all its lusts; but this fellowship is
   not to be considered as not existing, because thou findest that the
   relics of the flesh still live in thee; but its increase ought to be
   diligently labored for, until thou arrivest at the goal." It is indeed
   well with us, if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a small
   attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is
   wielded by the Holy Spirit. There is another fellowship as to the death
   of Christ, of which the Apostle often speaks, as he does in 2
   Corinthians 4, that is, the bearing of the cross, which is followed by
   a joint-participation also of eternal life.

   8. But if we have died, etc. He repeats this for no other end but that
   he might subjoin the explanation which follows, that Christ, having
   once risen, dies no more. And hereby he teaches us that newness of life
   is to be pursued by Christians as long as they live; for since they
   ought to represent in themselves an image of Christ, both by crucifying
   the flesh and by a spiritual life, it is necessary that the former
   should be done once for all, and that the latter should be carried on
   continually: not that the flesh, as we have already said, dies in us in
   a moment, but that we ought not to retrograde in the work of crucifying
   it. For if we roll again in our own filth, we deny Christ; of whom we
   cannot be the participators except through newness of life, inasmuch as
   he lives an incorruptible life.

   9. Death no more rules over him, etc. He seems to imply that death once
   ruled over Christ; and indeed when he gave himself up to death for us,
   he in a manner surrendered and subjected himself to its power; it was
   however in such a way that it was impossible that he should be kept
   bound by its pangs, so as to succumb to or to be swallowed up by them.
   He, therefore, by submitting to its dominion, as it were, for a moment,
   destroyed it for ever. Yet, to speak more simply, the dominion of death
   is to be referred to the state of death voluntarily undergone, which
   the resurrection terminated. The meaning is, that Christ, who now
   vivifies the faithful by his Spirit, or breathes his own life into them
   by his secret power from heaven, was freed from the dominion of death
   when he arose, that by virtue of the same dominion he might render free
   all his people.

   10. He died once to sin, etc. What he had said -- that we, according to
   the example of Christ, are for ever freed from the yoke of death, he
   now applies to his present purpose, and that is this -- that we are no
   more subject to the tyranny of sin, and this he proves from the
   designed object of Christ's death; for he died that he might destroy
   sin.

   But we must observe what is suitable to Christ in this form of
   expression; for he is not said to die to sin, so as to cease from it,
   as the words must be taken when applied to us, but that he underwent
   death on account of sin, that having made himself antilutron, a ransom,
   he might annihilate the power and dominion of sin. [190] And he says
   that he died once, not only because he has by having obtained eternal
   redemption by one offering, and by having made an expiation for sin by
   his blood, sanctified the faithful for ever; but also in order that a
   mutual likeness may exist between us. For though spiritual death makes
   continual advances in us, we are yet said properly to die only once,
   that is, when Christ, reconciling us by his blood to the Father,
   regenerates us at the same time by the power of his Spirit.

   But that he lives, etc. Whether you add with or in God, it comes to the
   same meaning; for he shows that Christ lives a life subject to no
   mortality in the immortal and incorruptible kingdom of God; a type of
   which ought to appear in the regeneration of the godly. We must here
   remember the particle of likeness, so; for he says not that we shall
   now live in heaven, as Christ lives there; but he makes the new life,
   which after regeneration we live on earth, similar to his celestial
   life. When he says that we ought to die to sin, according to his
   example, we are not to suppose it to be the same kind of death; for we
   die to sin, when sin dies in us, but it was otherwise with Christ; by
   dying it was that he conquered sin. But he had just said before, that
   we believe that we shall have life in common with him, he fully shows
   by the word believing that he speaks of the grace of Christ: for if he
   only reminded us of a duty, his mode of speaking would have been this,
   "Since we die with Christ, we ought also to live with him." But the
   word believing denotes that he treats here of doctrine which is based
   on the promises; as though he had said, that the faithful ought to feel
   assured that they are through the kindness of Christ dead as to the
   flesh, and that the same Christ will preserve them in newness of life
   to the end. But the future time of the verb live, refers not to the
   last resurrection, but simply denotes the continued course of a new
   life, as long as we peregrinate on the earth.

   11. So count ye also yourselves, etc. Now is added a definition of that
   analogy to which I have referred. For having stated that Christ once
   died to sin and lives for ever to God, he now, applying both to us,
   reminds us how we now die while living, that is, when we renounce sin.
   But he omits not the other part, that is, how we are to live after
   having by faith received the grace of Christ: for though the mortifying
   of the flesh is only begun in us, yet the life of sin is destroyed, so
   that afterwards spiritual newness, which is divine, continues
   perpetually. For except Christ were to slay sin in us at once to the
   end, his grace would by no means be sure and durable.

   The meaning, then, of the words may be thus expressed, "Take this view
   of your case, -- that as Christ once died for the purpose of destroying
   sin, so you have once died, that in future you may cease from sin; yea,
   you must daily proceed with that work of mortifying, which is begun in
   you, till sin be wholly destroyed: as Christ is raised to an
   incorruptible life, so you are regenerated by the grace of God, that
   you may lead a life of holiness and righteousness, inasmuch as the
   power of the Holy Spirit, by which ye have been renewed, is eternal,
   and shall ever continue the same." But I prefer to retain the words of
   Paul, in Christ Jesus, rather than to translate with Erasmus, through
   Christ Jesus; for thus the grafting, which makes us one with Christ, is
   better expressed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [189] This verse has occasioned various explanations. The most obvious
   meaning of the first clause is, that to "die" here means to die with or
   in a similar manner with Christ, for in the next verse, where the idea
   is resumed, "with" or like "Christ," is expressly stated. The verb,
   dedikaiotai, "is," or has been "justified," has been considered by the
   early and most of the later commentators in the sense of being freed or
   delivered. This is the view, among others, of Chrysostom, Basil,
   OEcumenius, Beza, Pareus, Hammond, Grotius, Doddridge and Macknight.
   But it must be added, that it is a meaning of which there is no other
   clear instance in the New Testament, though the verb occurs often.
   Scott, aware of this, gives it its common meaning, "justified;" and
   though he does not take the view of Venema, Chalmers, and Haldane, as
   to the general import of the former part of this chapter, he yet
   considers that to be "justified from sin" here, is to be justified from
   its guilt and penalty. Nor is it irrelevant to the subject in hand to
   refer to justification: for it is a very important truth to declare,
   that to die to sin is an evidence of being justified from its guilt. --
   Ed.

   [190] This difference may be gathered from the general tenor of the
   whole passage; for his death and our death are said to have a likeness,
   and not to be same. And farther, in mentioning our death in this
   connection, in the next verse, he changes his phraseology; it is
   nekrous and not einai, which means those deprived of life -- the
   lifeless. "The dead (nekrous) in trespasses and sins," are those who
   have no spiritual life; and to be dead to sin is not to have life for
   sin, to be freed from its ruling power. See Romans 6:18 It is usual
   with the Apostle to adopt the same form of words in different senses,
   which can only be distinguished by the context or by other parts of
   Scripture, as it has been noticed in a [4]note on Romans 4:25. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 6:12-13

   12. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
   obey it in the lusts thereof.

   12. Ne ergo regnet peccatum in mortali vestro corpore, ut illi
   obediatis in cupiditatibus suis:

   13. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
   unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from
   the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

   13. Neque exhibeatis membra vestra arma injustiti���� peccato, sed
   exhibeatis vosmetipsos Deo, tanquam ex mortuis viventes, et membra
   vestra arma justiti���� Deo.

   12. Let not sin then, etc. He now begins with exhortation, which
   naturally arises from the doctrine which he had delivered respecting
   our fellowship with Christ. Though sin dwells in us, it is inconsistent
   that it should be so vigorous as to exercise its reigning power; for
   the power of sanctification ought to be superior to it, so that our
   life may testify that we are really the members of Christ. I have
   already reminded you that the word body is not to be taken for flesh,
   and skin, and bones, but, so to speak, for the whole of what man is.
   [191] This may undoubtedly be inferred from the passage; for the other
   clause, which he immediately subjoins respecting the members of the
   body, includes the soul also: and thus in a disparaging manner does
   Paul designate earthly man, for owing to the corruption of our nature
   we aspire to nothing worthy of our original. So also does God say in
   Genesis 6:3; where he complains that man was become flesh like the
   brute animals, and thus allows him nothing but what is earthly. To the
   same purpose is the declaration of Christ, "What is born of the flesh
   is flesh." (John 3:6.) But if any makes this objection -- that the case
   with the soul is different; to this the ready answer is -- that in our
   present degenerate state our souls are fixed to the earth, and so
   enslaved to our bodies, that they have fallen from their own
   superiority. In a word, the nature of man is said to be corporeal,
   because he is destitute of celestial grace, and is only a sort of empty
   shadow or image. We may add, that the body, by way of contempt, is said
   by Paul to be mortal, and this to teach us, that the whole nature of
   man tends to death and ruin. Still further, he gives the name of sin to
   the original depravity which dwells in our hearts, and which leads us
   to sin, and from which indeed all evil deeds and abominations stream
   forth. In the middle, between sin and us, he places lusts, as the
   former has the office of a king, while lusts are its edicts and
   commands.

   13. Nor present your members, etc. When once sin has obtained dominion
   in our soul, all our faculties are continually applied to its service.
   He therefore describes here the reign of sin by what follows it, that
   he might more clearly show what must be done by us, if we would shake
   off its yoke. But he borrows a similitude from the military office,
   when he calls our members weapons or arms (arma); [192] as though he
   said, "As the soldier has ever his arms ready, that he may use them
   whenever he is ordered by his general, and as he never uses them but at
   his command; so Christians ought to regard all their faculties to be
   the weapons of the spiritual warfare: if then they employ any of their
   members in the indulgence of depravity, they are in the service of sin.
   But they have made the oath of soldiers to God and to Christ, and by
   this they are held bound: it hence behoves them to be far away from any
   intercourse with the camps of sin." -- Those may also here see by what
   right they proudly lay claim to the Christian name, who have all their
   members, as though they were the prostitutes of Satan, prepared to
   commit every kind of abomination.

   On the other hand, he now bids us to present ourselves wholly to God,
   so that restraining our minds and hearts from all wanderings into which
   the lusts of the flesh may draw us, we may regard the will of God
   alone, being ready to receive his commands, and prepared to execute his
   orders; and that our members also may be devoted and consecrated to his
   will, so that all the faculties both of our souls and of our bodies may
   aspire after nothing but his glory. The reason for this is also added
   -- that the Lord, having destroyed our former life, has not in vain
   created us for another, which ought to be accompanied with suitable
   actions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [191] That is, as a corrupt being: literally it is "for the whole mass
   of man." The "body" here may be the same with that of "the old man" in
   Romans 6:6; and the word for "lusts," epithumiais, is often applied to
   designate the desires of the mind as well as the lusts of the natural
   body. The word, thneto, "mortal," would in this case mean, doomed to
   die, having been crucified; it is a body in the process of dying.
   Innate sin is here personified as a king, a ruler, and as having a
   body, he being "the old man;" and this body is represented as belonging
   to Christians -- "your," as the old man is -- "our old man." -- Ed.

   [192] The idea of a king, a ruler, or a tyrant, is preserved
   throughout. Innate sin is a ruler, carrying on a warfare, and therefore
   has weapons which he employs. In the preceding verse are mentioned the
   gratifications with which he indulges his subjects -- "lusts," here the
   weapons by which he defends his kingdom, and carries on an offensive
   warfare, committing acts of wickedness and wrong -- "weapons of
   injustice, adikias." "He who sins," says an old author, "does wrong
   either to himself or to his neighbor, and always to God." -- Ed.

   Romans 6:14-18

   14. For sin shall not have dominion over you: [193] for ye are not
   under the law, but under grace.

   14. Peccatum enim vobis non dominabitur, non enim estis sub Lege, sed
   Sub gratia.

   15. What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
   under grace? God forbid.

   15. Quid ergo? Peccabimus, quia non sumus sub Lege, sed sub gratia?
   Absit:

   16. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his
   servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
   obedience unto righteousness?

   16. Nescitis quod cui exhibuistis vos servos in obedientiam, ejus servi
   estis cui obeditis, sive peccati in mortem, sive obedienti���� in
   justitiam?

   17. But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have
   obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

   17. Gratia autem Deo, quod fuistis servi peccati, obeditis, vero ex
   animo typo doctrin���� in quem traducti estis:

   18. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
   righteousness.

   18. Manumissi vero peccato, servi facti estis justiti����.

   14. For sin shall not rule over you, etc. It is not necessary to
   continue long in repeating and confuting expositions, which have little
   or no appearance of truth. There is one which has more probability in
   its favor than the rest, and it is this -- that by law we are to
   understand the letter of the law, which cannot renovate the soul, and
   by grace, the grace of the Spirit, by which we are freed from depraved
   lusts. But this I do not wholly approve of; for if we take this
   meaning, what is the object of the question which immediately follows,
   "Shall we sin because we are not under the law?" Certainly the Apostle
   would never have put this question, had he not understood, that we are
   freed from the strictness of the law, so that God no more deals with us
   according to the high demands of justice. There is then no doubt but
   that he meant here to indicate some freedom from the very law of God.
   But laying aside controversy, I will briefly explain my view.

   It seems to me, that there is here especially a consolation offered, by
   which the faithful are to be strengthened, lest they should faint in
   their efforts after holiness, through a consciousness of their own
   weakness. He had exhorted them to devote all their faculties to the
   service of righteousness; but as they carry about them the relics of
   the flesh, they cannot do otherwise than walk somewhat lamely. Hence,
   lest being broken down by a consciousness of their infirmity they
   should despond, he seasonably comes to their aid, by interposing a
   consolation, derived from this circumstance -- that their works are not
   now tested by the strict rule of the law, but that God, remitting their
   impurity, does kindly and mercifully accept them. The yoke of the law
   cannot do otherwise than tear and bruise those who carry it. It hence
   follows, that the faithful must flee to Christ, and implore him to be
   the defender of their freedom: and as such he exhibits himself; for he
   underwent the bondage of the law, to which he was himself no debtor,
   for this end -- that he might, as the Apostle says, redeem those who
   were under the law.

   Hence, not to be under the law means, not only that we are not under
   the letter which prescribes what involves us in guilt, as we are not
   able to perform it, but also that we are no longer subject to the law,
   as requiring perfect righteousness, and pronouncing death on all who
   deviate from it in any part. In like manner, by the word grace, we are
   to understand both parts of redemption -- the remission of sins, by
   which God imputes righteousness to us, -- and the sanctification of the
   Spirit, by whom he forms us anew unto good works. The adversative
   particle, [alla, but,] I take in the sense of alleging a reason, which
   is not unfrequently the case; as though it was said -- "We who are
   under grace, are not therefore under the law."

   The sense now is clear; for the Apostle intended to comfort us, lest we
   should be wearied in our minds, while striving to do what is right,
   because we still find in ourselves many imperfections. For how much
   soever we may be harassed by the stings of sin, it cannot yet overcome
   us, for we are enabled to conquer it by the Spirit of God; and then,
   being under grace, we are freed from the rigorous requirements of the
   law. We must further understand, that the Apostle assumes it as
   granted, that all who are without the grace of God, being bound under
   the yoke of the law, are under condemnation. And so we may on the other
   hand conclude, that as long as they are under the law, they are subject
   to the dominion of sin. [194]

   15. What then? As the wisdom of the flesh is ever clamorous against the
   mysteries of God, it was necessary for the Apostle to subjoin what
   might anticipate an objection: for since the law is the rule of life,
   and has been given to guide men, we think that when it is removed all
   discipline immediately falls to the ground, that restraints are taken
   away, in a word, that there remains no distinction or difference
   between good and evil. But we are much deceived if we think, that the
   righteousness which God approves of in his law is abolished, when the
   law is abrogated; for the abrogation is by no means to be applied to
   the precepts which teach the right way of living, as Christ confirms
   and sanctions these and does not abrogate them; but the right view is,
   that nothing is taken away but the curse, to which all men without
   grace are subject. But though Paul does not distinctly express this,
   yet he indirectly intimates it.

   16. By no means: know ye not? This is not a bare denial as some think,
   as though he preferred to express his abhorrence of such a question
   rather than to disprove it: for a confutation immediately follows,
   derived from a contrary supposition, and to this purpose, "Between the
   yoke of Christ and that of sin there is so much contrariety, that no
   one can bear them both; if we sin, we give ourselves up to the service
   of sin; but the faithful, on the contrary have been redeemed from the
   tyranny of sin, that they may serve Christ: it is therefore impossible
   for them to remain bound to sin." But it will be better to examine more
   closely the course of reasoning, as pursued by Paul.

   To whom we obey, etc. This relative may be taken in a causative sense,
   as it often is; as when one says, -- there is no kind of crime which a
   parricide will not do, who has not hesitated to commit the greatest
   crime of all, and so barbarous as to be almost abhorred even by wild
   beasts. And Paul adduces his reason partly from the effects, and partly
   from the nature of correlatives. For first, if they obey, he concludes
   that they are servants, for obedience proves that he, who thus brings
   one into subjection to himself, has the power of commanding. This
   reason as to service is from the effect, and from this the other
   arises. "If you be servants, then of course sin has the dominion."

   Or of obedience, etc. The language is not strictly correct; for if he
   wished to have the clauses correspondent, he would have said, "or of
   righteousness unto life" [195] But as the change in the words does not
   prevent the understanding of the subject, he preferred to express what
   righteousness is by the word obedience; in which however there is a
   metonymy, for it is to be taken for the very commandments of God; and
   by mentioning this without addition, he intimated that it is God alone,
   to whose authority consciences ought to be subject. Obedience then,
   though the name of God is suppressed, is yet to be referred to him, for
   it cannot be a divided obedience.

   17. But thanks be to God, etc. This is an application of the similitude
   of the present subject. Though they were only to be reminded that they
   were not now the servants of sin, he yet adds a thanksgiving; first,
   that he might teach them, that this was not through their own merit,
   but through the special mercy of God; and secondly, that by this
   thanksgiving, they might learn how great was the kindness of God, and
   that they might thereby be more stimulated to hate sin. And he gives
   thanks, not as to that time during which they were the servants of sin,
   but for the liberation which followed, when they ceased to be what they
   were before. But this implied comparison between their former and
   present state is very emphatical; for the Apostle touches the
   calumniators of the grace of Christ, when he shows, that without grace
   the whole race of man is held captive under the dominion of sin; but
   that the kingdom of sin comes to an end, as soon as grace puts forth
   its power. [196]

   We may hence learn, that we are not freed from the bondage of the law
   that we may sin; for the law does not lose its dominion, until the
   grace of God restores us to him, in order to renew us in righteousness:
   and it is hence impossible that we should be subject to sin, when the
   grace of God reigns in us: for we have before stated, that under this
   term grace, is included the spirit of regeneration.

   You have obeyed from the heart, etc. Paul compares here the hidden
   power of the Spirit with the external letter of the law, as though he
   had said, "Christ inwardly forms our souls in a better way, than when
   the law constrains them by threatening and terrifying us." Thus is
   dissipated the following calumny, "If Christ frees us from subjection
   to the law, he brings liberty to sin." He does not indeed allow his
   people unbridled freedom, that they might frisk about without any
   restraint, like horses let loose in the fields; but he brings them to a
   regular course of life. -- Though Erasmus, following the old version,
   has chosen to translate it the "form" (formam) of doctrine, I have felt
   constrained to retain type, the word which Paul uses: some may perhaps
   prefer the word pattern. [197] It seems indeed to me to denote the
   formed image or impress of that righteousness which Christ engraves on
   our hearts: and this corresponds with the prescribed rule of the law,
   according to which all our actions ought to be framed, so that they
   deviate not either to the right or to the left hand.

   18. And having been made free from sin, etc. The meaning is, "It is
   unreasonable that any one, after having been made free, should continue
   in a state of bondage; for he ought to maintain the freedom which he
   has received: it is not then befitting, that you should be brought
   again under the dominion of sin, from which you have been set at
   liberty by Christ." It is an argument derived from the efficient cause;
   another also follows, taken from the final cause, Ye have been
   liberated from the bondage of sin, that ye might pass into the kingdom
   of righteousness; it is hence right that you should wholly turn away
   from sin, and turn your minds wholly to righteousness, into the service
   of which you have been transferred."

   It must be observed, that no one can be a servant to righteousness
   except he is first liberated by the power and kindness of God from the
   tyranny of sin. So Christ himself testifies,

   "If the Son shall free you, you shall be free indeed."
   (John 8:36.)

   What are then our preparations by the power of free will, since the
   commencement of what is good proceeds from this manumission, which the
   grace of God alone effects?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [193] "Vobis non dominabitur," ou kurieusei -- shall not be a lord over
   you, shall not have power or authority or control over you; or, it may
   mean, shall not domineer over you, so as to retain you, as it were by
   force, under its power: and the reason given favors this idea; for he
   says, "Ye are not under law, but under grace." Law is the strength of
   sin; and by law it binds its subjects under its service. -- Ed.

   [194] The word "law" here, is taken by Scott and others, indefinitely,
   as meaning law as the ground of the covenant of works, written or
   unwritten; and the literal rendering is, "under law" -- hupo nomou; and
   it is the same in the next verse, "under law." -- Ed.

   [195] Beza's remark on this is, -- that obedience is not the cause of
   life, as sin is of death, but is the way to life: and hence the want of
   correspondence in the two clauses. But others, such as Venema,
   Turrettin, and Stuart, consider that the clauses really correspond.
   They take eis thanaton -- "unto death," as signifying, unto
   condemnation; and eis dikaiosunen, they render "unto justification;"
   and hupakoe, "obedience," is in their view the obedience of faith. This
   construction might be admitted, were it not for the last clause of
   Romans 6:18, where we have, "Ye became the servants of righteousness,"
   the same word, dikaiosune; except we consider that also, as Venema
   does, as signifying the righteousness of faith, by a sort of
   personification: and if so, we must attach the same meaning to
   "righteousness" dikaiosune, in Romans 6:19, which issues in, or leads
   to holiness; and also to "righteousness," dikaiosune, in verse 20. As
   the Apostle personifies sin, he may also be supposed to personify
   righteousness, that is, the righteousness of faith. In this case, we
   might as well retain the word "righteousness" in this verse, and not
   justification, which it never strictly means; for the correspondence in
   the terms would be still essentially preserved, as with the
   righteousness of faith eternal life is inseparably connected. -- Ed.

   [196] Our version of this verse conveys the idea, that the Apostle gave
   thanks that they had been the servants of sin; but hoti is often
   rendered for, as in Matthew 5:3, 4; Luke 10:13; and in Matthew 6: 5,
   followed by de as here, in Romans 6:6. The rendering may be this, --
   But thanks be to God; for ye have been the servants of sin, but have
   obeyed the form of doctrine, in which ye have been taught. -- Ed.

   [197] The version of Calvin is, "Obedistis vero et animo typo doctrin����
   in quem traducti estis." The word tupos, is rendered in John 20:25,
   print, that is, of the nails, -- in Acts 7:43, in the plural, fiqures,
   that is, images, -- in Acts 7:44, fashion, that is, pattern or model,
   -- in Hebrews 8:5, pattern, -- in Acts 23:25, manner, that is, form, --
   in Romans 5:14, figure, that is, representative, -- in Titus 2:7,
   pattern; and in all other instances in which it occurs, except in this
   place, it is rendered example, and in the plural, examp1es, as afforded
   by the conduct of others, or by events; see 1 Corinthians 10:6, 11;
   Philippians 3:17; 1 Thessalonians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:9; 1 Timothy
   4:12; 1 Peter 5:3. The idea of mould, which some give to it, is without
   an example in the New Testament. Our version is that of Castellio, in
   the meaning of which most critics agree. Grotius gives this paraphrase,
   "Obedistis ad eum modum quem doctrina evangelii pr����scribit -- Ye became
   obedient to that rule which the doctrine of the gospel prescribes."
   Wolfius quotes from Iamblichus, in his life of Pythagoras, passages in
   which tupos is used for form, model, or manner, --"tos paideuseos ho
   tupos -- the form of instruction;" and "tupos didaskalias -- the form
   or manner of teaching." The grammatical difficulty is best removed by
   Stuart, who considers tupon to be for tupo, the case being changed by
   the preceding pronoun, no uncommon thing in Greek: the literal
   rendering would then be, --"Ye have obeyed the form of doctrine,
   respecting which (or, in which, see Mark 5:34) ye have been
   instructed." -- Ed.

   Romans 6:19

   19. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
   flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and
   to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to
   righteousness unto holiness.

   19. Humanum dico propter infirmitatem carnis vestr����, quemadmodum
   exhibuistis membra vestra serva immunditi���� et iniquitati in
   iniquitatem, sic et nunc exhibite membra vestra serva justiti���� in
   sanctificationem.

   19. I speak what is human, etc. He says that he speaks after the manner
   of men, not as to the substance but as to the manner. So Christ says,
   in John 3:12, that he announced earthly things, while yet he spoke of
   heavenly mysteries, though not so magnificently as the dignity of the
   things required, because he accommodated himself to the capacities of a
   people ignorant and simple. And thus the Apostle says, by way of
   preface, that he might more fully show how gross and wicked is the
   calumny, when it is imagined, that the freedom obtained by Christ gives
   liberty to sin. He reminds the faithful at the same time, that nothing
   is more unreasonable, nay, base and disgraceful, than that the
   spiritual grace of Christ should have less influence over them than
   earthly freedom; as though he had said, "I might, by comparing sin and
   righteousness, show how much more ardently ye ought to be led to render
   obedience to the latter, than to serve the former; but from regard to
   your infirmity I omit this comparison: nevertheless, though I treat you
   with great indulgence, I may yet surely make this just demand -- that
   you should not at least obey righteousness more coldly or negligently
   than you served sin." It is a sort of reticence or silence, a
   withholding of something when we wish more to be understood than what
   we express. He does yet exhort them to render obedience to
   righteousness with so much more diligence, as that which they served is
   more worthy than sin, though he seems not to require this in so many
   words. [198]

   As ye have presented, etc.; that is, "As ye were formerly ready with
   all your faculties to serve sin, it is hence sufficiently evident how
   wretchedly enslaved and bound did your depravity hold you to itself:
   now then ye ought to be equally prompt and ready to execute the
   commands of God; let not your activity in doing good be now less than
   it was formerly in doing evil." He does not indeed observe the same
   order in the antithesis, by adapting different parts to each other, as
   he does in 1 Thessalonians 4:7, where he sets uncleanness in opposition
   to holiness; but the meaning is still evident.

   He mentions first two kinds -- uncleanness and iniquity; the former of
   which is opposed to chastity and holiness, the other refers to injuries
   hurtful to our neighbour. But he repeats iniquity twice, and in a
   different sense: by the first he means plunders, frauds, perjuries, and
   every kind of wrong; by the second, the universal corruption of life,
   as though he had said, "Ye have prostituted your members so as to
   perpetrate all wicked works, and thus the kingdom of iniquity became
   strong in you" [199] By righteousness I understand the law or the rule
   of a holy life, the design of which is sanctification, as the case is
   when the faithful devote themselves to serve God in purity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [198] The phrase is taken differently: Anthropinon lego "I speak what
   is human," that is, what is proportionable to man's strength, says
   Chrysostom -- what is done and known in common life, as in Galatians
   3:15, or, what is moderate, says Hammond -- what is level to man's
   understanding, says Vatablus The first proposed by Hammond is the
   meaning most suitable here; for the Apostle had previously used reasons
   and arguments, and sacred similitudes; but he comes now to what is
   known in common life among men, the connection between masters and
   servants, and he did this in condescension to their weakness, which he
   calls the weakness of the flesh, that is, the weakness of which flesh,
   the depravity of nature, was the cause; it was weakness arising from
   the flesh. -- Ed.

   [199] The different clauses of this verse have been a knotty point to
   all commentators. Probably the Apostle did not intend to keep up a
   regular course of antithesis, the subject not admitting of this;
   because the progress of evil and the progress of its remedy may be
   different, and it seems to be so in the present case. Sin is innate and
   inward, and its character, as here represented, is vileness and
   iniquity, and it breaks out into acts of iniquity: he does not repeat
   the other character, vileness; but when he comes to the contrast he
   mentions holiness, and does not add what is antithetic to iniquity.
   This is a striking instance of the elliptical style of the Apostle. It
   is not neglect or carelessness, but no doubt an intentional omission;
   it being the character of his mode of writing, which he had in common
   with the ancient Prophets. Then comes the word "righteousness," which I
   am disposed to think is that which all along has been spoken of, the
   righteousness of faith; this is not innate, not inward, but which comes
   from without, and is apprehended by faith, by which sins are forgiven,
   and God's favor obtained; and they who become the servants of this are
   to cultivate holiness both inward and outward; they ought to present
   all their members, that is, all their faculties, to the service of this
   master, so that they may become holy in all manner of conversation. But
   if this idea of righteousness be disapproved of, we may still account
   for the apparent irregularity in the construction of the passage. It is
   an instance of an inverted order, many examples of which are found even
   in this Epistle. He begins with "uncleanness," he ends with "holiness,"
   and then the intervening words which are in contrast correspond,
   "iniquity" and "righteousness." Here is also an inversion in the
   meaning; "uncleanness" is the principle, and "holiness" is the action;
   while "iniquity" is the action, and "righteousness" is the principle.
   If this view is right, we have here a singular instance of the inverted
   parallelism, both as to words and meaning. -- Ed.

   Romans 6:20-23

   20. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
   righteousness.

   20. Quando enim servi fuistis peccati, liberi fuistis justiti����.

   21. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
   for the end of those things is death.

   21. Quem ergo fructum habuistis tunc in iis, de quibus nunc
   erubescitis? Siquidem finis eorum mors.

   22. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye
   have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

   22. Nunc vero manumissi a peccato, Deo autem in servitutem addicti,
   habetis fructum vestrum in sanctificationem, finem vero vitam ����ternam.

   23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
   through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   23. Stipendia enim peccati, mors; donum vero Dei, vita ����terna, in
   Christo lesu Domino nostro.

   20. For when ye were, etc. He still repeats the difference, which he
   had before mentioned, between the yoke of righteousness and that of
   sin; for these two things, sin and righteousness, are so contrary, that
   he who devotes himself to the one, necessarily departs from the other.
   And he thus represents both, that by viewing them apart we may see more
   clearly what is to be expected from each; for to set things thus apart
   enables us to understand better their distinctive character. He then
   sets sin on one side, and righteousness on the other; and having stated
   this distinction, he afterwards shows what results from each of them.

   Let us then remember that the Apostle still reasons on the principle of
   contraries, and in this manner, "While ye were the servants of sin, ye
   were freed from righteousness; but now a change having taken place, it
   behoves you to serve righteousness; for you have been liberated from
   the yoke of sin. He calls those free from righteousness who are held by
   no bridle to obey righteousness. This is the liberty of the flesh,
   which so frees us from obedience to God, that it makes us slaves to the
   devil. Wretched then and accursed is this liberty, which with unbridled
   or rather mad frenzy, leads us exultingly to our destruction.

   21. What fruit, then, etc. He could not more strikingly express what he
   intended than by appealing to their conscience, and by confessing shame
   as it were in their person. Indeed the godly, as soon as they begin to
   be illuminated by the Spirit of Christ and the preaching of the gospel,
   do freely acknowledge their past life, which they have lived without
   Christ, to have been worthy of condemnation; and so far are they from
   endeavouring to excuse it, that, on the contrary, they feel ashamed of
   themselves. Yea, further, they call to mind the remembrance of their
   own disgrace, that being thus ashamed, they may more truly and more
   readily be humbled before God.

   Nor is what he says insignificant, Of which ye are now ashamed; for he
   intimates that we are possessed with extreme blind love for ourselves,
   when we are involved in the darkness of our sins, and think not that
   there is so much filth in us. The light of the Lord alone can open our
   eyes to behold the filthiness which lies hid in our flesh. He only then
   is imbued with the principles of Christian philosophy, who has well
   learnt to be really displeased with himself, and to be confounded with
   shame for his own wretchedness. He shows at last still more plainly
   from what was to follow, how much they ought to have been ashamed, that
   is, when they came to understand that they had been standing on the
   very precipice of death, and had been nigh destruction; yea, that they
   would have already entered the gates of death, had they not been
   reclaimed by God's mercy.

   22. Ye have your fruit unto holiness, etc. As he had before mentioned a
   twofold end of sin, so he does now as to righteousness. Sin in this
   life brings the torments of an accusing conscience, and in the next
   eternal death. We now gather the fruit of righteousness, even holiness;
   we hope in future to gain eternal life. These things, unless we are
   beyond measure stupid, ought to generate in our minds a hatred and
   horror of sin, and also a love and desire for righteousness. Some
   render telos, "tribute" or reward, and not "end," but not, as I think,
   according to the meaning of the Apostle; for though it is true that we
   bear the punishment of death on account of sin, yet this word is not
   suitable to the other clause, to which it is applied by Paul, inasmuch
   as life cannot be said to be the tribute or reward of righteousness.

   23. For the wages of sin, etc. There are those who think that, Paul, by
   comparing death to allowances of meat, (obsoniis,) points out in a
   disparaging manner the kind of wretched reward that is allotted to
   sinners, as this word is taken by the Greeks sometimes for portions
   allowed to soldiers. But he seems rather indirectly to condemn the
   blind appetites of those who are ruinously allured by the enticements
   of sin, as the fish are by the hook. It will however be more simple to
   render the word "wages," for surely death is a sufficiently ample
   reward to the wicked. This verse is a conclusion to the former, and as
   it were an epilogue to it. He does not, however, in vain repeat the
   same thing again; but by doubling the terror, he intended to render sin
   an object of still greater hatred.

   But the gift of God. They are mistaken who thus render the sentence,
   "Eternal life is the gift of God," as though eternal life were the
   subject, and the gift of God the predicate; for this does not preserve
   the contrast. But as he has already taught us, that sin produces
   nothing but death; so now he subjoins, that this gift of God, even our
   justification and sanctification, brings to us the happiness of eternal
   life. Or, if you prefer, it may be thus stated, -- "As the cause of
   death is sin, so righteousness, which we obtain through Christ,
   restores to us eternal life."

   It may however be hence inferred with certainty, that our salvation is
   altogether through the grace and mere beneficence of God. He might
   indeed have used other words -- that the wages of righteousness is
   eternal life; and then the two clauses would correspond: but he knew
   that it is through God's gift we obtain it, and not through our own
   merits; and that it is not one or a single gift; for being clothed with
   the righteousness of the Son, we are reconciled to God, and we are by
   the power of the Spirit renewed unto holiness. And he adds, in Christ
   Jesus, and for this reason, that he might call us away from every
   conceit respecting our own worthiness.

   CHAPTER 7
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 7:1-4

   1. Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how
   that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?

   1. Num ignoratis fratres (scientibus enim Legem loquor) quod Lex
   dominatur homini quamdiu vivit?

   2. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her
   husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed
   from the law of her husband.

   2. Nam viro subjecta mulier, viventi viro alligata est per Legem; quod
   si mortuus fuerit vir, soluta est a Lege viri.

   3. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man,
   she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is
   free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married
   to another man.

   3. Proinde vivente marito, si alteri viro conjuncta fuerit, adultera
   vocabitur: quod si mortuus fuerit vir, liberata est a Lege ne amplius
   sit adultera si alteri nupserit.

   4. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the
   body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who
   is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.

   4. Itaque fratres mei, vos quoque mortui estis Legi per corpus Christi,
   ut posthac alterius sitis, ejus qui ex mortuis suscitatus est, ut
   fructificemus Deo. [200]

   Though he had, in a brief manner, sufficiently explained the question
   respecting the abrogation of the law; yet as it was a difficult one,
   and might have given rise to many other questions, he now shows more at
   large how the law, with regard to us, is become abrogated; and then he
   sets forth what good is thereby done to us: for while it holds us
   separated from Christ and bound to itself, it can do nothing but
   condemn us. And lest any one should on this account blame the law
   itself, he takes up and confutes the objections of the flesh, and
   handles, in a striking manner, the great question respecting the use of
   the law. [201]

   1. Know ye not, etc. Let the general proposition be that the law was
   given to men for no other end but to regulate the present life, and
   that it belongs not to those who are dead: to this he afterwards
   subjoins this truth -- that we are dead to it through the body of
   Christ. Some understand, that the dominion of the law continues so long
   to bind us as it remains in force. But as this view is rather obscure,
   and does not harmonize so well with the proposition which immediately
   follows, I prefer to follow those who regard what is said as referring
   to the life of man, and not to the law. The question has indeed a
   peculiar force, as it affirms the certainty of what is spoken; for it
   shows that it was not a thing new or unknown to any of them, but
   acknowledged equally by them all.

   (For to those who know the law I speak.) This parenthesis is to be
   taken in the same sense with the question, as though he had said --
   that he knew that they were not so unskilful in the law as to entertain
   any doubt on the subject. And though both sentences might be understood
   of all laws, it is yet better to take them as referring to the law of
   God, which is the subject that is discussed. There are some who think
   that he ascribes knowledge of the law to the Romans, because the
   largest part of the world was under their power and government; but
   this is puerile: for he addressed in part the Jews or other strangers,
   and in part common and obscure individuals; nay, he mainly regarded the
   Jews, with whom he had to do respecting the abrogation of the law: and
   lest they should think that he was dealing captiously with them, he
   declares that he took up a common principle, known to them all, of
   which they could by no means be ignorant, who had from their childhood
   been brought up in the teaching of the law.

   2. For a woman subject to a man, etc. He brings a similitude, by which
   he proves, that we are so loosed from the law, that it does not any
   longer, properly and by its own right, retain over us any authority:
   and though he could have proved this by other reasons, yet as the
   example of marriage was very suitable to illustrate the subject, he
   introduced this comparison instead of evidence to prove his point. But
   that no one may be puzzled, because the different parts of the
   comparison do not altogether correspond, we are to be reminded, that
   the Apostle designedly intended, by a little change, to avoid the
   invidiousness of a stronger expression. He might have said, in order to
   make the comparison complete, "A woman after the death of her husband
   is loosed from the bond of marriage: the law, which is in the place of
   a husband to us, is to us dead; then we are freed from its power." But
   that he might not offend the Jews by the asperity of his expressions,
   had he said that the law was dead, he adopted a digression, and said,
   that we are dead to the law [202] To some indeed he appears to reason
   from the less to the greater: however, as I fear that this is too
   strained, I approve more of the first meaning, which is simpler. The
   whole argument then is formed in this manner "The woman is bound to her
   living husband by the law, so that she cannot be the wife of another;
   but after the death of her husband she is loosed from the bond of his
   law so, that she is free to marry whom she pleases."

   Then follows the application, --
   The law was, as it were our husband,
   under whose yoke we were kept until it became dead to us:
   After the death of the law Christ received us, that is, he joined us,
   when loosed from the law, to himself:
   Then being united to Christ risen from the dead,
   we ought to cleave to him alone:
   And as the life of Christ after the resurrection is eternal,
   so hereafter there shall be no divorce.

   But further, the word law is not mentioned here in every part in the
   same sense: for in one place it means the bond of marriage; in another,
   the authority of a husband over his wife; and in another, the law of
   Moses: but we must remember, that Paul refers here only to that office
   of the law which was peculiar to the dispensation of Moses; for as far
   as God has in the ten commandments taught what is just and right, and
   given directions for guiding our life, no abrogation of the law is to
   be dreamt of; for the will of God must stand the same forever. We ought
   carefully to remember that this is not a release from the righteousness
   which is taught in the law, but from its rigid requirements, and from
   the curse which thence follows. The law, then, as a rule of life, is
   not abrogated; but what belongs to it as opposed to the liberty
   obtained through Christ, that is, as it requires absolute perfection:
   for as we render not this perfection, it binds us under the sentence of
   eternal death. But as it was not his purpose to decide here the
   character of the bond of marriage, he was not anxious to mention the
   causes which releases a woman from her husband. It is therefore
   unreasonable that anything decisive on this point should be sought
   here.

   4. Through the body of Christ. Christ, by the glorious victory of the
   cross, first triumphed over sin; and that he might do this, it was
   necessary that the handwriting, by which we were held bound, should be
   cancelled. This handwriting was the law, which, while it continued in
   force, rendered us bound to serve [203] sin; and hence it is called the
   power of sin. It was then by cancelling this handwriting that we were
   delivered through the body of Christ -- through his body as fixed to
   the cross. [204] But the Apostle goes farther, and says, that the bond
   of the law was destroyed; not that we may live according to our own
   will, like a widow, who lives as she pleases while single; but that we
   may be now bound to another husband; nay, that we may pass from hand to
   hand, as they say, that is, from the law to Christ. He at the same time
   softens the asperity of the expression, by saying that Christ, in order
   to join us to his own body, made us free from the yoke of the law. For
   though Christ subjected himself for a time of his own accord to the
   law, it is not yet right to say that the law ruled over him. Moreover,
   he conveys to his own members the liberty which he himself possesses.
   It is then no wonder that he exempts those from the yoke of the law,
   whom he unites by a sacred bond to himself, that they may be one body
   in him.

   Even his who has been raised, etc. We have already said, that Christ is
   substituted for the law, lest any freedom should be pretended without
   him, or lest any, being not yet dead to the law, should dare to divorce
   himself from it. But he adopts here a periphrastic sentence to denote
   the eternity of that life which Christ attained by his resurrection,
   that Christians might know that this connection is to be perpetual. But
   of the spiritual marriage between Christ and his Church he speaks more
   fully in Ephesians 6

   That we may bring forth fruit to God. He ever annexes the final cause,
   lest any should indulge the liberty of their flesh and their own lusts,
   under the pretense that Christ has delivered them from the bondage of
   the law; for he has offered us, together with himself, as a sacrifice
   to the Father, and he regenerates us for this end -- that by newness of
   life we may bring forth fruit unto God: and we know that the fruits
   which our heavenly Father requires from us are those of holiness and
   righteousness. It is indeed no abatement to our liberty that we serve
   God; nay, if we desire to enjoy so great a benefit as there is in
   Christ, it will not henceforth be right in us to entertain any other
   thought but that of promoting the glory of God; for which purpose
   Christ has connected us with himself. We shall otherwise remain the
   bond-slaves, not only of the law, but also of sin and of death.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [200] That is, the law by which she was bound to her husband, or, the
   law by which he became her husband. It is an instance of the latitude
   in which the genitive case is used. -- Ed.

   [201] The connection of the beginning of this chapter with Romans 6:14
   deserves to be noticed. He says there, that sin shall not rule over us,
   because we are not under law, but under grace. Then he asks, in Romans
   6:15, "Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace?"
   This last subject, according to his usual mode, he takes up first, and
   discusses it till the end of the chapter: and then in this chapter he
   reassumes the first subject -- freedom from the law. This is a striking
   instance of the Apostle's manner of writing, quite different from what
   is usual with us in the present day. He mentions two things; he
   proceeds with the last, and then goes back to the first. -- Ed.

   [202] This is a plausible reason, derived from Theodoret and
   Chrysostom; but hardly necessary. Commentators have felt much
   embarrassed in applying the illustration given here. The woman is freed
   by the death of the husband; but the believer is represented as freed
   by dying himself. This does not correspond: and if we attend to what
   the Apostle says, we shall see that he did not contemplate such a
   correspondence. Let us notice how he introduces the illustration; "the
   law," he says in the first verse, "rules, or exercises authority, over
   a man while he lives;" and then let us observe the application in
   Romans 7:4, where he speaks of our dying to the law The main design of
   the illustration then was, to show that there is no freedom from a law
   but by death; so that there is no necessity of a correspondence in the
   other parts, As in the case of man and wife, death destroys the bond of
   marriage; so in the case of man and the law, that is, the law as the
   condition of life, there must be a death; else there is no freedom. But
   there is one thing more in the illustration, which the Apostle adopts,
   the liberty to marry another, when death has given a release: The bond
   of connection being broken, a union with another is legitimate. So far
   only is the example adduced to be applied -- death puts an end to the
   right and authority of law; and then the party released may justly form
   another connection. It is the attempt to make all parts of the
   comparison to correspond that has occasioned all the difficulty. -- Ed.

   [203] "Ob����ratos" -- debtors bound to serve their creditors until
   payment is made. -- Ed.

   [204] That his crucified body is intended, is clear from what follows;
   for he is spoken of as having "been raised from the dead." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 7:5-6

   5. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by
   the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.

   5. Quum enim essemus in carne, affectus peccatorum qui sunt per Legem,
   in membris nostris operabantur ad fructificandum morti:

   6. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
   were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
   oldness of the letter.

   6. Nunc vero soluti sumus a Lege, mortui ei in qua detinebamur; ut
   serviamus in novitate spiritus, et non in vetustate liter����.

   5. For when we were, etc. He shows still more clearly by stating the
   contrary effect, how unreasonably the zealots of the law acted, who
   would still detain the faithful under its dominion; for as long as the
   literal teaching of the law, unconnected with the Spirit of Christ,
   rules and bears sway, the wantonness of the flesh is not restrained,
   but, on the contrary, breaks out and prevails. It hence follows, that
   the kingdom of righteousness is not established, except when Christ
   emancipates us from the law. Paul at the same time reminds us of the
   works which it becomes us to do, when set free from the law. As long,
   then, as man is kept under the yoke of the law, he can, as he is
   sinning continually, procure nothing for himself but death. Since
   bondage to the law produces sin only, then freedom, its opposite, must
   tend to righteousness; if the former leads to death, then the latter
   leads to life. But let us consider the very words of Paul.

   In describing our condition during the time we were subject to the
   dominion of the law, he says, that we were in the flesh. We hence
   understand, that all those who are under the law attain nothing else
   but this -- that their ears are struck by its external sound without
   any fruit or effect, while they are inwardly destitute of the Spirit of
   God. They must therefore necessarily remain altogether sinful and
   perverse, until a better remedy succeeds to heal their diseases.
   Observe also this usual phrase of Scripture, to be in the flesh; it
   means to be endued only with the gifts of nature, without that peculiar
   grace with which God favors his chosen people. But if this state of
   life is altogether sinful, it is evident that no part of our soul is
   naturally sound, and that the power of free will is no other than the
   power of casting evil emotions as darts into all the faculties of the
   soul. [205]

   The emotions of sins, [206] which are through the law, etc.; that is,
   the law excited in us evil emotions, which exerted their influence
   through all our faculties; for there is no part which is not subject to
   these depraved passions. What the law does, in the absence of the
   inward teacher, the Spirit, is increasingly to inflame our hearts, so
   that they boil up with lusts. But observe here, that the law is
   connected with the vicious nature of man, the perversity of which, and
   its lusts, break forth with greater fury, the more they are checked by
   the restraints of righteousness. He further adds, that as long as the
   emotions of the flesh were under the dominion of the law they brought
   forth fruit to death; and he adds this to show that the law by itself
   is destructive. It hence follows, that they are infatuated, who so much
   desire this bondage which issues in death.

   6. But now we have been loosed from the law, etc. He pursues the
   argument derived from the opposite effect of things, -- "If the
   restraint of the law availed so little to bridle the flesh, that it
   became rather the exciter of sin; then, that we may cease from sin, we
   must necessarily be freed from the law." Again, "If we are freed from
   the bondage of the law for this end, that we may serve God; then,
   perversely do they act who hence take the liberty to indulge in sin;
   and falsely do they speak who teach, that by this means loose reins are
   given to lusts." Observe, then, that we are then freed from the law,
   when God emancipates us from its rigid exactions and curse, and endues
   us with his Spirit, through whom we walk in his ways. [207]

   Having died to that, etc. This part contains a reason, or rather,
   indicates the manner in which we are made free; for the law is so far
   abrogated with regard to us, that we are not pressed down by its
   intolerable burden, and that its inexorable rigor does not overwhelm us
   with a curse. [208] -- In newness of spirit; He sets the spirit in
   opposition to the letter; for before our will is formed according to
   the will of God by the Holy Spirit, we have in the law nothing but the
   outward letter, which indeed bridles our external actions, but does not
   in the least restrain the fury of our lusts. And he ascribes newness to
   the Spirit, because it succeeds the old man; as the letter is called
   old, because it perishes through the regeneration of the Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [205] To be "in the flesh" has two meanings, -- to be unrenewed, and in
   our natural corrupt state, as Calvin says, see Romans 8:8, -- and to be
   subject to external rites and ceremonies as the Jews were, see
   Galatians 3:3; Philippians 3:4. Its meaning here, according to Beza and
   Pareus, is the first; according to Grotius and Hammond, the second; and
   according to Turrettin and Hodge, both are included, as the context, in
   their view, evidently shows. -- Ed.

   [206] "Affectus peccatorum -- affections of sins;" ta pathemata, etc.,
   -- "cupiditates -- desires," or lusts, Grotius.. The word is commonly
   taken passively, as signifying afflictions, sufferings; Romans 8:18; 2
   Corinthians 1:5; Colossians 1:24; but here, and in Galatians 5:24, it
   evidently means excitements, commotions, emotions, lusts or lustings.
   "Passion" in our language admits of two similar meanings -- suffering,
   and an excited feeling, or an inward commotion. These "emotions" are
   said to be through the law, -- "made known by the law," says
   Chrysostom; but "occasioned by the law," is more correct, as it appears
   from Romans 7:8, or, "made to abound by the law," as in Romans 5:20.
   The law, instead of making men holy, made them, through the perversity
   of human nature, to sin the more. "Emotions of sins" is an Hebraism for
   "sinful emotions" -- "The members" are those of the "old man," and not
   those of the material body, though it is commonly thought that they are
   the latter, and mentioned, because they are employed as the instruments
   of sin: but there are many sins, and those of the worst kind, which are
   confined to the mind and heart. It is therefore more consistent to
   regard them as the members of "the body of sin," Romans 6:6. -- Ed.

   [207] That the moral, and not the ceremonial law, is meant here, is
   incontestably evident from what the Apostle adds in the following
   verses. He quotes the moral law in the next verse; he calls this law,
   in Romans 7:10, the commandment, ten entolen, which was unto life, see
   Matthew 19:16; and he says, that "by it" sin "slew" him, which could
   not have been said of the ceremonial law. -- Ed.

   [208] Our common version is evidently incorrect as to this clause. The
   pronoun auto or ekeino, is to be supplied. There is an exactly similar
   ellipsis in Romans 6:21 Beza and several others, as well as our
   version, have followed a reading, apothanonto, which Griesbach
   disregards as of no authority; and it is inconsistent with the usual
   phraseology of the Apostle. See Romans 7:4, and Galatians 2:19. -- Ed.

   Romans 7:7-8

   7. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
   known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had
   said, Thou shalt not covet [209]

   7. Quid ergo dicemus? Lex peccatum est? Absit: sed peccatum non cognovi
   nisi per Legem: concupiscentiam enim non noveram, nisi Lex diceret, Non
   concupisces

   8. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
   manner of concupiscence. ...

   8. Occasione autem sumpta, peccatum per mandatum effecit in me omnem
   concupiscentiam.

   7. What then shall we say? Since it has been said that we must be freed
   from the law, in order that we may serve God in newness of spirit, it
   seemed as though this evil belonged to the law, -- that it leads us to
   sin. But as this would be above measure inconsistent, the Apostle
   rightly undertook to disprove it. Now when he adds, Is the law sin?
   what he means is, "Does it so produce sin that its guilt ought to be
   imputed to the law?" -- But sin I knew not, except through the law; sin
   then dwells in us, and not in the law; for the cause of it is the
   depraved lust of our flesh, and we come to know it by the knowledge of
   God's righteousness, which is revealed to us in the law. [210] You are
   not indeed to understand, that no difference whatever can be known
   between right and wrong without the law; but that without the law we
   are either too dull of apprehension to discern our depravity, or that
   we are made wholly insensible through self-flattery, according to what
   follows, --

   For coveting I had not known, etc. This is then an explanation of the
   former sentence, by which he proves that ignorance of sin, of which he
   had spoken, consisted in this -- that he perceived not his own
   coveting. And he designedly referred to this one kind of sin, in which
   hypocrisy especially prevails, which has ever connected with itself
   supine self-indulgence and false assurance. For men are never so
   destitute of judgment, but that they retain a distinction in external
   works; nay, they are constrained even to condemn wicked counsels and
   sinister purposes: and this they cannot do, without ascribing to a
   right object its own praise. But coveting is more hidden and lies
   deeper; hence no account is made of it, as long as men judge according
   to their perceptions of what is outward. He does not indeed boast that
   he was free from it; but he so flattered himself, that he did not think
   that this sin was lurking in his heart. For though for a time he was
   deceived, and believed not that righteousness would be violated by
   coveting, he yet, at length, understood that he was a sinner, when he
   saw that coveting, from which no one is free, was prohibited by the
   law.

   Augustine says, that Paul included in this expression the whole law;
   which, when rightly understood, is true: for when Moses had stated the
   things from which we must abstain, that we may not wrong our neighbor,
   he subjoined this prohibition as to coveting, which must be referred to
   all the things previously forbidden. There is no doubt but that he had
   in the former precepts condemned all the evil desires which our hearts
   conceive; but there is much difference between a deliberate purpose,
   and the desires by which we are tempted. God then, in this last
   command, requires so much integrity from us, that no vicious lust is to
   move us to evil, even when no consent succeeds. Hence it was, that I
   have said, that Paul here ascends higher than where the understanding
   of men can carry them. But civil laws do indeed declare, that
   intentions and not issues are to be punished. Philosophers also, with
   greater refinement, place vices as well as virtues in the soul. But
   God, by this precept, goes deeper and notices coveting, which is more
   hidden than the will; and this is not deemed a vice. It was pardoned
   not only by philosophers, but at this day the Papists fiercely contend,
   that it is no sin in the regenerate. [211] But Paul says, that he had
   found out his guilt from this hidden disease: it hence follows, that
   all those who labor under it, are by no means free from guilt, except
   God pardons their sin. We ought, at the same time, to remember the
   difference between evil lustings or covetings which gain consent, and
   the lusting which tempts and moves our hearts, but stops in the midst
   of its course.

   8. But an occasion being taken, etc. From sin, then, and the corruption
   of the flesh, proceeds every evil; the law is only the occasion. And
   though he may seem to speak only of that excitement, by which our
   lusting is instigated through the law, so that it boils out with
   greater fury; yet I refer this chiefly to the knowledge the law
   conveys; as though he had said, "It has discovered to me every lust or
   coveting which, being hid, seemed somehow to have no existence." I do
   not yet deny, but that the flesh is more sharply stimulated to lusting
   by the law, and also by this means more clearly shows itself; which may
   have been also the case with Paul: but what I have said of the
   knowledge it brings, seems to harmonize better with the context; [212]
   for he immediately subjoins --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [209] Perhaps the sentence ought to have been rendered, For lust
   (concupiscentiam) I had not known, except the law had said, "Thou shalt
   not lust" (non concupisces.) Then the word "coveting" in the next verse
   should be "lust" (concupiscentiam.) But "Thou shalt not covet," is the
   commandment; and to retain a similarity of idea, for the lack of a more
   suitable word, it seems necessary to have coveting, as covetousness has
   not the meaning here intended. There is the same correspondence in the
   words in Greek as in Calvin's Latin. The noun is rendered first in our
   version "lust," and then "concupiscence;" and the same is done by
   Doddridge; the "strong desire" of Macknight is by no means suitable;
   the "inordinate desire" of Stuart is better, though "Thou shalt not
   lust" cannot be approved. By epithumia, desire, is meant the inward
   propensity that is sinful, It is called "sin" in the preceding clause;
   and, according to the usual stage of the Apostle, to show what sin was
   intended, it is called here desire: it is then sin in the wish, in the
   inclination or disposition within. And this very sinful desire the
   tenth commandment distinctly forbids. -- Ed.

   [210] It was the saying of Ambrose, "Lex index peccati est, non
   genitrix -- the law is the discoverer, not the begetter of sin." "The
   law,' says Pareus, "prohibits sin; it is not then the cause of it: sin
   is made known by the law; it is not then by the law produced." -- Ed.

   [211] As an instance of the frivolous and puerile mode of reasoning
   adopted by the Papists, the following may be adduced: quoting James
   1:15, "When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when
   it is finished, bringeth forth death," they reason thus: -- "Lust is
   not simply a sin, for it brings it forth; and when it is sin, it is not
   mortal sin, for it afterwards brings forth death. "Taking advantage of
   a metaphor, they apply it strictly and literally, without considering
   that the Apostle is only exhibiting the rise, progress, and termination
   -- of what? of sin no doubt. The like produces its like. If lust were
   not sinful, it could not generate what is sinful. Such childish and
   profane reasoning is an outrage both on common sense and on religion.
   -- Ed.

   [212] Most commentators take the opposite view, -- that the irritation
   of sin occasioned by the law is more especially meant here. The two
   ideas, the knowledge and the excitement, or the increase of sin by the
   law, are no doubt referred to by the Apostle in these verses. -- Ed.

   Romans 7:8-12

   8. For without the law sin was dead. [213]

   8. Sine Lege enim peccatum est mortuum:

   9. For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came,
   sin revived, and I died.

   9. Ego autem vivebam sine Lege aliquando [214] adveniente autem
   mandato, peccatum revixit,

   10. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto
   death.

   10. Ego autem mortuus sum; et deprehensum est a me mandatum quod erat
   in vitam, cedere in mortem.

   11. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it
   slew me

   11. Peccatum enim, occasione sumpta per mandatum, abduxit me a via et
   per illud occidit:

   12. Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and
   good.

   12. Itaque Lex quidem sancta, et mandatum sanctum, et justum et bonum.

   8. For without the law, etc. He expresses most clearly the meaning of
   his former words; for it is the same as though he had said, that the
   knowledge of sin without the law is buried. It is a general truth,
   which he presently applies to his own case. I hence wonder what could
   have come into the minds of interpreters to render the passage in the
   preterimperfect tense, as though Paul was speaking of himself; for it
   is easy to see that his purpose was to begin with a general
   proposition, and then to explain the subject by his own example.

   9. For I was alive, etc. He means to intimate that there had been a
   time when sin was dead to him or in him. But he is not to be understood
   as though he had been without law at any time, but this word I was
   alive has a peculiar import; for it was the absence of the law that was
   the reason why he was alive; that is, why he being inflated with a
   conceit as to his own righteousness, claimed life to himself while he
   was yet dead. That the sentence may be more clear, state it thus, "When
   I was formerly without the law, I was alive." But I have said that this
   expression is emphatic; for by imagining himself great, he also laid
   claim to life. The meaning then is this, "When I sinned, having not the
   knowledge of the law, the sin, which I did not observe, was so laid to
   sleep, that it seemed to be dead; on the other hand, as I seemed not to
   myself to be a sinner, I was satisfied with myself, thinking that I had
   a life of mine own." But the death of sin is the life of man, and again
   the life of sin is the death of man.

   It may be here asked, what time was that when through his ignorance of
   the law, or as he himself says, through the absence of it, he
   confidently laid claim to life. It is indeed certain, that he had been
   taught the doctrine of the law from his childhood; but it was the
   theology of the letter, which does not humble its disciples, for as he
   says elsewhere, the veil interposed so that the Jews could not see the
   light of life in the law; so also he himself, while he had his eyes
   veiled, being destitute of the Spirit of Christ, was satisfied with the
   outward mask of righteousness. Hence he represents the law as absent,
   though before his eyes, while it did not really impress him with the
   consciousness of God's judgment. Thus the eyes of hypocrites are
   covered with a veil, that they see not how much that command requires,
   in which we are forbidden to lust or covet.

   But when the commandment came, etc. So now, on the other hand, he sets
   forth the law as coming when it began to be really understood. It then
   raised sin as it were from be dead; for it discovered to Paul how great
   depravity abounded in the recesses of his heart, and at the same time
   it slew him. We must ever remember that he speaks of that inebriating
   confidence in which hypocrites settle, while they flatter themselves,
   because they overlook their sins.

   10. Was found by me, etc. Two things are stated here -- that the
   commandment shows to us a way of life in the righteousness of God, and
   that it was given in order that we by keeping the law of the Lord might
   obtain eternal life, except our corruption stood in the way. But as
   none of us obey the law, but, on the contrary, are carried headlong on
   our feet and hands into that kind of life from which it recalls us, it
   can bring us nothing but death. We must thus distinguish between the
   character of the law and our own wickedness. It hence follows, that it
   is incidental that the law inflicts on us a deadly wound, as when an
   incurable disease is more exasperated by a healing remedy. I indeed
   allow that it is an inseparable incident, and hence the law, as
   compared with the gospel, is called in another place the ministration
   of death; but still this remains unaltered, that it is not in its own
   nature hurtful to us, but it is so because our corruption provokes and
   draws upon us its curse.

   11. Led me out of the way, etc. It is indeed true, that while the will
   of God is hid from us, and no truth shines on us, the life of men goes
   wholly astray and is full of errors; nay, we do nothing but wander from
   the right course, until the law shows to us the way of living rightly:
   but as we begin then only to perceive our erroneous course, when the
   Lord loudly reproves us, Paul says rightly, that we are led out of the
   way, when sin is made evident by the law. Hence the verb, exapatan,
   must be understood, not of the thing itself, but of our knowledge; that
   is, that it is made manifest by the law how much we have departed from
   the right course. It must then be necessarily rendered, led me out of
   the way; for hence sinners, who before went on heedlessly, loathe and
   abominate themselves, when they perceive, through the light which the
   law throws on the turpitude of sin, that they had been hastening to
   death. But he away introduces the word occasion, and for this purpose
   -- that we may know that the law of itself does not bring death, but
   that this happens through something else, and that this is as it were
   adventitious. [215]

   12. So then the law is indeed holy, etc. Some think that the words law
   and commandment is a repetition of the same thing; with whom I agree;
   [216] and I consider that there is a peculiar force in the words, when
   he says, that the law itself and whatever is commanded in the law, is
   holy, and therefore to be regarded with the highest reverence, -- that
   it is just, and cannot therefore be charged with anything wrong, --
   that it is good, and hence pure and free from everything that can do
   harm. He thus defends the law against every charge of blame, that no
   one should ascribe to it what is contrary to goodness, justice, and
   holiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [213] This clause is rightly separated from the former verse; for it
   clearly announces what is illustrated in the following verses. "Without
   the law," means without the knowledge of the law. The law is known and
   not known still. -- Ed.

   [214] "Aliquando;" pote -- formerly, while he was a Pharisee, when be
   thought himself blameless. Critics often make difficulties when there
   are none. What is said here of being alive without the law, or when the
   law is not known, and of the commandment supposed to be for life being
   found to be unto death, is still exemplified in the character of men,
   and takes place in the experience of all who are brought out of
   darkness, as Paul was, unto marvellous light. Experience is often the
   best expositor. To understand this passage, no more is necessary than
   to read what Paul says of himself in Philippians 3:9; and also in
   Galatians 2:19. -- Ed.

   [215] This verse will be better understood if we consider it as in a
   manner a repetition, in another form, of what the former verse
   contains, and this is perfectly consistent with the usual manner of the
   Apostle. His object seems to have been to prevent a misapprehension of
   what he had said, that the commandment which was for life proved to be
   unto death. He hence says, that sin availed itself of the commandment,
   and by it deceived him, that is, promised him life, and then by it
   killed him, that is, proved fatal to him. There is a correspondence in
   meaning between the commandment unto life and deceiving, and between
   death and killing. In Romans 7:8, sin, as a person, is said to take
   advantage of the commandment to work every kind of sinful desires: but
   it is said here to take this advantage to deceive by promising life,
   and then to destroy, to expose, and subject him to death and misery. --
   Ed.

   [216] This is doubtless true, and it is an example of what the
   Apostle's manner of writing is, it being that of the ancient prophets.
   How various are the words used in the 119th Psalm to designate the law
   or the revealed will of God? and two different words are often used in
   the same verse. Having spoken of the law in connection with sin, the
   Apostle may be supposed to have had the character of sin in view in
   characterizing the law. Sin works depraved desires and lusts; the law
   is holy: sin deceives and acts the traitor, the law is plain-dealing
   and just: sin leads to death and misery; the law is good and leads to
   happiness. The last contrast is evident from what follows in the next
   verse, "Was that which is good made death unto me?" -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 7:13

   13. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
   sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is
   good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

   13. Quod ergo bonum est, mihi in mortem cessit? Absit: imo peccatum, ut
   appareat peccatum, per bonum operatur mihi mortem: ut fiat super modum
   peccans peccatum per mandatum.

   13. Has then what is good, etc. He had hitherto defended the law from
   calumnies, but in such a manner, that it still remained doubtful
   whether it was the cause of death; nay, the minds of men were on this
   point perplexed, -- how could it be that nothing but death was gained
   from so singular a gift of God. To this objection then he now gives an
   answer; and he denies, that death proceeds from the law, though death
   through its means is brought on us by sin. And though this answer seems
   to militate in appearance against what he had said before -- that he
   had found the commandment, which was given for life, to be unto death,
   there is yet no contrariety. He had indeed said before, that it is
   through our wickedness that the law is turned to our destruction, and
   that contrary to its own character; but here he denies, that it is in
   such a sense the cause of death, that death is to be imputed to it. In
   2 Corinthians 3 he treats more fully of the law. He there calls it the
   ministration of death; but he so calls it according to what is commonly
   done in a dispute, and represents, not the real character of the law,
   but the false opinion of his opponents. [217]

   But sin, etc. With no intention to offend others, I must state it as my
   opinion, that this passage ought to be read as I have rendered it, and
   the meaning is this, -- "Sin is in a manner regarded as just before it
   is discovered by the law; but when it is by the law made known, then it
   really obtains its own name of sin; and hence it appears the more
   wicked, and, so to speak, the more sinful, because it turns the
   goodness of the law, by perverting it, to our destruction; for that
   must be very pestiferous, which makes what is in its own nature
   salutary to be hurtful to us." The import of the whole is -- that it
   was necessary for the atrocity of sin to be discovered by the law; for
   except sin had burst forth into outrageous, or, as they say, into
   enormous excess, it would not have been acknowledged as sin; and the
   more outrageous does its enormity appear, when it converts life into
   death; and thus every excuse is taken away from it. [218]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [217] This can hardly be admitted. The Apostle in Corinthians evidently
   states a fact, as he often does, without going into an explanation; and
   the fact was, that the law proved to be the ministration of death: but
   it proved to be so through the sin and wickedness of man. -- Ed.

   [218] Erasmus, Beza, Pareus, Stuart, and others, make up the ellipsis
   by putting in, "was made death to me," after "sin." But there is no
   need of adding anything. The sentence throughout is thoroughly
   Hebraistic. What is partially announced in the words, "that it might
   appear sin," or, to be sin, etc., is more fully stated in the last
   clause; and the participle, "working" -- katergazomene, is used instead
   of a verb, the auxiliary verb being understood. See similar instances
   in Romans 14:9-13 Calvin's version is no doubt the correct one. What
   follows the last hina more fully explains what comes after the first.
   -- Ed.

   venditus sub peccato.

   16. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it
   is good.

   16. Si vero quod nolo, hoe facio, consentio Legi Dei quod sit bona.

   17. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

   17. Nunc vero non jam illud operor ego, sed quod habitat in me
   peccatum.

   14. For we know that the law, etc. He now begins more closely to
   compare the law with what man is, that it may be more clearly
   understood whence the evil of death proceeds. He then sets before us an
   example in a regenerate man, in whom the remnants of the flesh are
   wholly contrary to the law of the Lord, while the spirit would gladly
   obey it. But first, as we have said, he makes only a comparison between
   nature and the law. Since in human things there is no greater discord
   than between spirit and flesh, the law being spiritual and man carnal,
   what agreement can there be between the natural man and the law? Even
   the same as between darkness and light. But by calling the law
   spiritual, he not only means, as some expound the passage, that it
   requires the inward affections of the heart; but that, by way of
   contrast, it has a contrary import to the word carnal [219] These
   interpreters give this explanation, "The law is spiritual, that is, it
   binds not only the feet and hands as to external works, but regards the
   feelings of the heart, and requires the real fear of God."

   But here a contrast is evidently set forth between the flesh and the
   spirit. And further, it is sufficiently clear from the context, and it
   has been in fact already shown, that under the term flesh is included
   whatever men bring from the womb; and flesh is what men are called, as
   they are born, and as long as they retain their natural character; for
   as they are corrupt, so they neither taste nor desire anything but what
   is gross and earthly. Spirit, on the contrary, is renewed nature, which
   God forms anew after his own image. And this mode of speaking is
   adopted on this account -- because the newness which is wrought in us
   is the gift of the Spirit.

   The perfection then of the doctrine of the law is opposed here to the
   corrupt nature of man: hence the meaning is as follows, "The law
   requires a celestial and an angelic righteousness, in which no spot is
   to appear, to whose clearness nothing is to be wanting: but I am a
   carnal man, who can do nothing but oppose it." [220] But the exposition
   of Origen, which indeed has been approved by many before our time, is
   not worthy of being refuted; he says, that the law is called spiritual
   by Paul, because the Scripture is not to be understood literally. What
   has this to do with the present subject?

   Sold under sin. By this clause he shows what flesh is in itself; for
   man by nature is no less the slave of sin, than those bondmen, bought
   with money, whom their masters ill treat at their pleasure, as they do
   their oxen and their asses. We are so entirely controlled by the power
   of sin, that the whole mind, the whole heart, and all our actions are
   under its influence. Compulsion I always except, for we sin
   spontaneously, as it would be no sin, were it not voluntary. But we are
   so given up to sin, that we can do willingly nothing but sin; for the
   corruption which bears rule within us thus drives us onward. Hence this
   comparison does not import, as they say, a forced service, but a
   voluntary obedience, which an inbred bondage inclines us to render.

   15. For what I do I know not, etc. He now comes to a more particular
   case, that of a man already regenerated; [221] in whom both the things
   which he had in view appear more clearly; and these were, -- the great
   discord there is between the Law of God and the natural man, -- and how
   the law does not of itself produce death. For since the carnal man
   rushes into sin with the whole propensity of his mind, he seems to sin
   with such a free choice, as though it were in his power to govern
   himself; so that a most pernicious opinion has prevailed almost among
   all men -- that man, by his own natural strength, without the aid of
   Divine grace, can choose what he pleases. But though the will of a
   faithful man is led to good by the Spirit of God, yet in him the
   corruption of nature appears conspicuously; for it obstinately resists
   and leads to what is contrary. Hence the case of a regenerated man is
   the most suitable; for by this you may know how much is the contrariety
   between our nature and the righteousness of the law. From this case,
   also, a proof as to the other clause may more fitly be sought, than
   from the mere consideration of human nature; for the law, as it
   produces only death in a man wholly carnal, is in him more easily
   impeached, for it is doubtful whence the evil proceeds. In a regenerate
   man it brings forth salutary fruits; and hence it appears, that it is
   the flesh only that prevents it from giving life: so far it is from
   producing death of itself.

   That the whole, then, of this reasoning may be more fully and more
   distinctly understood, we must observe, that this conflict, of which
   the Apostle speaks, does not exist in man before he is renewed by the
   Spirit of God: for man, left to his own nature, is wholly borne along
   by his lusts without any resistance; for though the ungodly are
   tormented by the stings of conscience, and cannot take such delight in
   their vices, but that they have some taste of bitterness; yet you
   cannot hence conclude, either that evil is hated, or that good is loved
   by them; only the Lord permits them to be thus tormented, in order to
   show to them in a measure his judgment; but not to imbue them either
   with the love of righteousness or with the hatred of sin.

   There is then this difference between them and the faithful -- that
   they are never so blinded and hardened, but that when they are reminded
   of their crimes, they condemn them in their own conscience; for
   knowledge is not so utterly extinguished in them, but that they still
   retain the difference between right and wrong; and sometimes they are
   shaken with such dread under a sense of their sin, that they bear a
   kind of condemnation even in this life: nevertheless they approve of
   sin with all their heart, and hence give themselves up to it without
   any feeling of genuine repugnance; for those stings of conscience, by
   which they are harassed, proceed from opposition in the judgment,
   rather than from any contrary inclination in the will. The godly, on
   the other hand, in whom the regeneration of God is begun, are so
   divided, that with the chief desire of the heart they aspire to God,
   seek celestial righteousness, hate sin, and yet they are drawn down to
   the earth by the relics of their flesh: and thus, while pulled in two
   ways, they fight against their own nature, and nature fights against
   them; and they condemn their sins, not only as being constrained by the
   judgment of reason, but because they really in their hearts abominate
   them, and on their account loathe themselves. This is the Christian
   conflict between the flesh and the spirit of which Paul speaks in
   Galatians 5:17.

   It has therefore been justly said, that the carnal man runs headlong
   into sin with the approbation and consent of the whole soul; but that a
   division then immediately begins for the first time, when he is called
   by the Lord and renewed by the Spirit. For regeneration only begins in
   this life; the relics of the flesh which remain, always follow their
   own corrupt propensities, and thus carry on a contest against the
   Spirit.

   The inexperienced, who consider not the subject which the Apostle
   handles, nor the plan which he pursues, imagine, that the character of
   man by nature is here described; and indeed there is a similar
   description of human nature given to us by the Philosophers: but
   Scripture philosophizes much deeper; for it finds that nothing has
   remained in the heart of man but corruption, since the time in which
   Adam lost the image of God. So when the Sophisters wish to define
   free-will, or to form an estimate of what the power of nature can do,
   they fix on this passage. But Paul, as I have said already, does not
   here set before us simply the natural man, but in his own person
   describes what is the weakness of the faithful, and how great it is.
   Augustine was for a time involved in the common error; but after having
   more clearly examined the passage, he not only retracted what he had
   falsely taught, but in his first book to Boniface, he proves, by many
   strong reasons, that what is said cannot be applied to any but to the
   regenerate. And we shall now endeavor to make our readers clearly to
   see that such is the case.

   I know not. He means that he acknowledges not as his own the works
   which he did through the weakness of the flesh, for he hated them. And
   so Erasmus has not unsuitably given this rendering, "I approve not,"
   (non probo.) [222] We hence conclude, that the doctrine of the law is
   so consentaneous to right judgment, that the faithful repudiate the
   transgression of it as a thing wholly unreasonable. But as Paul seems
   to allow that he teaches otherwise than what the law prescribes, many
   interpreters have been led astray, and have thought that he had assumed
   the person of another; hence has arisen the common error, that the
   character of an unregenerate man is described throughout this portion
   of the chapter. But Paul, under the idea of transgressing the law,
   includes all the defects of the godly, which are not inconsistent with
   the fear of God or with the endeavor of acting uprightly. And he denies
   that he did what the law demanded, for this reason, because he did not
   perfectly fulfil it, but somewhat failed in his effort.

   For not what I desire, etc. You must not understand that it was always
   the case with him, that he could not do good; but what he complains of
   is only this -- that he could not perform what he wished, so that he
   pursued not what was good with that alacrity which was meet, because he
   was held in a manner bound, and that he also failed in what he wished
   to do, because he halted through the weakness of the flesh. Hence the
   pious mind performs not the good it desires to do, because it proceeds
   not with due activity, and doeth the evil which it would not; for while
   it desires to stand, it falls, or at least it staggers. But the
   expressions to will and not to will must be applied to the Spirit,
   which ought to hold the first place in all the faithful. The flesh
   indeed has also its own will, but Paul calls that the will which is the
   chief desire of the heart; and that which militates with it he
   represents as being contrary to his will.

   We may hence learn the truth of what we have stated -- that Paul speaks
   here of the faithful, [223] in whom the grace of the Spirit exists,
   which brings an agreement between the mind and the righteousness of the
   law; for no hatred of sin is to be found in the flesh.

   16. But if what I desire not, I do, I consent to the law, etc.; that
   is, "When my heart acquiesces in the law, and is delighted with its
   righteousness, (which certainly is the case when it hates the
   transgression of it,) it then perceives and acknowledges the goodness
   of the law, so that we are fully convinced, experience itself being our
   teacher, that no evil ought to be imputed to the law; nay, that it
   would be salutary to men, were it to meet with upright and pure
   hearts." But this consent is not to be understood to be the same with
   what we have heard exists in the ungodly, who have expressed words of
   this kind, "I see better things and approve of them; I follow the
   worse." Again, "What is hurtful I follow; I shun what I believe would
   be profitable." For these act under a constraint when they subscribe to
   the righteousness of God, as their will is wholly alienated from it,
   but the godly man consents to the law with the real and most cheerful
   desire of his heart; for he wishes nothing more than to mount up to
   heaven. [224]

   17. Now it is no more I who do it, etc. This is not the pleading of one
   excusing himself, as though he was blameless, as the case is with many
   triflers who think that they have a sufficient defense to cover all
   their wickedness, when they cast the blame on the flesh; but it is a
   declaration, by which he shows how very far he dissented from his own
   flesh in his spiritual feeling; for the faithful are carried along in
   their obedience to God with such fervour of spirit that they deny the
   flesh.

   This passage also clearly shows, that Paul speaks here of none but of
   the godly, who have been already born again; for as long as man remains
   like himself, whatsoever he may be, he is justly deemed corrupt; but
   Paul here denies that he is wholly possessed by sin; nay, he declares
   himself to be exempt from its bondage, as though he had said, that sin
   only dwelt in some part of his soul, while with an earnest feeling of
   heart he strove for and aspired after the righteousness of God, and
   clearly proved that he had the law of God engraven within him. [225]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [219] This is evidently the case here. As carnal means what is sinful
   and corrupt, so spiritual imports what is holy, just, and good. As the
   works of the flesh are evil and depraved works, so the fruits of the
   Spirit are good and holy fruits. See Galatians 5:19, 22, and
   particularly John 3:6. -- Ed.

   [220] "He is carnal' in exact proportion to the degree in which he
   falls short of perfect conformity to the law of God." -- Scott It has
   been usual with a certain class of divines, such as Hammond and Bull,
   to hold that all the Fathers before Augustine viewed Paul here as not
   speaking of himself. But this is plainly contradicted by what Augustine
   declares himself in several parts of his writings. In his
   Retractations, B. 1, chapter 23, he refers to some authors of divine
   discourses (quibusdam divinorum tractatoribus eloquiorom) by whose
   authority he was induced to change his opinion, and to regard Paul here
   as speaking of himself. He alludes again in his work against Julian, an
   advocate of Pelagianism, B. 6, chapter 11, to this very change in his
   view, and ascribes it to the reading of the works of those who were
   better and more intelligent than himself, (melioribus et
   intelligentioribus cessi.) Then he refers to them by name, and says,
   "Hence it was that I came to understand these things, as Hilary,
   Gregory, Ambrose, and other holy and known doctors of the Church,
   understood them, who thought that the Apostle himself strenuously
   struggled against carnal lusts, which he was unwilling to have, and yet
   had, and that he bore witness as to this confiict in these words,"
   (referring to this very text,) -- Hinc factum est. ut sic ista
   intelligerem, quemadmodum intellexit Hilarius, Gregorius, Ambroslus, et
   coeteri Ecclsioe sancti notique doctores, qui et ipsum Apostolum
   adversus carnales concupiscentias, quas habere nolebat, et tamen
   habebat, strenue conflixisse, eundemque conflictum suum illis suis
   verbis contestatum fuisse senserunt -- Ed.

   [221] It appears from this, that Calvin did not apply the foregoing
   words, "I am carnal, sold under sin," in the same way: but they are
   evidently connected together. They are indeed strong words, and some
   explain them in such a way as to be wholly unsuitable to a renewed man;
   but we ought to take the explanation as given by the Apostle himself in
   what follows, for he handles the subject to the end of the chapter.
   Various fictions have been resorted to by critics on this point. The
   Apostle has been supposed by some to speak of himself as under the law,
   or as Stuart terms it, "in a law state," and such is the scheme of
   Hammond Others have imagined, that he personates a Jew living during
   the time between Abraham and the giving of the law; and this was
   Locke's idea. A third party have entertained the notion, that the
   Apostle, speaking in his own person, represents, by a sort of fiction,
   as Vitringa and some others have imagined, the effects of the law in
   Jews and proselytes, as opposed to the effects of the gospel, as
   delineated in the next chapter. And a fourth party maintain, that the
   Apostle describes a man in a transition state, in whom God's Spirit
   works for his conversion, but who is as yet doubtful which way to turn,
   to sin or to God. All these conjectures have arisen, because the
   language is not taken in its obvious meaning, and according to the
   Apostle's own explanation. As soon as we depart from the plain meaning
   of the text and the context, we open a door to endless conjectures and
   fictions. The Apostle says nothing here of himself, but what every real
   Christian finds to be true. Is not a Christian, yea, the best, in this
   world carnal, as well as spiritual? Is he not "sold under sin?" that
   is, subjected to a condition, in which he is continually annoyed,
   tempted, hindered, restrained, checked, and seduced by the depravity
   and corruption of his nature; and in which he is always kept far below
   what he aims at, seeks and longs for. It was the saying of a good man,
   lately gone to his rest, whose extended pilgrimage was ninety-three
   years, that he must have been often swallowed up by despair, had it not
   been for the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. The best
   interpreter of many things in Scripture is spiritual experience;
   without it no right judgment can be formed. Hence it is that the
   learned often stumble at what is quite plain and obvious to the
   illiterate when spiritually enlightened. Critics sometimes find great
   difficulties in what is fully understood by a simpler minded Christian,
   taught from above. "Wayfaring men" are far better divines than any of
   the learned, who possess nothing more than natural talents and natural
   acquirements. -- Ed.

   [222] "Pii quod perpetrant non agnoscunt, non approbant, non excusant,
   non palliant;" -- "What the godly do [amiss,] they know not, approve
   not, excuse not, palliate not." -- Pareus The verb ginosko is used here
   in the sense of the Hebrew verb yd which is often so rendered by the
   Septuagint. See Psalm 1:6; Hosea 8:4; and Matthew 7:23. -- Ed.

   [223] "As the Apostle was far more enlightened and humble than
   Christians in general are, doubtless this clog (indwelling sin) was
   more uneasy to him than it is to them, though most of us find our lives
   at times greatly embittered by it. So that this energetic language,
   which many imagine to describe an unestablished believer's experience,
   or even that of an unconverted man, seems to have resulted from the
   extraordinary degree of St. Paul's sanctification, and the depth of his
   self-abasement and hatred of sin; and the reason of our not readily
   understanding him seems to be, because we are far beneath him in
   holiness, humility, acquaintance with the spirituality of God's law,
   and the evil of our own hearts, and in our degree of abhorrence of
   moral evil." -- Scott "What some mistake as the evidence of a spiritual
   decline on the part of the Apostle, was in fact the evidence of his
   growth. It is the effusion of a more quick and cultured sensibility
   than fell to the lot of ordinary men." -- Chalmers

   [224] "I consent -- consentio -- sumphemi, I say with, assent to, agree
   with, confirm." -- Ed.

   [225] The last clause of this verse is worthy of notice, as the
   expression "indwelling sin" seems to have arisen from the words he
   oikousa en emoi -- "which dwells in me." Sin was in him as in a house
   or dwelling; it was an in-habiting sin, or that which is in-abiding or
   resident. -- Ed.

   Romans 7:18-20

   18. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
   thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is
   good I find not.

   18. Novi enim quod non habitat [226] in me (hoc est, in came mea)
   bonum: siquidem velle adest mihi, sed ut perficiam bonum non reperio.

   19. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not,
   that I do.

   19. Non enim quod volo facio bonum; sed quod nolo malum, id ago.

   20. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
   that dwelleth in me.

   20. Si vero quod nolo ego id facio, non jam ego operor illud, sed quod
   habitat in me peccatum.

   18. For I know, etc. He says that no good by nature dwelt in him. Then
   in me, means the same as though he had said, "So far as it regards
   myself." In the first part he indeed arraigns himself as being wholly
   depraved, for he confesses that no good dwelt in him; and then he
   subjoins a modification, lest he should slight the grace of God which
   also dwelt in him, but was no part of his flesh. And here again he
   confirms the fact, that he did not speak of men in general, but of the
   faithful, who are divided into two parts -- the relics of the flesh,
   and grace. For why was the modification made, except some part was
   exempt from depravity, and therefore not flesh? Under the term flesh,
   he ever includes all that human nature is, everything in man, except
   the sanctification of the Spirit. In the same manner, by the term
   spirit, which is commonly opposed to the flesh, he means that part of
   the soul which the Spirit of God has so re-formed, and purified from
   corruption, that God's image shines forth in it. Then both terms, flesh
   as well as spirit, belong to the soul; but the latter to that part
   which is renewed, and the former to that which still retains its
   natural character. [227]

   To will is present, etc. He does not mean that he had nothing but an
   ineffectual desire, but his meaning is, that the work really done did
   not correspond to his will; for the flesh hindered him from doing
   perfectly what he did. So also understand what follows, The evil I
   desire not, that I do: for the flesh not only impedes the faithful, so
   that they can not run swiftly, but it sets also before them many
   obstacles at which they stumble. Hence they do not, because they
   accomplish not, what they would, with the alacrity that is meet. This,
   to will, then, which he mentions, is the readiness of faith, when the
   Holy Spirit so prepares the godly that they are ready and strive to
   render obedience to God; but as their ability is not equal to what they
   wish, Paul says, that he found not what he desired, even the
   accomplishment of the good he aimed at.

   19. The same view is to be taken of the expression which next follows,
   -- that he did not the good which he desired, but, on the contrary, the
   evil which he desired not: for the faithful, however rightly they may
   be influenced, are yet so conscious of their own infirmity, that they
   can deem no work proceeding from them as blameless. For as Paul does
   not here treat of some of the faults of the godly, but delineates in
   general the whole course of their life, we conclude that their best
   works are always stained with some blots of sin, so that no reward can
   be hoped, unless God pardons them.

   He at last repeats the sentiment, -- that, as far as he was endued with
   celestial light, he was a true witness and subscriber to the
   righteousness of the law. It hence follows, that had the pure integrity
   of our nature remained, the law would not have brought death on us, and
   that it is not adverse to the man who is endued with a sound and right
   mind and abhors sin. But to restore health is the work of our heavenly
   Physician.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [226] Non habitat bonum -- ouk oikei agathon. -- Ed.

   [227] The Apostle here is his own interpreter; he explains who the I is
   that does what the other I disapproved, and who the I is that hates
   what the other I does. He tells us here that it is not the same I,
   though announced at first as though it were the same. The one I, he
   informs us here, was his flesh, his innate sin or Corruption, and the
   other I, he tells us in Romans 7:22, was "the inner man," his new
   nature. The "inner man," as Calvin will tell us presently, is not the
   soul as distinguished from the body, but the renewed man as
   distinguished from the flesh. It is the same as the "new man" as
   distinguished from "the old man." See Ephesians 4:22, 24; Romans 6:6; 2
   Corinthians 5:17. But "the inward man," and "the outward man," in 2
   Corinthians 4:16, are the soul and the body; and "the inner man," in
   Ephesians 3:16, the same expression as in Romans 7:22, means the soul,
   as it is evident from the context. The same is meant by "the hidden man
   of the heart," in 1 Peter 3:4. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 7:21-23

   21. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with
   me.

   21. Reperio igitur Legem volenti mihi facere bonum quod mihi malum
   insideat. [228]

   22. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

   22. Consentio enim Legi Dei secundum interiorem hominem.

   23. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my
   mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
   members.

   23. Video autem alterum Legem in membris meis, repugnantem [229] legi
   mentis me����, et captivum me reddentem legi peccati, qu���� est in membris
   meis.

   21. I find then, etc. Here Paul supposes a fourfold law. The first is
   the law of God, which alone is properly so called, which is the rule of
   righteousness, by which our life is rightly formed. To this he joins
   the law of the mind, and by this he means the prompt readiness of the
   faithful mind to render obedience to the divine law, it being a certain
   conformity on our part with the law of God. On the other hand, he sets
   in opposition to this the law of unrighteousness; and according to a
   certain kind of similarity, he gives this name to that dominion which
   iniquity exercises over a man not yet regenerated, as well as over the
   flesh of a regenerated man; for the laws even of tyrants, however
   iniquitous they may be, are called laws, though not properly. To
   correspond with this law of sin he makes the law of the members, that
   is, the lust which is in the members, on account of the concord it has
   with iniquity.

   As to the first clause, many interpreters take the word law in its
   proper sense, and consider kata or dia to be understood; and so Erasmus
   renders it, "by the law;" as though Paul had said, that he, by the law
   of God as his teacher and guide, had found out that his sin was innate.
   But without supplying anything, the sentence would run better thus,
   "While the faithful strive after what is good, they find in themselves
   a certain law which exercises a tyrannical power; for a vicious
   propensity, adverse to and resisting the law of God, is implanted in
   their very marrow and bones."

   22. For I consent [230] to the law of God, etc. Here then you see what
   sort of division there is in pious souls, from which arises that
   contest between the spirit and the flesh, which Augustine in some place
   calls the Christian struggle (luctam Christianam.) The law calls man to
   the rule of righteousness; iniquity, which is, as it were, the
   tyrannical law of Satan, instigates him to wickedness: the Spirit leads
   him to render obedience to the divine law; the flesh draws him back to
   what is of an opposite character. Man, thus impelled by contrary
   desires, is now in a manner a twofold being; but as the Spirit ought to
   possess the sovereignty, he deems and judges himself to be especially
   on that side. Paul says, that he was bound a captive by his flesh for
   this reason, because as he was still tempted and incited by evil lusts;
   he deemed this a coercion with respect to the spiritual desire, which
   was wholly opposed to them. [231]

   But we ought to notice carefully the meaning of the inner man and of
   the members; which many have not rightly understood, and have therefore
   stumbled at this stone. The inner man then is not simply the soul, but
   that spiritual part which has been regenerated by God; and the members
   signify the other remaining part; for as the soul is the superior, and
   the body the inferior part of man, so the spirit is superior to the
   flesh. Then as the spirit takes the place of the soul in man, and the
   flesh, which is the corrupt and polluted soul, that of the body, the
   former has the name of the inner man, and the latter has the name of
   members. The inner man has indeed a different meaning in 2 Corinthians
   4:16; but the circumstances of this passage require the interpretation
   which I have given: and it is called the inner by way of excellency;
   for it possesses the heart and the secret feelings, while the desires
   of the flesh are vagrant, and are, as it were, on the outside of man.
   Doubtless it is the same thing as though one compared heaven to earth;
   for Paul by way of contempt designates whatever appears to be in man by
   the term members, that he might clearly show that the hidden renovation
   is concealed from and escapes our observation, except it be apprehended
   by faith.

   Now since the law of the mind undoubtedly means a principle rightly
   formed, it is evident that this passage is very absurdly applied to men
   not yet regenerated; for such, as Paul teaches us, are destitute of
   mind, inasmuch as their soul has become degenerated from reason.

   [228] "Insideat," -- parakeitai; the same verb in Romans 7:18, is
   rendered adest -- is present. It means, to lie near, to be at hand. --
   Ed.

   [229] "Repugnantem, -- antistrateuomenon, placing itself in battle
   array, fighting or warring against, taking the field or marching
   against an enemy. Then follows "taking" an enemy "captive,"
   aichmalotizonta. There are two sorts of captives, willing and
   unwilling. The latter is the case here; for the Apostle compares
   himself to captives of war, which are made so by force. The same is
   meant as by the expression, "sold under sin," verse 14, -- the
   constrained condition of being subject during life, to the annoyances,
   to the tempting, seducing, and deadening power of innate corruption. --
   Ed.

   [230] "Consentio," sunedomai: it is not the same verb as in Romans
   7:16; this signifies more than consent, for it includes gratification
   and delight. See Psalm 1:2. The verb is found only here. Macknight's
   version, "I am pleased with," is very feeble and inexpressive; Stuart's
   is better, "I take pleasure in;" but our common version is the best, "I
   delight in." The gar here would be better rendered "indeed:" the
   Apostle makes declaration as to his higher principle; and then in the
   next verse he states more fully what he had said in Romans 7:21. This
   exactly corresponds with his usual mode in treating subjects. He first
   states a thing generally, and afterwards more particularly, in more
   specific terms, and with something additional. -- Ed.

   [231] Some consider the conclusion of Romans 7:23, "to the law of sin
   which is in my members," as a paraphrase for "to itself;" as the
   Apostle describes it at the beginning as the law in his members: and
   the reason which may be assigned for the repetition is twofold, -- to
   preserve the distinction between it and "the law of the mind" in the
   preceding clause, -- and to give it a more distinctive character, by
   denominating it "the law of sin." We in fact find a gradation in the
   way in which it is set forth: in Romans 7:21, he calls it simply "a
   law;" in this verse he first calls it "another law in his members," and
   then, "the law of sin in his members." The construction of Romans 7:21,
   is difficult. Pareus quotes Chrysostom as supposing sumphenai from
   Romans 7:16, to be understood after "law," so as to give this
   rendering, "I find then that the law assents to me desiring to do
   good," etc., that is, that the law of God was on his side, "though evil
   was present with him." He then gives his own view, it being essentially
   that of Augustine: he supposes hoti kalos from Romans 7:16, to be
   understood after "law," and that hoti, in the last clause, is to be
   construed "though:" the verse is then to be rendered thus, -- "I find
   then the law, that it is good to me desiring to do good, though evil is
   present with me;" The verse taken by itself may thus present a good
   meaning, but not one that harmonizes with the context, or that forms a
   part of the Apostle's argument. The only other construction that
   deserves notice is that of our own version, and of Calvin, and it is
   that alone which corresponds with the context. It has been adopted by
   Beza, Grotius, Venema, Turrettin, Doddridge, and others. This verse,
   and the two which follow, conclude the subject, and also explain what
   he had been saying about willing and doing. He in fact accounts here
   for the paradoxical statements which he had made, by mentioning the
   operation and working of two laws, which were directly contrary to one
   another. It seems to be a mistake that he alludes to four laws; for the
   law of the mind and the law of God are the same, under different names;
   it is that of the mind, because it belongs to and resides in the mind:
   and it is the law of God, because it comes from him, and is implanted
   by his Spirit. To the other law he also gives two names, the "law in
   his members," and the "law of sin." This view is confirmed by the last
   verse in the chapter, which contains a summary of the whole. The latter
   part of Romans 7:23 is in character with the Hebraistic style, when the
   noun is stated instead of the pronoun; see Genesis 9:16; Psalm 50:23;
   and it is also agreeable to the same style to add the same sentiment
   with something more specific appended to it. This part then might be
   rendered thus, -- "and making me captive to itself, even to the law of
   sin, which is he my members." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 7:24-25

   24. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death?

   24. Miser ego homo! quis me eripiet a corpore mortis hoc?

   25. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I
   myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

   25. Gratias ago Deo per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum: itaque idem ego
   mente servio Legi Dei, carne autem legi peccati.

   24. Miserable, etc. He closes his argument with a vehement exclamation,
   by which he teaches us that we are not only to struggle with our flesh,
   but also with continual groaning to bewail within ourselves and before
   God our unhappy condition. But he asks not by whom he was to be
   delivered, as one in doubt, like unbelievers, who understand not that
   there is but one real deliverer: but it is the voice of one panting and
   almost fainting, because he does not find immediate help, [232] as he
   longs for. And he mentions the word rescue, [233] in order that he
   might show, that for his liberation no ordinary exercise of divine
   power was necessary.

   By the body of death he means the whole mass of sin, or those
   ingredients of which the whole man is composed; except that in him
   there remained only relics, by the captive bonds of which he was held.
   The pronoun toutou this, which I apply, as Erasmus does, to the body,
   may also be fitly referred to death, and almost in the same sense; for
   Paul meant to teach us, that the eyes of God's children are opened, so
   that through the law of God they wisely discern the corruption of their
   nature and the death which from it proceeds. But the word body means
   the same as the external man and members; for Paul points out this as
   the origin of evil, that man has departed from the law of his creation,
   and has become thus carnal and earthly. For though he still excels
   brute beasts, yet his true excellency has departed from him, and what
   remains in him is full of numberless corruptions so that his soul,
   being degenerated, may be justly said to have passed into a body. So
   God says by Moses,

   "No more shall my Spirit contend with man, for he is even flesh,"
   (Genesis 6:3:)

   thus stripping man of his spiritual excellency, he compares him, by way
   of reproach, to the brute creation. [234]

   This passage is indeed remarkably fitted for the purpose of beating
   down all the glory of the flesh; for Paul teaches us, that the most
   perfect, as long as they dwell in the flesh, are exposed to misery, for
   they are subject to death; nay, when they thoroughly examine
   themselves, they find in their own nature nothing but misery. And
   further, lest they should indulge their torpor, Paul, by his own
   example, stimulates them to anxious groanings, and bids them, as long
   as they sojourn on earth, to desire death, as the only true remedy to
   their evils; and this is the right object in desiring death. Despair
   does indeed drive the profane often to such a wish; but they strangely
   desire death, because they are weary of the present life, and not
   because they loathe their iniquity. But it must be added, that though
   the faithful level at the true mark, they are not yet carried away by
   an unbridled desire in wishing for death, but submit themselves to the
   will of God, to whom it behoves us both to live and to die: hence they
   clamor not with displeasure against God, but humbly deposit their
   anxieties in his bosom; for they do not so dwell on the thoughts of
   their misery, but that being mindful of grace received, they blend
   their grief with joy, as we find in what follows.

   25. I thank God; etc. He then immediately subjoined this thanksgiving,
   lest any should think that in his complaint he perversely murmured
   against God; for we know how easy even in legitimate grief is the
   transition to discontent and impatience. Though Paul then bewailed his
   lot, and sighed for his departure, he yet confesses that he acquiesced
   in the good pleasure of God; for it does not become the saints, while
   examining their own defects, to forget what they have already received
   from God. [235]

   But what is sufficient to bridle impatience and to cherish resignation,
   is the thought, that they have been received under the protection of
   God, that they may never perish, and that they have already been
   favored with the first-fruits of the Spirit, which make certain their
   hope of the eternal inheritance. Though they enjoy not as yet the
   promised glory of heaven, at the same time, being content with the
   measure which they have obtained, they are never without reasons for
   joy.

   So I myself, etc. A short epilogue, in which he teaches us, that the
   faithful never reach the goal of righteousness as long as they dwell in
   the flesh, but that they are running their course, until they put off
   the body. He again gives the name of mind, not to the rational part of
   the soul which philosophers extol, but to that which is illuminated by
   the Spirit of God, so that it understands and wills aright: for there
   is a mention made not of the understanding alone, but connected with it
   is the earnest desire of the heart. However, by the exception he makes,
   he confesses, that he was devoted to God in such a manner, that while
   creeping on the earth he was defiled with many corruptions. This is a
   suitable passage to disprove the most pernicious dogma of the Purists,
   (Catharorum,) which some turbulent spirits attempt to revive at the
   present day. [236]

   [232] Talaiporos, miser, ����rumnosus; "it denotes," says Schleusner, "one
   who is broken down and wearied with the most grievous toils." It is
   used by the Septuagint for the word sdvd, wasted, spoiled, desolated.
   See Psalm 137:8; Isaiah 33:1. -- Ed.

   [233] "Eripere" -- pluck out, rescue, take away by force; rhu'setai --

   [234] "This body of death" is an evident Hebraism, meaning "this deadly
   or mortiferous body;" which is not the material body, but the body of
   "the old man," Romans 7:6; called the "body of sin," when its character
   is described, and the "body of death," when the issue to which it leads
   is intended: it conducts to death, condemnation, and misery. -- Ed.

   [235] There is a different reading for the first clause of this verse,
   charis to Theo, "thanks to God," which, Griesbach says, is nearly equal
   to the received text; and there are a few copies which have he charis
   kuriou, "the grace of our Lord," etc.; which presents a direct answer
   to the foregoing question: but a considerable number more have he
   charis tou theou, "the grace of God," etc.; which also gives an answer
   to the preceding question. But the safest way, when there is no strong
   reason from the context, is to follow what is mostly sanctioned by MSS.
   Taking then the received text, we shall find a suitable answer to the
   foregoing question, if we consider the verb used in the question to be
   here understood, a thing not unusual; then the version would be, "I
   thank God, who will deliver me through Jesus Christ our Lord;" not as
   Macknight renders the verb, "who delivers me;" for the answer must be
   in the same tense with the question. -- Ed.

   [236] "Idem ego -- the same I," or, "I the same;" autos ego Beza
   renders it the same -- "idem ego," and makes this remark, "This was
   suitable to what follows, by which one man seems to have been divided
   into two." Others render it, "ipse ego -- I myself," and say that Paul
   used this dictlon emphatically, that none might suspect that he spoke
   in the person of another. See Romans 9:3; 2 Corinthians 10:1, 12, 13.
   The phrase imports this, "It is myself, and none else." He terms his
   innate sin "the flesh." By the flesh, says Pareus, "is not meant
   physically the muscular substance, but theologically the depravity of
   nature, -- not sensuality alone, but the unregenerated reason, will,
   and affections." -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 8
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 8:1-4

   1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
   Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. [237]

   1. Nulla igitur condemnatio est iis qui sunt in Christo Iesu, qui non
   secundum carnem ambulant, sed secundum Spiritum.

   2. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
   from the law of sin and death.

   2. Lex enim Spiritus vit���� in Christo Iesu, liberum me reddidit a lege
   peccati et mortis.

   3. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
   sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

   3. Quod enim impossibile erat Legi, eo quod infirmabatur per carnem,
   misso Deus Filio suo in similitudine carnis peccati, etiam de peccato
   damnavit peccatum in carne;

   4. That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
   not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

   4. Ut justificatio Legis impleretur in nobis qui non secumdum carnem
   ambulamus, sed secundum Spiritum.

   1. There is then, etc. After having described the contest which the
   godly have perpetually with their own flesh, he returns to the
   consolation, which was very needful for them, and which he had before
   mentioned; and it was this, -- That though they were still beset by
   sin, they were yet exempt from the power of death, and from every
   curse, provided they lived not in the flesh but in the Spirit: for he
   joins together these three things, -- the imperfection under which the
   faithful always labor, -- the mercy of God in pardoning and forgiving
   it, --and the regeneration of the Spirit; and this indeed in the last
   place, that no one should flatter himself with a vain notion, as though
   he were freed from the curse, while securely indulging in the meantime
   his own flesh. As then the carnal man flatters himself in vain, when in
   no way solicitous to reform his life, he promises to himself impunity
   under the pretense of having this grace; so the trembling consciences
   of the godly have an invincible fortress, for they know that while they
   abide in Christ they are beyond every danger of condemnation. We shall
   now examine the words.

   After the Spirit. Those who walk after the Spirit are not such as have
   wholly put off all the emotions of the flesh, so that their whole life
   is redolent with nothing but celestial perfection; but they are those
   who sedulously labor to subdue and mortify the flesh, so that the love
   of true religion seems to reign in them. He declares that such walk not
   after the flesh; for wherever the real fear of God is vigorous, it
   takes away from the flesh its sovereignty, though it does not abolish
   all its corruptions.

   2. For the law of the Spirit of life, etc. This is a confirmation of
   the former sentence; and that it may be understood, the meaning of the
   words must be noticed. Using a language not strictly correct, by the
   law of the Spirit he designates the Spirit of God, who sprinkles our
   souls with the blood of Christ, not only to cleanse us from the stain
   of sin with respect to its guilt, but also to sanctify us that we may
   be really purified. He adds that it is life-giving, (for the genitive
   case, after the manner of the Hebrew, is to be taken as an adjective,)
   it hence follows, that they who detain man in the letter of the law,
   expose him to death. On the other hand, he gives the name of the law of
   sin and death to the dominion of the flesh and to the tyranny of death,
   which thence follows: the law of God is set as it were in the middle,
   which by teaching righteousness cannot confer it, but on the contrary
   binds us with the strongest chains in bondage to sin and to death.

   The meaning then is, -- that the law of God condemns men, and that this
   happens, because as long as they remain under the bond of the law, they
   are oppressed with the bondage of sin, and are thus exposed to death;
   but that the Spirit of Christ, while it abolishes the law of sin in us
   by destroying the prevailing desires of the flesh, does at the same
   time deliver us from the peril of death. If any one objects and says,
   that then pardon, by which our transgressions are buried, depends on
   regeneration; to this it may be easily answered, that the reason is not
   here assigned by Paul, but that the manner only is specified, in which
   we are delivered from guilt; and Paul denies that we obtain deliverance
   by the external teaching of the law, but intimates that when we are
   renewed by the Spirit of God, we are at the same time justified by a
   gratuitous pardon, that the curse of sin may no longer abide on us. The
   sentence then has the same meaning, as though Paul had said, that the
   grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of
   righteousness.

   I dare not, with some, take the law of sin and death for the law of
   God, because it seems a harsh expression. For though by increasing sin
   it generates death, yet Paul before turned aside designedly from this
   invidious language. At the same time I no more agree in opinion with
   those who explain the law of sin as being the lust of the flesh, as
   though Paul had said, that he had become the conqueror of it. But it
   will appear very evident shortly, as I think, that he speaks of a
   gratuitous absolution, which brings to us tranquillizing peace with
   God. I prefer retaining the word law, rather than with Erasmus to
   render it right or power: for Paul did not without reason allude to the
   law of God. [238]

   3. For what was impossible for the law, etc. Now follows the polishing
   or the adorning of his proof, that the Lord has by his gratuitous mercy
   justified us in Christ; the very thing which it was impossible for the
   law to do. But as this is a very remarkable sentence, let us examine
   every part of it.

   That he treats here of free justification or of the pardon by which God
   reconciles us to himself, we may infer from the last clause, when he
   adds, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit
   For if Paul intended to teach us, that we are prepared by the spirit of
   regeneration to overcome sin, why was this addition made? But it was
   very proper for him, after having promised gratuitous remission to the
   faithful, to confine this doctrine to those who join penitence to
   faith, and turn not the mercy of God so as to promote the
   licentiousness of the flesh. And then the state of the case must be
   noticed; for the Apostle teaches us here how the grace of Christ
   absolves us from guilt.

   Now as to the expression, to adunaton, the impossibility of the law, it
   is no doubt to be taken for defect or impotency; as though it had been
   said, that a remedy had been found by God, by which that which was an
   impossibility to the law is removed. The particle, en ho, Erasmus has
   rendered "ea parte qua -- in that part in which;" but as I think it to
   be causal, I prefer rendering it, "eo quod -- because:" and though
   perhaps such a phrase does not occur among good authors in the Greek
   language, yet as the Apostles everywhere adopt Hebrew modes of
   expression, this interpretation ought not to be deemed improper. [239]
   No doubt intelligent readers will allow, that the cause of defect is
   what is here expressed, as we shall shortly prove again. Now though
   Erasmus supplies the principal verb, yet the text seems to me to flow
   better without it. The copulative kai, and, has led Erasmus astray, so
   as to insert the verb proestitit -- hath performed; but I think that it
   is used for the sake of emphasis; except it may be, that some will
   approve of the conjecture of a Grecian scholiast, who connects the
   clause thus with the preceding words, "God sent his own Son in the
   likeness of the flesh of sin and on account of sin," etc. I have
   however followed what I have thought to be the real meaning of Paul. I
   come now to the subject itself. [240]

   Paul clearly declares that our sins were expiated by the death of
   Christ, because it was impossible for the law to confer righteousness
   upon us. It hence follows, that more is required by the law than what
   we can perform; for if we were capable of fulfilling the law there
   would have been no need to seek a remedy elsewhere. It is therefore
   absurd to measure human strength by the precepts of the law; as though
   God in requiring what is justly due, had regarded what and how much we
   are able to do.

   Because it was weak etc. That no one might think that the law was
   irreverently charged with weakness, or confine it to ceremonies, Paul
   has distinctly expressed that this defect was not owing to any fault in
   the law, but to the corruption of our flesh; for it must be allowed
   that if any one really satisfies the divine law, he will be deemed just
   before God. He does not then deny that the law is sufficient to justify
   us as to doctrine, inasmuch as it contains a perfect rule of
   righteousness: but as our flesh does not attain that righteousness, the
   whole power of the law fails and vanishes away. Thus condemned is the
   error or rather the delirious notion of those who imagine that the
   power of justifying is only taken away from ceremonies; for Paul, by
   laying the blame expressly on us, clearly shows that he found no fault
   with the doctrine of the law.

   But further, understand the weakness of the law according to the sense
   in which the Apostle usually takes the word astheneia, weakness, not
   only as meaning a small imbecility but impotency; for he means that the
   law has no power whatever to justify. [241] You then see that we are
   wholly excluded from the righteousness of works, and must therefore
   flee to Christ for righteousness, for in us there can be none, and to
   know this is especially necessary; for we shall never be clothed with
   the righteousness of Christ except we first know assuredly that we have
   no righteousness of our own. The word flesh is to be taken still in the
   same sense, as meaning ourselves. The corruption then of our nature
   renders the law of God in this respect useless to us; for while it
   shows the way of life, it does not bring us back who are running
   headlong into death.

   God having sent his own Son, etc. He now points out the way in which
   our heavenly Father has restored righteousness to us by his Son, even
   by condemning sin in the very flesh of Christ; who by cancelling as it
   were the handwriting, abolished sin, which held us bound before God;
   for the condemnation of sin made us free and brought us righteousness,
   for sin being blotted out we are absolved, so that God counts us as
   just. But he declares first that Christ was sent, in order to remind us
   that righteousness by no means dwells in us, for it is to be sought
   from him, and that men in vain confide in their own merits, who become
   not just but at the pleasure of another, or who borrow righteousness
   from that expiation which Christ accomplished in his own flesh. But he
   says, that he came in the likeness of the flesh of sin; for though the
   flesh of Christ was polluted by no stains, yet it seemed apparently to
   be sinful, inasmuch as it sustained the punishment due to our sins, and
   doubtless death exercised all its power over it as though it was
   subject to itself. And as it behoved our High-priest to learn by his
   own experience how to aid the weak, Christ underwent our infirmities,
   that he might be more inclined to sympathy, and in this respect also
   there appeared some resemblance of a sinful nature.

   Even for sin, etc. I have already said that this is explained by some
   as the cause or the end for which God sent his own Son, that is, to
   give satisfaction for sin. Chrysostom and many after him understood it
   in a still harsher sense, even that sin was condemned for sin, and for
   this reason, because it assailed Christ unjustly and beyond what was
   right. I indeed allow that though he was just and innocent, he yet
   underwent punishment for sinners, and that the price of redemption was
   thus paid; but I cannot be brought to think that the word sin is put
   here in any other sense than that of an expiatory sacrifice, which is
   called 'sm, ashem, in Hebrew, [242] and so the Greeks call a sacrifice
   to which a curse is annexed katharma, catharma. The same thing is
   declared by Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:21, when he says, that

   "Christ, who knew no sin, was made sin for us, that we might become the
   righteousness of God in him."

   But the preposition peri peri, is to be taken here in a causative
   sense, as though he had said, "On account of that sacrifice, or through
   the burden of sin being laid on Christ, sin was cast down from its
   power, so that it does not hold us now subject to itself." For using a
   metaphor, he says that it was condemned, like those who fail in their
   cause; for God no longer deals with those as guilty who have obtained
   absolution through the sacrifice of Christ. If we say that the kingdom
   of sin, in which it held us, was demolished, the meaning would be the
   same. And thus what was ours Christ took as his own, that he might
   transfer his own to us; for he took our curse, and has freely granted
   us his blessing.

   Paul adds here, In the flesh, and for this end, -- that by seeing sin
   conquered and abolished in our very nature, our confidence might be
   more certain: for it thus follows, that our nature is really become a
   partaker of his victory; and this is what he presently declares.

   4. That the justification of the law might be fulfilled, etc. They who
   understand that the renewed, by the Spirit of Christ, fulfil the law,
   introduce a gloss wholly alien to the meaning of Paul; for the
   faithful, while they sojourn in this world, never make such a
   proficiency, as that the justification of the law becomes in them full
   or complete. This then must be applied to forgiveness; for when the
   obedience of Christ is accepted for us, the law is satisfied, so that
   we are counted just. For the perfection which the law demands was
   exhibited in our flesh, and for this reason -- that its rigor should no
   longer have the power to condemn us. But as Christ communicates his
   righteousness to none but to those whom he joins to himself by the bond
   of his Spirit, the work of renewal is again mentioned, lest Christ
   should be thought to be the minister of sin: for it is the inclination
   of many so to apply whatever is taught respecting the paternal kindness
   of God, as to encourage the lasciviousness of the flesh; and some
   malignantly slander this doctrine, as though it extinquished the desire
   to live uprightly. [243]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [237] This clause, "who walk not," etc., is regarded as spurious by
   Griesbach: a vast preponderance of authority as to MSS. is against it;
   and its proper place seems to be at the end of the fourth verse. It
   being placed here does not, however, interfere with the meaning. -- Ed.

   [238] Ca1vin has, in his exposition of this verse, followed Chrysostom,
   and the same view has been taken by Beza, Grotius, Vitringa, Doddridge,
   Scott, and Chalmers. But Pareus, following Ambrose, has taken another
   view, which Haldane has strongly advocated, and with considerable power
   of reasoning, though, as some may perhaps think, unsuccessfully. The
   exposition is this, -- "The law of the spirit of life" is the law of
   faith, or the gospel, which is the ministration of the Spirit; and "the
   spirit of life" means either the life-giving spirit, or the spirit
   which conveys the life which is in Christ Jesus. Then "the law of sin
   and death" is the moral law, so called because it discloses sin and
   denounces death. It is said that this view corresponds with the "no
   condemnation" in the first verse, and with the word "law" in the verse
   which follows, which is no doubt the moral law, and with the truth
   which the verse exhibits. It is also added that freedom or deliverance
   from the law of sin, viewed as the power of sin, is inconsistent with
   the latter part of the former chapter; and that the law of faith, which
   through the Spirit conveys life, makes us free from the moral law as
   the condition of life, is the uniform teaching of Paul. "This freedom,"
   says Pareus, "is ascribed to God, to Christ, and to the Gospel, -- to
   God as the author, Romans 7:25, -- to Christ as the mediator, -- and to
   the Gospel as the instrument: and the manner of this deliverance is
   more clearly explained in the verse which follows."

   [239] Calvin is not singular in this rendering. Pareus and Grotius give
   "quia vel quandoquidem -- because or since;" and the latter says, that
   en ho is an Hebraism for eph ho; see Romans 5:12 Beza refers to Mark
   2:19, and Luke 5:34, as instances where it means when or while, and
   says that it is used in Greek to designate not only a certain time, but
   also a certain state or condition. Piscator's rendering is "co quod --
   because." -- Ed.

   [240] The beginning of this verse, though the general import of it is
   evident, does yet present some difficulties as to its construction. The
   clause, as given by Calvin, is, "Quod enim impossibile erat legi," --
   to gar adunaton ton nomou Pareus supposes dia understood, "For on
   account of the impotency of the law," etc. Stuart agrees with Erasmus
   and Luther and supplies the verb "did," or accomplish, -- "For what the
   law could not accomplish,... God... accomplished," etc. But the simpler
   construction is, "For this," (that is, freedom from the power of sin
   and death, mentioned in the former verse,) "being impossible for the
   law," etc. It is instance of the nominative case absolute, which
   sometimes occurs in Hebrew. The possessive case, as Grotius says, has
   often the meaning of a dative after adjectives, as "malum hominis" is
   "malum homini -- evil to man." The to has sometimes the meaning of
   touto; it is separated by gar from the adjective. Some say that it is
   for hoti gar, "Because it was impossible for the law," etc. But changes
   of this kind are never satisfactory. The rendering of the whole verse
   may be made thus, -- 3. For this being impossible for the law, because
   it was weak through the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the
   likeness of sinful a flesh and on account of sin, has condemned sin in
   the flesh. God sent his Son in that flesh which was polluted by sin,
   though his Son's flesh, i.e. human nature, was sinless; and he sent him
   on account of that sin which reigned in human nature or flesh; and for
   this end -- to condemn, i.e., to doom to ruin, to adjudge to
   destruction, the sin which ruled in the flesh, i.e. in human nature as
   fallen and corrupted. This seems to be the meaning. Then in the
   following verse the design of this condemnation of sin is stated --
   that the righteousness of the law, or what the law requires, might be
   done by us. Without freedom from the power of sin, no service can be
   done to God. It is the destruction of the power of sin, and not the
   removal of guilt, that is contemplated here throughout; the text of the
   whole passage is walking after the flesh and walking after the Spirit.
   -- Ed.

   [241] The adjective to asthenes is applied to the commandment in
   Hebrews 7:18. "Impotent, inefficacious," are the terms used by Grotius;
   "destitute of strength," by Beza; and "weak," by Erasmus -- Ed.

   [242] The reference had better been made to cht't, a sin-offering, so
   called because cht', sin, was imputed to what was offered, and it was
   accepted as an atonement. See Leviticus 1:4; Leviticus 4:3, 4, 15;
   Leviticus 16:21. See also Exodus 30:10. The Septuagint adopted the same
   manner, and rendered sin-offering in many instances by hamartia, sin;
   and Paul has done the same in 2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 9:28. That
   "sin" should have two different meanings in the same verse or in the
   same clause, is what is perfectly consonant to the Apostle's manner of
   writing; he seems to delight in this kind of contrast in meaning while
   using the same words, depending on the context as to the explanation.
   He uses the word hope both in Romans 8:21, and in Romans 4:18, in this
   way. And this is not peculiar to Paul; it is what we observe in all
   parts of Scripture, both in the New and in the Old Testament. A
   striking instance of this, as to the word "life," psuche is found in
   Matthew 16:25, 26, in the last verse it is rendered improperly "soul."
   Fully admitting all this, I still think that "sin" here is to be taken
   in its common meaning, only personified. Beza connects peri hamartias
   with the preceding clause, "God having sent his own Son in the likeness
   of sinful flesh, and that for or on account of sin, (idque pro
   peccato,)" etc., that is, as he explains, for expiating or taking away
   sin. "A sin-offering" may indeed be its meaning, for the same
   expression is often used in this sense in the Septuagint. See Leviticus
   5:7, 9, 11; Psalm 40:6 The sense of taking away strength, or depriving
   of power or authority, or of destroying, or of abolishing, does not
   belong, says Schleusner, to the verb katakrinein, to condemn; he
   renders it here "punished -- punivit," that is, God adjudged to sin the
   punishment due to it. The meaning is made to be the same as when it is
   said, that God "laid on him the iniquities of us all." By taking a view
   of the whole passage, from Romans 7:24 to Romans 8:5, for the whole of
   this is connected, and by noticing the phraseology, we shall probably
   conclude that the power of sin and not its guilt is the subject treated
   of. "Law" here is used for a ruling power, for that which exercises
   authority and ensures obedience. "The law of sin," is the ruling power
   of sin; "the law of the spirit of life," is the power of the Spirit the
   author of life; "the law of death" is the power which death exercises.
   Then "walking after the flesh" is to live in subjection to the flesh;
   as "walking after the Spirit" is to live in subjection to him. All
   these things have a reference to the power and not to the guilt of sin.
   The same subject is continued from Romans 8:5 to Romans 8:15. -- Ed.

   [243] Commentators are divided as to the meaning of this verse. This
   and the second verse seem to bear a relation in sense to one another;
   so that if the second verse refers to justification, this also refers
   to it; but if freedom from the power of sin and death be what is taught
   in the former verse, the actual or personal fulfillment of the law must
   be what is intended here. Some, such as Pareus and Venema, consider
   justification to be the subject of both verses; and others, such as
   Scott and Doddridge, consider it to be sanctification. But Beza,
   Chalmers, as well as Calvin, somewhat inconsistently, regard the second
   verse as speaking of freedom from the power or dominion of sin, and not
   from its guilt or condemnation, and this verse as speaking of the
   imputed righteousness of Christ, and not of that righteousness which
   believers are enabled to perform by the Spirit's aid and influence. The
   verses seem so connected in the argument, that one of these two ideas
   must be held throughout. There is nothing decisive in the wording of
   this verse, though the cast of the expressions seem more favorable to
   the idea entertained by Doddridge and Scott, and especially what
   follows in the context, where the work of the Spirit is exclusively
   spoken of. The word dikaioma, is better rendered "righteousness" than
   "justification;" for "the righteousness to the law" means the
   righteousness which the law requires; and the words "might be fulfilled
   in us," may, with equal propriety as to the uses loquendi, be rendered,
   "might be performed by us." The verb pleroo has this meaning in Romans
   13:8, and in other places. Viewed in this light the verse contains the
   same truth with what is expressed by "serving the law of God," in
   Romans 7:25, and the same with yielding our members as "instruments of
   righteousness unto God," in Romans 6:13. That this is to establish a
   justification by the law, is obviated by the consideration, that this
   righteousness is performed through the efficacy of Christ's death, and
   through the reviving power of the Spirit, and not through the law, and
   that it is not a justifying righteousness before God, for it is
   imperfect, and the law can acknowledge nothing as righteousness but
   what is perfect. The sanctification now begun will be finally
   completed; but it is all through grace: and the completion of this work
   will be a complete conformity with the immutable law of God. -- Ed.

   Romans 8:5-8

   5. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
   but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

   5. Qui enim secundum carnem sunt, ea qu���� carnis sunt cogitant; qui vero
   secundum Spiritum, ea qu���� sunt Spiritus.

   6. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is
   life and peace.

   6. Cogitatio certe carnis, mors est; cogitatio autem Spiritus, vita et
   pax:

   7. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject
   to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

   7. Quandoquidem cogitatio carnis, inimicitia est adversus Deum; nam
   Legi Dei non subjicitur, nec enim potest.

   8. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

   8. Qui ergo in carne sunt, Deo placere non possunt.

   5. For they who are after the flesh, etc. He introduces this difference
   between the flesh and the Spirit, not only to confirm, by an argument
   derived from what is of an opposite character, what he has before
   mentioned, -- that the grace of Christ belongs to none but to those
   who, having been regenerated by the Spirit, strive after purity; but
   also to relieve the faithful with a seasonable consolation, lest being
   conscious of many infirmities, they should despair: for as he had
   exempted none from the curse, but those who lead a spiritual life, he
   might seem to cut off from all mortals the hope of salvation; for who
   in this world can be found adorned with so much angelic purity so as to
   be wholly freed from the flesh? It was therefore necessary to define
   what it is to be in the flesh, and to walk after the flesh. At first,
   indeed, Paul does not define the distinction so very precisely; but yet
   we shall see as we proceed, that his object is to afford good hope to
   the faithful, though they are bound to their flesh; only let them not
   give loose reins to its lusts, but give themselves up to be guided by
   the Holy Spirit.

   By saying that carnal men care for, or think upon, the things of the
   flesh, he shows that he did not count those as carnal who aspire after
   celestial righteousness, but those who wholly devote themselves to the
   world. I have rendered phronousin by a word of larger meaning, cogitant
   -- think, that readers may understand that those only are excluded from
   being the children of God who, being given to the allurements of the
   flesh, apply their minds and study to depraved lusts. [244] Now, in the
   second clause he encourages the faithful to entertain good hope,
   provided they find that they are raised up by the Spirit to the
   meditation of righteousness: for wherever the Spirit reigns, it is an
   evidence of the saving grace of God; as the grace of God does not exist
   where the Spirit being extinguished the reign of the flesh prevails.
   But I will briefly repeat here what I have reminded you of before, --
   That to be in the flesh, or, after the flesh, is the same thing as to
   be without the gift of regeneration: [245] and such are all they who
   continue, as they commonly say, in pure naturals, (Puris naturalibus.)

   6. The minding of the flesh, etc. Erasmus has rendered it "affection,"
   (affectum;) the old translator, "prudence," (prudentiam.) But as it is
   certain that the to phronema of Paul is the same with what Moses calls
   the imagination (figmentum -- devising) of the heart, (Genesis 6:5;)
   and that under this word are included all the faculties of the soul --
   reason, understanding, and affections, it seems to me that minding
   (cogitatio -- thinking, imagining, caring) is a more suitable word
   [246] And though Paul uses the particle gar -- for, yet I doubt not but
   that is only a simple confirmative, for there is here a kind of
   concession; for after having briefly defined what it is to be in the
   flesh, he now subjoins the end that awaits all who are slaves to the
   flesh. Thus by stating the contrary effect, he proves, that they cannot
   be partakers of the favor of Christ, who abide in the flesh, for
   through the whole course of their life they proceed and hasten unto
   death.

   This passage deserves special notice; for we hence learn, that we,
   while following the course of nature, rush headlong into death; for we,
   of ourselves, contrive nothing but what ends in ruin. But he
   immediately adds another clause, to teach us, that if anything in us
   tends to life, it is what the Spirit produces; for no spark of life
   proceeds from our flesh.

   The minding of the Spirit he calls life, for it is life-giving, or
   leads to life; and by peace he designates, after the manner of the
   Hebrews, every kind of happiness; for whatever the Spirit of God works
   in us tends to our felicity. There is, however, no reason why any one
   should on this account attribute salvation to works; for though God
   begins our salvation, and at length completes it by renewing us after
   his own image; yet the only cause is his good pleasure, whereby he
   makes us partakers of Christ.

   7. Because the minding of the flesh, [247] etc. He subjoins a proof of
   what he had stated, -- that nothing proceeds from the efforts of our
   flesh but death, because it contends as an enemy against the will of
   God. Now the will of God is the rule of righteousness; it hence
   follows, that whatever is unjust is contrary to it; and what is unjust
   at the same time brings death. But while God is adverse, and is
   offended, in vain does any one expect life; for his wrath must be
   necessarily followed by death, which is the avenging of his wrath. But
   let us observe here, that the will of man is in all things opposed to
   the divine will; for, as much as what is crooked differs from what is
   straight, so much must be the difference between us and God.

   For to the law of God, etc. This is an explanation of the former
   sentence; and it shows how all the thinkings (meditationes) of the
   flesh carry on war against the will of God; for his will cannot be
   assailed but where he has revealed it. In the law God shows what
   pleases him: hence they who wish really to find out how far they agree
   with God must test all their purposes and practices by this rule. For
   though nothing is done in this world, except by the secret governing
   providence of God; yet to say, under this pretext, that nothing is done
   but what he approves, (nihil nisi eo approbante fieri,) is intolerable
   blasphemy; and on this subject some fanatics are wrangling at this day.
   The law has set the difference between right and wrong plainly and
   distinctly before our eyes, and to seek it in a deep labyrinth, what
   sottishness is it! The Lord has indeed, as I have said, his hidden
   counsel, by which he regulates all things as he pleases; but as it is
   incomprehensible to us, let us know that we are to refrain from too
   curious an investigation of it. Let this in the mean time remain as a
   fixed principle, -- that nothing pleases him but righteousness, and
   also, that no right estimate can be made of our works but by the law,
   in which he has faithfully testified what he approves and disapproves.

   Nor can be. Behold the power of free-will! which the Sophists cannot
   carry high enough. Doubtless, Paul affirms here, in express words, what
   they openly detest, -- that it is impossible for us to render our
   powers subject to the law. They boast that the heart can turn to either
   side, provide it be aided by the influence of the Spirit, and that a
   free choice of good or evil is in our power, when the Spirit only
   brings help; but it is ours to choose or refuse. They also imagine some
   good emotions, by which we become of ourselves prepared. Paul, on the
   contrary, declares, that the heart is full of hardness and indomitable
   contumacy, so that it is never moved naturally to undertake the yoke of
   God; nor does he speak of this or of that faculty, but speaking
   indefinitely, he throws into one bundle all the emotions which arise
   within us. [248] Far, then, from a Christian heart be this heathen
   philosophy respecting the liberty of the will. Let every one
   acknowledge himself to be the servant of sin, as he is in reality, that
   he may be made free, being set at liberty by the grace of Christ: to
   glory in any other liberty is the highest folly.

   8. They then who are in the flesh, etc. It is not without reason that I
   have rendered the adversative de as an illative: for the Apostle infers
   from what had been said, that those who give themselves up to be guided
   by the lusts of the flesh, are all of them abominable before God; and
   he has thus far confirmed this truth, -- that all who walk not after
   the Spirit are alienated from Christ, for they are without any
   spiritual life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [244] The verb phroneo as Leigh justly says, includes the action of the
   mind, will, and affections, but mostly in Scripture it expresses the
   action of the will and affections. It means to understand, to desire,
   and to relish or delight in a thing. It is rendered here by Erasmus and
   Vatablus, "curant -- care for;" by Beza, Pareus, and the Vulgate,
   "sapiunt -- relish or savour;" by Doddridge and Macknight, "mind," as
   in our version; and by Stuart, "concern themselves with." It evidently
   means attention, regard, pursuit and delight, -- the act of the will
   and affections, rather than that of the mind. "The verb," says
   Turrettin, "means not only to think of, to understand, to attend to a
   thing; but also to mind it, to value it, and to take great delight in
   it. -- Ed.

   [245] Jerome says, that to be in the flesh is to be in a married state!
   How superstition perverts the mind! and then the perverted mind
   perverts the word of God. -- Ed.

   [246] It is difficult to find a word to express the idea here intended.
   It is evident that to phronema tos sarkos is the abstract of "minding
   the things of the flesh," in the preceding verse. The mindedness,
   rather than the minding of the flesh, would be most correct. But the
   phrase is no doubt Hebraistic, the adjective is put as a noun in the
   genitive case, so that its right version is, "The carnal mind;" and
   "mind" is to be taken in the wide sense of the verb, as including the
   whole soul, understanding, will, and affections. The phrase is thus
   given in the next verse in our version; and it is the most correct
   rendering. The mind of the flesh is its thoughts, desires, likings, and
   delight. This carnal mind is death, i.e., spiritual death now, leading
   to that which is eternal; or death, as being under condemnation, and
   producing wretchedness and misery; it is also enmity towards God,
   including in its very spirit hatred and antipathy to God. On the other
   hand, "the spiritual mind" is "life," i.e., a divine life, a living
   principle of holiness, accompanied with "peace," which is true
   happiness; or life by justification, and "peace" with God as the fruit
   of it. The word phronema is only found in one other place, in Romans
   8:27, -- "the mind," wish, or desire "of the Spirit." -- Ed.

   [247] The order which the Apostle observes ought to be noticed. He
   begins in Romans 8:5, or at the end of Romans 8:4, with two characters
   -- the carnal and, the spiritual. He takes the carnal first, because it
   is the first as to us in order of time. And here he does not reverse
   the order, as he sometimes does, when the case admits it, but goes on
   first with the carnal man, and then, in Romans 8:9 to 11, he describes
   the spiritual. -- Ed.

   [248] Stuart attempts to evade this conclusion, but rather in an odd
   way. The whole amount, as he seems to say, of what the Apostle
   declares, is that this phronema sarkos itself is not subject, and
   cannot be, to the law of God; but whether the sinner who cherishes it
   "is actuated by other principles and motives," the expression, he says,
   does not seem satisfactorily to determine. Hence he stigmatizes with
   the name of "metaphysical reasoning" the doctrine of man's moral
   inability, without divine grace, to turn to God -- a doctrine which
   Luther, Calvin, and our own Reformers equally maintained. The Apostle
   does not only speak abstractedly, but he applies what he advances to
   individuals, and concludes by saying, So then they that are in the
   flesh cannot please God." Who and what can bring them out of this
   state? The influence of "other principles and motives," or the grace of
   God? This is no metaphysical question, and the answer to it determines
   the point. Our other American brother, Barnes, seems also to deprecate
   this doctrine of moral inability, and makes distinctions to no purpose,
   attempting to separate the carnal mind from him in whom it exists, as
   though man could be in a neutral state, neither in the flesh nor in the
   Spirit. "It is an expression," as our third American brother, Hodge,
   justly observes, "applied to all unrenewed persons, as those who are
   not in the flesh are in the Spirit." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 8:9-11

   9. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
   Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
   Christ, he is none of his.

   9. Vos autem non estis in carne, sed in Spiritu, siquidem Spiritus Dei
   habitat in vobis: si quis vero Spiritum Christi non habet, hic non est
   ejus.

   10. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
   Spirit is life because of righteousness.

   10. Si vero Christus in vobis est, corpus quidem mortuum est propter
   peccatum, Spiritus autem vita est propter justitiam.

   11. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
   in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
   mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

   11. Si inquam Spiritus ejus qui suscitavit Iesum ex mortuis, habitat in
   vobis, qui suscitavit Christum ex mortuis, vivificabit et mortalia
   corpora propter Spiritum suum in vobis habitantem.

   9. But ye, etc. He applies hypothetically a general truth to those to
   whom he was writing; not only that by directing his discourse to them
   particularly he might more powerfully affect them, but also that they
   might with certainty gather from the description already given, that
   they were of the number of those, from whom Christ had taken away the
   curse of the law. Yet, at the same time, by explaining what the Spirit
   of God works in the elect, and what fruit he brings forth, he
   encourages them to strive after newness of life.

   If indeed the Spirit of God, etc. This qualifying sentence is fitly
   subjoined, by which they were stirred up to examine themselves more
   closely, lest they should profess the name of Christ in vain. And it is
   the surest mark by which the children of God are distinguished from the
   children of the world, when by the Spirit of God they are renewed unto
   purity and holiness. It seems at the same time to have been his
   purpose, not so much to detect hypocrisy, as to suggest reasons for
   glorying against the absurd zealots of the law, who esteem the dead
   letter of more importance than the inward power of the Spirit, who
   gives life to the law.

   But this passage shows, that what Paul has hitherto meant by the
   Spirit, is not the mind or understanding (which is called the superior
   part of the soul by the advocates of freewill) but a celestial gift;
   for he shows that those are spiritual, not such as obey reason through
   their own will, but such as God rules by his Spirit. Nor are they yet
   said to be according to the Spirit, because they are filled with God's
   Spirit, (which is now the case with none,) but because they have the
   Spirit dwelling in them, though they find some remains of the flesh
   still remaining in them: at the same time it cannot dwell in them
   without having the superiority; for it must be observed that man's
   state is known by the power that bears rule in him.

   But if any have not the Spirit of Christ, etc. He subjoins this to show
   how necessary in Christians is the denial of the flesh. The reign of
   the Spirit is the abolition of the flesh. Those in whom the Spirit
   reigns not, belong not to Christ; then they are not Christians who
   serve the flesh; for they who separate Christ from his own Spirit make
   him like a dead image or a carcase. And we must always bear in mind
   what the Apostle has intimated, that gratuitous remission of sins can
   never be separated from the Spirit of regeneration; for this would be
   as it were to rend Christ asunder.

   If this be true, it is strange that we are accused of arrogance by the
   adversaries of the gospel, because we dare to avow that the Spirit of
   Christ dwells in us: for we must either deny Christ, or confess that we
   become Christians through his Spirit. It is indeed dreadful to hear
   that men have so departed from the word of the Lord, that they not only
   vaunt that they are Christians without God's Spirit, but also ridicule
   the faith of others: but such is the philosophy of the Papists.

   But let readers observe here, that the Spirit is, without any
   distinction, called sometimes the Spirit of God the Father, and
   sometimes the Spirit of Christ; and thus called, not only because his
   whole fulness was poured on Christ as our Mediator and head, so that
   from him a portion might descend on each of us, but also because he is
   equally the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, who have one essence,
   and the same eternal divinity. As, however, we have no intercourse with
   God except through Christ, the Apostle wisely descends to Christ from
   the Father, who seems to be far off:

   10. But if Christ be in us, etc. What he had before said of the Spirit
   he says now of Christ, in order that the mode of Christ's dwelling in
   us might be intimated; for as by the Spirit he consecrates us as
   temples to himself, so by the same he dwells in us. But what we have
   before referred to, he now explains more fully -- that the children of
   God are counted spiritual, not on the ground of a full and complete
   perfection, but only on account of the newness of life that is begun in
   them. And he anticipates here an occasion of doubt, which might have
   otherwise disturbed us; for though the Spirit possesses a part of us,
   we yet see another part still under the power of death. He then gives
   this answer -- that the power of quickening is in the Spirit of Christ,
   which will be effectual in swallowing up our mortality. He hence
   concludes that we must patiently wait until the relics of sin be
   entirely abolished.

   Readers have been already reminded, that by the word Spirit they are
   not to understand the soul, but the Spirit of regeneration; and Paul
   calls the Spirit life, not only because he lives and reigns in us, but
   also because he quickens us by his power, until at length, having
   destroyed the mortal fesh, he perfectly renews us. So, on the other
   hand, the word body signifies that gross mass which is not yet purified
   by the Spirit of God from earthly dregs, which delight in nothing but
   what is gross; for it would be otherwise absurd to ascribe to the body
   the fault of sin: besides the soul is so far from being life that it
   does not of itself live. The meaning of Paul then is -- that although
   sin adjudges us to death as far as the corruption of our first nature
   remains in us, yet that the Spirit of God is its conqueror: nor is it
   any hindrance, that we are only favored with the first-fruits, for even
   one spark of the Spirit is the seed of life. [249]

   11. If the Spirit, etc. This is a confirmation of the last verse,
   derived from the efficient cause, and according to this sense, --
   "Since by the power of God's Spirit Christ was raised, and since the
   Spirit possesses eternal power, he will also exert the same with regard
   to us." And he takes it as granted, that in the person of Christ was
   exhibited a specimen of the power which belongs to the whole body of
   the Church: and as he makes God the author of the resurrection, he
   assigns to him a life-giving Spirit.

   Who raised, etc. By this periphrasis he describes God; which harmonizes
   better with his present object, than if he had called him simply by his
   own name. For the same reason he assigns to the Father the glory of
   raising Christ; for it more clearly proved what he had in view, than if
   he had ascribed the act to Christ himself. For it might have been
   objected, "That Christ was able by his own power to raise up himself,
   and this is what no man can do." But when he says, that God raised up
   Christ by his Spirit, and that he also communicated his Spirit to us,
   there is nothing that can be alleged to the contrary; so that he thus
   makes sure to us the hope of resurrection. Nor is there anything here
   that derogates from that declaration in John,

   "I have power to lay down my life, and to take it up again."
   (John 10:18.)

   No doubt Christ arose through his own power; but as he is wont to
   attribute to the Father whatever Divine power he possesses, so the
   Apostle has not improperly transferred to the Father what was
   especially done by Christ, as the peculiar work of divinity.

   By mortal bodies he understands all those things which still remain in
   us, that are subject to death; for his usual practice is to give this
   name to the grosser part of us. We hence conclude, that he speaks not
   of the last resurrection, which shall be in a moment, but of the
   continued working of the Spirit, by which he gradually mortifies the
   relics of the flesh and renews in us a celestial life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [249] There are mainly two explanations of this verse and the
   following, with some shades of difference. The one is given here;
   according to which "the body," and "bodies," are taken figuratively for
   nature corrupted by sin; the "body," as it is flesh, or corrupted, is
   "dead," is crucified, or doomed to die "on account of sin;" and this
   "body," or these "bodies," which are mortal, and especially so as to
   their corruption, are to be quickened, revived, and made subservient to
   the will of God. It appears that this is essentially the view taken by
   Chrysostom, and also by Erasmus, Locke, Marckius, and by Stuart and
   Barnes. It is said that nekron and thneta have the same meaning with
   "crucified" and "destroyed," in Romans 6:6, and "dead," in Romans 6:7,
   8, and "dead," in Romans 6:11, and "mortal," in Romans 6:12. And as to
   the meaning of zoopoiesei, is "shall quicken," reference is made to
   Colossians 2:12, 13; Ephesians 1:19, 20; Ephesians 2:5, 6. It is also
   added, that the words "mortify the deeds of the body," in Romans 8:13,
   confirm this view. The other explanation, adopted by Augustine, and
   also by Pareus, Vitringa, Turrettin, Doddridge, Scott, Chalmers,
   Haldane, and Hodge, is the following, -- The "body," and "bodies," are
   to be taken literally, and the spirit, in the 10th verse, is the
   renewed man, or the renewed soul, which has or possesses "life" through
   the righteousness of Christ, or is made to enjoy life through the
   righteousness implanted by the Spirit. The meaning then is this, "The
   body is dead through sin, is doomed to die because of sin; but the
   spirit is life through righteousness, the soul renewed has life through
   Christ's righteousness: but the dying body, now tabernacled by the
   Spirit, shall also be quickened and made immortal through the mighty
   power of the divine Spirit." Thus salvation shall be complete when the
   "redemption of the body" shall come. See Romans 8:23. While the two
   views are theologically correct, the latter is that which is the most
   consonant with the usual phraseology of Scripture, though the former
   seems the most suitable to the context. The subject evidently is the
   work of the Spirit in mortifying sin, and in bestowing and sustaining
   spiritual life. The inference in the next verse seems favorable to this
   view. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 8:12-14

   12. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
   after the flesh.

   12. Itaque fratres, debitores sumus, non carni, ut secundum carnem
   vivamus.

   13. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the
   Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

   13. Si enim secundum carnem vixeritis, moriemini: si vero Spiritu facta
   carnis [250] mortificaveritis, vivetis.

   14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
   God.

   14. Quicunque enim Spiritu Dei aguntur, ii filii Dei sunt.

   12. So then, brethren, etc. This is the conclusion of what has been
   previously said; for if we are to renounce the flesh, we ought not to
   consent to it; and if the Spirit ought to reign in us, it is
   inconsistent not to attend to his bidding. Paul's sentence is here
   defective, for he omits the other part of the contrast, -- that we are
   debtors to the Spirit; but the meaning is in no way obscure. [251] This
   conclusion has the force of an exhortation; for he is ever wont to draw
   exhortations from his doctrine. So in another place, Ephesians 4:30, he
   exhorts us

   "not to grieve the Spirit of God, by whom we have been sealed to the
   day of redemption:"

   he does the same in Galatians 5:25,

   "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."

   And this is the case, when we renounce carnal lusts, so as to devote
   ourselves, as those who are bound, to the righteousness of God. Thus
   indeed we ought to reason, not as some blasphemers are wont to do, who
   talk idly, and say, -- that we must do nothing, because we have no
   power. But it is as it were to fight against God, when we extinguish
   the grace offered to us, by contempt and negligence.

   13. For if ye will live after the flesh, etc. He adds a threatening, in
   order more effectually to shake off their torpor; by which also they
   are fully confuted who boast of justification by faith without the
   Spirit of Christ, though they are more than sufficiently convicted by
   their own conscience; for there is no confidence in God, where there is
   no love of righteousness. It is indeed true, that we are justified in
   Christ through the mercy of God alone; but it is equally true and
   certain, that all who are justified are called by the Lord, that they
   may live worthy of their vocation. Let then the faithful learn to
   embrace him, not only for justification, but also for sanctification,
   as he has been given to us for both these purposes, lest they rend him
   asunder by their mutilated faith.

   But if ye by the Spirit, etc. He thus moderates his address, that he
   might not deject the minds of the godly, who are still conscious of
   much infirmity; for however we may as yet be exposed to sins, he
   nevertheless promises life to us, provided we strive to mortify the
   flesh: for he does not strictly require the destruction of the flesh,
   but only bids us to make every exertion to subdue its lusts.

   14. For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, etc. This is a
   confirmation of what has immediately preceded; for he teaches us, that
   those only are deemed the sons of God who are ruled by his Spirit; for
   by this mark God acknowledges them as his own people. Thus the empty
   boasting of hypocrites is taken away, who without any reason assume the
   title; and the faithful are thus encouraged with unhesitating
   confidence to expect salvation. The import of the whole is this -- "all
   those are the sons of God who are led [252] by God's Spirit; all the
   sons of God are heirs of eternal life: then all who are led by God's
   Spirit ought to feel assured of eternal life. But the middle term or
   assumption is omitted, for it was indubitable.

   But it is right to observe, that the working of the Spirit is various:
   for there is that which is universal, by which all creatures are
   sustained and preserved; there is that also which is peculiar to men,
   and varying in its character: but what he means here is sanctification,
   with which the Lord favors none but his own elect, and by which he
   separates them for sons to himself.

   [250] "Deeds of the body" is our version, and the preponderance of
   authority, according to Griesbach, is in its favor, though he admits
   that the other reading, te sarko, is nearly equal to it, and deserves
   farther inquiry. -- Ed.

   [251] He did not mention the other part, says Pareus, "because it was
   so evident." Besides, what he had already stated, and what he proceeds
   to state, are so many evidences of our obligations to live after the
   Spirit, that it was unnecessary to make such an addition. -- Ed.

   [252] Agontai -- are led or conducted: "A metaphor taken from the blind

   So we have need to be led by the Spirit in the way of truth, for we are
   blind and see no light. Or it is a metaphor taken from infants, who can
   hardly walk without a guide; for the regenerated are like little
   children lately born. Thus we are reminded of our misery and weakness;
   and we ought not to ascribe to ourselves either knowledge or strength
   apart from the Spirit of God." -- Pareus
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 8:15-18

   15. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
   ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

   15. Et enim non accepistis spiritum servitutis iterum in terrorem: sed
   accepistis Spiritum adoptionis, per quem clamamus, Abba, Pater.

   16. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
   children of God:

   16. Ipse enim Spiritus simul testificatur spiritui nostro quod sumus
   filii Dei:

   17. And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
   together.

   17. Si vero filii, etiam h����redes; h����redes quidem Dei, coh����redes autem
   Christi: siquidem compatimur, ut et una glorificemur.

   18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
   worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

   18. Existimo certe non esse pares afflictiones hujus temporis ad
   futuram gloriam qu���� revelabitur erga nos.

   15. He now confirms the certainty of that confidence, in which he has
   already bidden the faithful to rest secure; and he does this by
   mentioning the special effect produced by the Spirit; for he has not
   been given for the purpose of harassing us with trembling or of
   tormenting us with anxiety; but on the contrary, for this end -- that
   having calmed every perturbation, and restoring our minds to a tranquil
   state, he may stir us up to call on God with confidence and freedom. He
   does not then pursue only the argument which he had before stated, but
   dwells more on another clause, which he had connected with it, even the
   paternal mercy of God, by which he forgives his people the infirmities
   of the flesh and the sins which still remain in them. He teaches us
   that our confidence in this respect is made certain by the Spirit of
   adoption, who could not inspire us with confidence in prayer without
   sealing to us a gratuitous pardon: and that he might make this more
   evident, he mentions a twofold spirit; he calls one the spirit of
   bondage, which we receive from the law; and the other, the spirit of
   adoption, which proceeds from the gospel. The first, he says, was given
   formerly to produce fear; the other is given now to afford assurance.
   By such a comparison of contrary things the certainty of our salvation,
   which he intended to confirm, is, as you see, made more evident. [253]
   The same comparison is used by the author of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, where he says, that we have not come to Mount Sinai, where all
   things were so terrible, that the people, being alarmed as it were by
   an immediate apprehension of death, implored that the word should be no
   more spoken to them, and Moses himself confessed that he was terrified;

   "but to Sion, the mount of the Lord, and to his city, the heavenly
   Jerusalem, where Jesus is, the Mediator of the New Testament," etc.
   (Hebrews 12:22,24.)

   By the adverb again, we learn, that the law is here compared with the
   gospel: for the Son of God by his coming has brought to us this
   invaluable benefit, -- that we are no longer bound by the servile
   condition of the law. You are not however to infer from this, either
   that no one before the coming of Christ was endued with the spirit of
   adoption, or that all who received the law were servants and not sons:
   for he compares the ministration of the law with the dispensation of
   the gospel rather than persons with persons. I indeed allow that the
   faithful are here reminded how much more bountifully God now deals with
   them than he did formerly with the fathers under the Old Testament; he
   yet regards the outward dispensation, in respect of which only we excel
   them: for though the faith of Abraham, of Moses, and of David, was
   superior to ours, yet as God kept them apparently under a schoolmaster,
   they had not advanced into that liberty which has been revealed to us.

   But it must at the same time be noticed, that it was designedly, on
   account of false apostles, that a contrast was made between the literal
   disciples of the law, and the faithful whom Christ, the heavenly
   Teacher, not only addresses by words, but also teaches inwardly and
   effectually by his Spirit.

   And though the covenant of grace is included under the law, it is yet
   far different from it; for in setting up the gospel in opposition to
   it, he regards nothing but what was peculiar to the law itself, as it
   commands and forbids, and restrains transgressors by the denunciation
   of death: and thus he gives the law its own character, in which it
   differs from the gospel; or this statement may be preferred by some, --
   "He sets forth the law only, as that by which God covenants with us on
   the ground of works." So then persons only must be regarded as to the
   Jewish people; for when the law was published, and also after it was
   published, the godly were illuminated by the same Spirit of faith; and
   thus the hope of eternal life, of which the Spirit is the earnest and
   seal, was sealed on their hearts. The only difference is, that the
   Spirit is more largely and abundantly poured forth in the kingdom of
   Christ. But if you regard only the dispensation of the law, it will
   then appear, that salvation was first clearly revealed at that time,
   when Christ was manifested in the flesh. All things under the Old
   Testament were involved in great obscurity, when compared with the
   clear light of the gospel.

   And then, if the law be viewed in itself, it can do nothing but
   restrain those, devoted to its miserable bondage, by the horror of
   death; for it promises no good except under condition, and denounces
   death on all transgressors. Hence, as there is the spirit of bondage
   under the law, which oppresses the conscience with fear; so under the
   gospel there is the spirit of adoption, which exhilarates our souls by
   bearing a testimony as to our salvation. But observe, that fear is
   connected with bondage, as it cannot be otherwise, but that the law
   will harass and torment souls with miserable disquietness, as long as
   it exercises its dominion. There is then no other remedy for quieting
   them, except God forgives us our sin and deals kindly with us as a
   father with his children.

   Through whom we cry, etc. He has changed the person, that he might
   describe the common privilege of all the saints; as though he had said,
   -- "Ye have the spirit, through whom you and all we, the rest of the
   faithful, cry," etc. The imitation of their language is very
   significant; when he introduces the word Father, in the person of the
   faithful. The repetition of the name is for the sake of amplification;
   for Paul intimates, that God's mercy was so published through the whole
   world, that he was invoked, as Augustine observes, indiscriminately in
   all languages. [254] His object then was to express the consent which
   existed among all nations. It hence follows, that there is now no
   difference between the Jew and the Greek, as they are united together.
   Isaiah speaks differently when he declares, that the language of Canaan
   would be common to all, (Isaiah 19:18;) yet the meaning is the same;
   for he had no respect to the external idiom, but to the harmony of
   heart in serving God, and to the same undisguised zeal in professing
   his true and pure worship. The word cry is set down for the purpose of
   expressing confidence; as though he said, "We pray not doubtingly, but
   we confidently raise up a loud voice to heaven."

   The faithful also under the law did indeed call God their Father, but
   not with such full confidence, as the vail kept them at a distance from
   the sanctuary: but now, since an entrance has been opened to us by the
   blood of Christ, we may rejoice fully and openly that we are the
   children of God; hence arises this crying. In short, thus is fulfilled
   the prophecy of Hosea,

   "I will say to them, My people are ye: they in their turn will answer,
   Thou art our God." (Hosea 2:23.)

   For the more evident the promise is, the greater the freedom in prayer.

   16. The Spirit himself, etc. He does not simply say, that God's Spirit
   is a witness to our spirit, but he adopts a compound verb, which might
   be rendered "contest," (contestatur,) were it not that contestation
   (contestatio) has a different meaning in Latin. But Paul means, that
   the Spirit of God gives us such a testimony, that when he is our guide
   and teacher, our spirit is made assured of the adoption of God: for our
   mind of its own self, without the preceding testimony of the Spirit,
   could not convey to us this assurance. There is also here an
   explanation of the former verse; for when the Spirit testifies to us,
   that we are the children of God, he at the same time pours into our
   hearts such confidence, that we venture to call God our Father. And
   doubtless, since the confidence of the heart alone opens our mouth,
   except the Spirit testifies to our heart respecting the paternal love
   of God, our tongues would be dumb, so that they could utter no prayers.
   For we must ever hold fast this principle, -- that we do not rightly
   pray to God, unless we are surely persuaded in our hearts, that he is
   our Father, when we so call him with our lips. To this there is a
   corresponding part, -- that our faith has no true evidence, except we
   call upon God. It is not then without reason that Paul, bringing us to
   this test, shows that it then only appears how truly any one believes,
   when they who have embraced the promise of grace, exercise themselves
   in prayers. [255]

   But there is here a striking refutation of the vain notions of the
   Sophists respecting moral conjecture, which is nothing else but
   uncertainty and anxiety of mind; nay, rather vacillation and delusion.
   [256] There is also an answer given here to their objection, for they
   ask, "How can a man fully know the will of God?" This certainly is not
   within the reach of man, but it is the testimony of God's Spirit; and
   this subject he treats more at large in the First Epistle to the
   Corinthians, from which we may derive a fuller explanation of a
   passage. Let this truth then stand sure, -- that no one can be called a
   son of God, who does not know himself to be such; and this is called
   knowledge by John, in order to set forth its certainty. (1 John 5:19,
   20.)

   17. And if children, etc. By an argument, taken from what is annexed or
   what follows, he proves that our salvation consists in having God as
   our Father. It is for children that inheritance is appointed: since God
   then has adopted us as his children, he has at the same time ordained
   an inheritance for us. He then intimates what sort of inheritance it is
   -- that it is heavenly, and therefore incorruptible and eternal, such
   as Christ possesses; and his possession of it takes away all
   uncertainty: and it is a commendation of the exellency of this
   inheritance, that we shall partake of it in common with the
   only-begotten Son of God. It is however the design of Paul, as it will
   presently appear more fully, highly to extol this inheritance promised
   to us, that we may be contented with it, and manfully despise the
   allurements of the world, and patiently bear whatever troubles may
   press on us in this life.

   If so be that we suffer together, etc. Various are the interpretations
   of this passage, but I approve of the following in preference to any
   other, "We are co-heirs with Christ, provided, in entering on our
   inheritance, we follow him in the same way in which he has gone
   before." And he thus made mention of Christ, because he designed to
   pass over by these steps to an encouraging strain, -- "God's
   inheritance is ours, because we have by his grace been adopted as his
   children; and that it may not be doubtful, its possession as been
   already conferred on Christ, whose partners we are become: but Christ
   came to it by the cross; then we must come to it in the same manner."
   [257] Nor is that to be dreaded which some fear, that Paul thus
   ascribes the cause of our eternal glory to our labours; for this mode
   of speaking is not unusual in Scripture. He denotes the order, which
   the Lord follows in dispensing salvation to us, rather than the cause;
   for he has already sufficiently defended the gratuitous mercy of God
   against the merits of works. When now exhorting us to patience, he does
   not show whence salvation proceeds, but how God governs his people.

   18. I indeed judge, [258] etc. Though they take not altogether an
   unsuitable view who understand this as a kind of modification; yet I
   prefer to regard it in the light of an encouragement, for the purpose
   of anticipating an objection, according to this import, -- "It ought
   not indeed to be grievous to us, if we must pass through various
   afflictions into celestial glory, since these, when compared with the
   greatness of that glory, are of the least moment." He has mentioned
   future for eternal glory, intimating that the afflictions of the world
   are such as pass away quickly.

   It is hence evident how ill understood has this passage been by the
   Schoolmen; for they have drawn from it their frivolous distinction
   between congruity and condignity. The Apostle indeed compares not the
   worthiness of the one with that of the other, but only lightens the
   heaviness of the cross by a comparison with the greatness of glory, in
   order to confirm the minds of the faithful in patience.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [253] By the Spirit, pneuma, (without the article,) some, as Augustine,
   Beza, and others, understand the Holy Spirit, and so Calvin, for the
   most part, seems to do. Then "the Spirit of bondage" means the Spirit
   the effect of whose administration was bondage; and "the Spirit of
   adoption" must signify the Spirit, the bestower of adoption. But we may
   take spirit here, in both instances, as it is often taken, in the sense
   of disposition or feeling; according to the expression, "the spirit of
   meekness" -- pneumati praotetos, 1 Corinthians 4:21, and "the spirit of
   fear" -- pneuma deilias 2 Timothy 1:7. The word for adoption,
   huiothesia, may be rendered sonship, or affiliation, or filiation, as
   Luther sometimes renders it: and as the Spirit of meekness means a meek
   spirit, so we may translate the two clauses here, "a servile spirit"
   and "a filial spirit." At the same time it may be better to take the
   "spirit" throughout as the divine Spirit, as in several instances it
   must evidently be so taken. -- Ed.

   [254] Wolfius gives a quotation from the Talmud, by which it appears
   that "servants" or slaves, and "maids" or bondmaids, were not allowed
   among the Jews to call their master Abba ('v'), nor their mistress Aima
   ('ym'), these being names which children alone were permitted to use.
   And Selden says, that there is an evident allusion in this passage to
   that custom among the Jews. Under the law the people of God were
   servants, but under the gospel they are made children; and hence the
   privilege of calling God Abba. Haldane, quoting Claude, gives the same
   explanation. The repetition of the word is for the sake of emphasis,
   and is given as an expression of warm, ardent, and intense feeling..
   See an example of this in our Savior's prayer in the garden, Mark
   14:36, and in what he said on the cross, Matthew 27:46. The idea
   mentioned by Calvin, derived from the Fathers, seems not to be well
   founded. -- Ed.

   [255] The words auto to pneuma, seem to mean the divine Spirit. The
   reference is to "the Spirit of God" in Romans 8:14; "This self-same
   Spirit," or, "He the Spirit," for so auto to pneuma, may be rendered,
   especially when the article intervenes between it and its noun. See
   Luke 24:15; John 16:27 Beza renders summarturei to pneumati hemon,
   "testifies together with our spirit -- una cum nostro spiritu," and the
   Vulqate "testifies to our spirit," as though the verb had not its
   compound; and it is said to have only the simpler meaning of
   testifying, though compounded, in Romans 9:1; and in Revelation 22:18,
   where it has a dative case after it as here, "I testify to every man,"
   etc. The soul appears to be here called "spirit," because the renewed
   soul is intended, or the soul having the spirit of adoption; or it may
   be an instance of the Apostle's mode of writing, who often puts the
   same word twice in a sentence, but in a different meaning. The Holy
   Spirit testifies to our spirit, say Origen and Theodoret, by producing
   obedience, love, and imitation of God, which are evidences of our
   adoption; but Chrysostom and Ambrose say, by enabling us to cry Abba,
   Father, according to to former verse. The latter seems to be the
   meaning adopted by Calvin It is said by Estius, according to Poole,
   that the compound verb is never used without the idea of a
   joint-testimony being implied, and that in Revelation 22:18, it is a
   testimony in conjunction with Christ. Then the import of this text
   would be, that the Holy Spirit testifies, together with the spirit of
   adoption, to our spirit, to our soul or renewed mind, that we are the
   children of God. Thus a direct influence of the Spirit, in addition to
   that which is sanctifying and filial, seems to have been intended. See
   2 Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 1:13,14, 1 John 2:20, 27 Professor Hodge
   gives this paraphrase, -- "Not only does our filial spirit towards God
   prove that we are his children, but the Holy Spirit itself conveys to
   our souls the assurance of this delightful fact." This seems to be the
   full and precise import of the passage. -- Ed.

   [256] "The [Roman] Catholic Church, with which all sects that proceed
   from Pelagian principles agree, deters from the certainty of the state
   of grace, and desires uncertainty towards God. Such uncertainty of
   hearts is then a convenient means to keep men in the leading-strings of
   the priesthood or ambitious founders of sects; for since they are not
   allowed to have any certainty themselves respecting their relation to
   God, they can only rest upon the judgments of their leaders about it,
   who thus rule souls with absolute dominion; the true evangelic doctrine
   makes free from such slavery to man. -- Olshausen There is no doubt
   much truth in these remarks; but another reason may be added: Those who
   know not themselves what assurance is, cannot consistently teach the
   doctrine; and real, genuine assurance, is an elevated state, to which
   man, attached to merely natural principles, can never ascend. -- Ed.

   [257] The particle eiper is rendered the same as here by Ambrose and
   Beza, "si modo -- if in case that;" but by Chrysostom and Peter Martyr,
   in the sense of epeidan, "quandoquidem -- since," "since we suffer
   together, in order that we may also be together glorified." The Vulgate
   has, "si tamen -- if however." It may be suitably rendered "provided."
   -- Ed.

   [258] The particle gar cannot be causal here. It has its primary
   meaning truly, indeed, or verily, though it has commonly its secondary
   meaning for, because, therefore. The context is our guide; when there
   is nothing previously said, for which a reason is given, then it has
   only an affirmative sense: or as some think, it is to be viewed as a
   particle of transition, or as signifying an addition, and may be
   rendered besides, further, moreover, perhaps this latter meaning would
   be suitable here. In the preceded verse the Apostle says, for the
   encouragement of Christians, that their conformity to Christ in
   suffering would terminate in conformity to him in glory: and then, as
   an additional consideration, he states his full conviction, that
   present sufferings are as nothing to the glory which they would have to
   enjoy. The connection can hardly be otherwise seen, except indeed we
   consider something understood, as, "Not only so;" and then it may be
   rendered for, as giving a reason for the qualifying negative. An
   ellipsis of this kind is not without examples in Greek authors, as well
   as in the New Testament. -- Ed.

   Romans 8:19-22

   19. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
   manifestation of the sons of God.

   19. Siquidem intenta expectatio creaturae, revelationem filiorum Dei
   expectat:

   20. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
   reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

   20. Vanitati enim creatura subjecta est non volens, sed propter eum qui
   subjecit ipsam in spe;

   21. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
   bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

   21. Quoniam ipsa quoque creatura asseretur a servitute corruptionis in
   libertatem glori���� filiorum Dei.

   22. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
   together until now.

   22. Novimus enim quod creatura universa congemiscit, et ad hunc diem
   parturit.

   19 For the intent expectation of the creation, etc. He teaches us that
   there is an example of the patience, to which he had exhorted us, even
   in mute creatures. For, to omit various interpretations, I understand
   the passage to have this meaning -- that there is no element and no
   part of the world which, being touched, as it were, with a sense of its
   present misery, does not intensely hope for a resurrection. He indeed
   lays down two things, -- that all are creatures in distress, -- and yet
   that they are sustained by hope. And it hence also appears how immense
   is the value of eternal glory, that it can excite and draw all things
   to desire it.

   Further, the expression, expectation expects, or waits for, though
   somewhat unusual, yet has a most suitable meaning; for he meant to
   intimate, that all creatures, seized with great anxiety and held in
   suspense with great desire, look for that day which shall openly
   exhibit the glory of the children of God. The revelation of God's
   children shall be, when we shall be like God, according to what John
   says,

   "For though we know that we are now his sons, yet it appears not yet
   what we shall be." (1 John 3:2.)

   But I have retained the words of Paul; for bolder than what is meet is
   the version of Erasmus, "Until the sons of God shall be manifest;" nor
   does it sufficiently express the meaning of the Apostle; for he means
   not, that the sons of God shall be manifested in the last day, but that
   it shall be then made known how desirable and blessed their condition
   will be, when they shall put off corruption and put on celestial glory.
   But he ascribes hope to creatures void of reason for this end, -- that
   the faithful may open their eyes to behold the invisible life, though
   as yet it lies hid under a mean garb.

   20. For to vanity has the creation, etc. He shows the object of
   expectation from what is of an opposite character; for as creatures,
   being now subject to corruption, cannot be restored until the sons of
   God shall be wholly restore; hence they, longing for their renewal,
   look forward to the manifestation of the celestial kingdom. He says,
   that they have been subjected to vanity, and for this reason, because
   they abide not in a constant and durable state, but being as it were
   evanescent and unstable, they pass away swiftly; for no doubt he sets
   vanity in opposition to a perfect state.

   Not willingly, etc. Since there is no reason in such creatures, their
   will is to be taken no doubt for their natural inclination, according
   to which the whole nature of things tends to its own preservation and
   perfection: whatever then is detained under corruption suffers
   violence, nature being unwilling and repugnant. But he introduces all
   parts of the world, by a sort of personification, as being endued with
   reason; and he does this in order to shame our stupidity, when the
   uncertain fluctuation of this world, which we see, does not raise our
   minds to higher things.

   But on account of him, etc. He sets before us an example of obedience
   in all created things, and adds, that it springs from hope; for hence
   comes the alacrity of the sun and moon, and of all the stars in their
   constant courses, hence is the sedulity of the earth's obedience in
   bringing forth fruits, hence is the unwearied motion of the air, hence
   is the prompt tendency to flow in water. God has given to everything
   its charge; and he has not only by a distinct order commanded what he
   would to be done, but also implanted inwardly the hope of renovation.
   For in the sad disorder which followed the fall of Adam, the whole
   machinery of the world would have instantly become deranged, and all
   its parts would have failed had not some hidden strength supported
   them. It would have been then wholly inconsistent that the earnest of
   the Spirit should be less efficacious in the children of God than
   hidden instinct in the lifeless parts of creation. How much soever then
   created things do naturally incline another way; yet as it has pleased
   God to bring them under vanity, they obey his order; and as he has
   given them a hope of a better condition, with this they sustain
   themselves, deferring their desire, until the incorruption promised to
   them shall be revealed. He now, by a kind of personification, ascribes
   hope to them, as he did will before.

   21. Because the creation itself, etc. He shows how the creation has in
   hope been made subject to vanity; that is, inasmuch as it shall some
   time be made free, according to what Isaiah testifies, and what Peter
   confirms still more clearly. It is then indeed meet for us to consider
   what a dreadful curse we have deserved, since all created things in
   themselves blameless, both on earth and in the visible heaven, undergo
   punishment for our sins; for it has not happened through their own
   fault, that they are liable to corruption. Thus the condemnation of
   mankind is imprinted on the heavens, and on the earth, and on all
   creatures. It hence also appears to what excelling glory the sons of
   God shall be exalted; for all creatures shall be renewed in order to
   amplify it, and to render it illustrious.

   But he means not that all creatures shall be partakers of the same
   glory with the sons of God; but that they, according to their nature,
   shall be participators of a better condition; for God will restore to a
   perfect state the world, now fallen, together with mankind. But what
   that perfection will be, as to beasts as well as plants and metals, it
   is not meet nor right in us to inquire more curiously; for the chief
   effect of corruption is decay. Some subtle men, but hardly
   sober-minded, inquire whether all kinds of animals will be immortal;
   but if reins be given to speculations where will they at length lead
   us? Let us then be content with this simple doctrine, -- that such will
   be the constitution and the complete order of things, that nothing will
   be deformed or fading.

   22. For we know, etc. He repeats the same sentiment, that he might pass
   over to us, though what is now said has the effect and the form of a
   conclusion; for as creatures are subject to corruption, not through
   their natural desire, but through the appointment of God, and then, as
   they have a hope of being hereafter freed from corruption, it hence
   follows, that they groan like a woman in travail until they shall be
   delivered. But it is a most suitable similitude; it shows that the
   groaning of which he speaks will not be in vain and without effect; for
   it will at length bring forth a joyful and blessed fruit. The meaning
   is, that creatures are not content in their present state, and yet that
   they are not so distressed that they pine away without a prospect of a
   remedy, but that they are as it were in travail; for a restoration to a
   better state awaits them. By saying that they groan together, he does
   not mean that they are united together by mutual anxiety, but he joins
   them as companions to us. The particle hitherto, or, to this day,
   serves to alleviate the weariness of daily languor; for if creatures
   have continued for so many ages in their groaning, how inexcusable will
   our softness or sloth be if we faint during the short course of a
   shadowy life. [259]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [259] The various opinions which have been given on these verses are
   referred to at some length by Stuart; and he enumerates not less than
   eleven, but considers only two as entitled to special attention -- the
   material creation, animate and inanimate, as held here by Calvin, and
   the rational creation, including mankind, with the exception of
   Christians, which he himself maintains. In favor of the first he names
   Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, OEcumenius, Jerome, Ambrose,
   Luther, Koppe, Doddridge, (this is not correct,) Flatt, and Tholuck; to
   whom may be added Scott, Haldane, and Chalmers, though Scott, rather
   inconsistently with the words of the text, if the material creation
   including animals be meant, regards as a reverie their resurrection;
   see Romans 8:21. After a minute discussion of various points, Stuart
   avows his preference to the opinion, that the creature" means mankind
   in general, as being the least liable to objections; and he mentions as
   its advocates Lightfoot, Locke, Turrettin, Semler, Rosenm����ller, and
   others. He might have added Augustine. Reference is made for the
   meaning of the word "creature" to Mark 16:15; Colossians 1:23; and 1
   Peter 2:13. It appears from Wolfius, that the greater part of the
   Lutheran and Reformed Divines have entertained the first opinion, that
   the "creature" means the world, rational and animal; to which he
   himself mainly accedes; and what he considers next to this, as the most
   tenable, is the notion, that the "creature" means the faithful, that
   "the sons of God" are the blessed in heaven, and that the Apostles and
   apostolic men were those who enjoyed "the first-fruits of the Spirit."
   This last opinion relieves us from difficulties which press on all
   other expositions; and it may be extricated from objections which have
   been made to it; only the last sentence needs not be introduced. The
   whole passage, from Romans 8:18 to the end of Romans 8:25, is in
   character with the usual style of the Apostle. He finishes the first
   part with Romans 8:22; and then in the second part he announces the
   same thing in a different form, in more explicit terms, and with some
   additions. The "waiting" in Romans 8:19, has a correspondent "waiting"
   in Romans 8:23; and "the hope" in Romans 8:20, has another "hope" to
   correspond with it in Romans 8:24; and correspondent too is "the
   manifestation of the sons of God" in verse 19, and "the redemption of
   our body" in Romans 8:23. To reiterate the same truth in a different
   way was to make a deeper impression, and accordant with the Apostles
   manner of writing. He begins the second time, after Romans 8:22, in
   which is stated the condition of the whole world; and it is in contrast
   with that alone that Romans 8:23 is to be viewed, which restates and
   explains what had been previously said, so that "the creature" are the
   "we ourselves;" and the Apostle proceeds with the subject to end of the
   25th verse. Instances of the same sort of arrangement are to be found
   in Romans 2:17-24; Romans 11:33-36. Romans 8:21 may be considered as an
   explanation only of the "hope," at the end of Romans 8:20; "For even
   it, the creature," though subjected to vanity, "shall be delivered from
   the bondage of corruption;" which means the same as "this body of
   death," in Romans 7:24. The word ktisis, means, 1. creation, the world,
   Mark 10:6; Mark 13:19; Romans 1:20; 2 Peter 3:4: -- 2, what is created
   -- creature, what is formed -- a building, what is instituted -- an
   ordinance, Romans 1:25; 8:39; Hebrews 4:13; Hebrews 9:11; 1 Peter 2:13:
   -- 3, mankind, the world of men, Mark 16:15; Colossians 1:23: -- 4, the
   renewed man, or renewed nature -- Christians, 2 Corinthians 5:17;
   Galatians 6:15. There are only two other places where it is found, and
   is rendered in our version "creation," Colossians 1:15, and Revelation
   3:14 It is objected to its application here to Christians, because
   where it has this meaning, it is preceded by kaine, new. The same
   objection stands against applying it to mankind in general, for in
   these instances push precedes it. Its meaning must be gathered from the
   whole passage, and we must not stop at the end of verse 23, but include
   the two following verses. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 8:23-25

   23. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits
   of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for
   the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

   23. Non solum autem, sed ipsi quoque qui primordia Spiritus habemus;
   nos inquam ipsi in nobis ipsis gemimus, adoptionem expectantes,
   redemptionem corporis nostri.

   24. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
   what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

   24. Spe enim salvi facti sumus, spes vero qu���� conspicitur, non est
   spes; quod enim conspicit quis, quomodo etiam speret?

   25. But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait
   for it

   25. Si ergo non quod non conspicimus, speramus, per patientiam
   expectamus.

   23. And not only so, etc. There are those who think that the Apostle
   intended here to exalt the dignity of our future blessedness, and by
   this proof, because all things look for it with ardent desire; not only
   the irrational parts of creation, but we also who have been regenerated
   by the Spirit of God. This view is indeed capable of being defended,
   but there seems to me to be a comparison here between the greater and
   the less; as though he said, "The excellency of our glory is of such
   importance even to the very elements, which are destitute of mind and
   reason, that they burn with a certain kind of desire for it; how much
   more it behoves us, who have been illuminated by the Spirit of God, to
   aspire and strive with firmness of hope and with ardour of desire,
   after the attainment of so great a benefit." And he requires that there
   should be a feeling of two kinds in the faithful: that being burdened
   with the sense of their present misery, they are to groan; and that
   notwithstanding they are to wait patiently for their deliverance; for
   he would have them to be raised up with the expectation of their future
   blessedness, and by an elevation of mind to overcome all their present
   miseries, while they consider not what they are now, but what they are
   to be.

   Who have the beginnings, etc. Some render the word first-fruits,
   (primitias,) and as meaning a rare and uncommon excellency; but of this
   view I by no means approve. To avoid, therefore, any ambiguity, I have
   rendered the word beginnings, (primordia, the elements,) for I do not
   apply the expression, as they do, to the Apostles only, but to all the
   faithful who in this world are besprinkled only with a few drops by the
   Spirit; and indeed when they make the greatest proficiency, being
   endued with a considerable measure of it, they are still far off from
   perfection. These, then, in the view of the Apostle, are beginnings or
   first-fruits, to which is opposed the complete ingathering; for as we
   are not yet endued with fullness, it is no wonder that we feel
   disquietude. By repeating ourselves and adding in ourselves, he renders
   the sentence more emphatical, and expresses a more ardent desire, nor
   does he call it only a desire, but groaning: for in groaning there is a
   deep feeling of misery.

   Waiting for the adoption, etc. Improperly indeed, but not without the
   best reason, is adoption employed here to designate the fruition of the
   inheritance to which we are adopted; for Paul means this, that the
   eternal decree of God, by which he has chosen us to himself as sons
   before the foundation of the world, of which he testifies to us in the
   gospel, the assurance of which he seals on our hearts by his Spirit,
   would be void, except the promised resurrection were certain, which is
   its consummation. [260] For to what end is God our Father, except he
   receives us after we have finished our earthly pilgrimage into his
   celestial inheritance? To the same purpose is what he immediately
   subjoins, the redemption of the body. For the price of our redemption
   was in such a way paid by Christ, that death should notwithstanding
   hold us tied by its chains, yea, that we should carry it within us; it
   hence follows, that the sacrifice of the death of Christ would be in
   vain and fruitless, except its fruit appeared in our heavenly
   renovation.

   24. For by hope, etc. Paul strengthens his exhortation by another
   argument; for our salvation cannot be separated from some kind of
   death, and this he proves by the nature of hope. Since hope extends to
   things not yet obtained, and represents to our minds the form of things
   hidden and far remote, whatever is either openly seen or really
   possessed, is not an object of hope. But Paul takes it as granted, and
   what cannot be denied, that as long as we are in the world, salvation
   is what is hoped for; it hence follows, that it is laid up with God far
   beyond what we can see. By saying, that hope is not what is seen, he
   uses a concise expression, but the meaning is not obscure; for he means
   simply to teach us, that since hope regards some future and not present
   good, it can never be connected with what we have in possession. If
   then it be grievous to any to groan, they necessarily subvert the order
   laid down by God, who does not call his people to victory before he
   exercises them in the warfare of patience. But since it has pleased God
   to lay up our salvation, as it were, in his closed bosom, it is
   expedient for us to toil on earth, to be oppressed, to mourn, to be
   afflicted, yea, to lie down as half-dead and to be like the dead; for
   they who seek a visible salvation reject it, as they renounce hope
   which has been appointed by God as its guardian. [261]

   25. If then what we see not, etc. This is an argument derived from what
   the antecedent implies; for patience necessarily follows hope. For when
   it is grievous to be without the good you may desire, unless you
   sustain and comfort yourselves with patience, you must necessarily
   faint through despair. Hope then ever draws patience with it. Thus it
   is a most apt conclusion -- that whatever the gospel promises
   respecting the glory of the resurrection, vanishes away, except we
   spend our present life in patiently bearing the cross and tribulations.
   For if life be invisible, we must have death before our eyes: if glory
   be invisible, then our present state is that of degradation. And hence
   if you wish to include in a few words the meaning of the whole passage,
   arrange Paul's arguments in this way, "To all the godly there is
   salvation laid up in hope; it is the character of hope to look forward
   to future and absent benefits: then the salvation of the faithful is
   not visible. Now hope is not otherwise sustained than by patience; then
   the salvation of the faithful is not to be consummated except by
   patience."

   It may be added, that we have here a remarkable passage, which shows,
   that patience is an inseparable companion of faith; and the reason of
   this is evident, for when we console ourselves with the hope of a
   better condition, the feeling of our present miseries is softened and
   mitigated, so that they are borne with less difficulty. [262]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [260] The impropriety, which Calvin notices, is according to the usual
   phraseology of Scripture. What commences in this world and is completed
   in the next is called by the same name. The word salvation is used in
   this way as designating its commencement and its progress as well as
   its completion. Besides, adoption here has a particular regard to the
   body, as it is explained by the words which follow -- Ed.

   [261] When we are said to be saved by hope, the meaning is that we are
   not fully or perfectly saved now, and that this is what we hope for.
   "Eternal salvation," says Grotius, "we have not yet, but we hope for
   it." There is present salvation, but that which is perfect is future.
   The Scripture speaks of salvation now, see Ephesians 2:8; Titus 3:4, 5;
   and of salvation as future, see Mark 13:13; John 10:9. -- Ed.

   [262] "Patience," says Pareus, "is needful for three reasons, -- the
   good expected is absent, -- there is delay, -- and many difficulties
   intervene." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 8:26-27

   26. Likewise [263] the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
   not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

   26. Similiter vero Spiritus etiam coopitulatur infirmitatibus nostris;
   non enim quid oraturi sumus quemadmodum oportet, novimus; verum
   Spiritus ipse intercedit pro nobis gemitibus innarrabilibus.

   27. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
   Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the
   will of God.

   27. Qui vero scrutatur corda, novit cogitationem Spiritus, quod
   secundum Deum intercedit pro sanctis.

   26. And likewise the Spirit, etc. That the faithful may not make this
   objection -- that they are so weak as not to be able to bear so many
   and so heavy burdens, he brings before them the aid of the Spirit,
   which is abundantly sufficient to overcome all difficulties. There is
   then no reason for any one to complain, that the bearing of the cross
   is beyond their own strength, since we are sustained by a celestial
   power. And there is great force in the Greek word sunantilambanetai,
   which means that the Spirit takes on himself a part of the burden, by
   which our weakness is oppressed; so that he not only helps and succours
   us, but lifts us up; as though he went under the burden with us. [264]
   The word infirmities, being in the plural number, is expressive of
   extremity. For as experience shows, that except we are supported by
   God's hands, we are soon overwhelmed by innumerable evils, Paul reminds
   us, that though we are in every respect weak, and various infirmities
   threaten our fall, there is yet sufficient protection in God's Spirit
   to preserve us from falling, and to keep us from being overwhelmed by
   any mass of evils. At the same time these supplies of the Spirt more
   clearly prove to us, that it is by God's appointment that we strive, by
   groanings and sighings, for our redemption.

   For what we should pray for, etc. He had before spoken of the testimony
   of the Spirit, by which we know that God is our Father, and on which
   relying, we dare to call on him as our Father. He now again refers to
   the second part, invocation, and says, that we are taught by the same
   Spirit how to pray, and what to ask in our prayers. And appropriately
   has he annexed prayers to the anxious desires of the faithful; for God
   does not afflict them with miseries, that they may inwardly feed on
   hidden grief, but that they may disburden themselves by prayer, and
   thus exercise their faith.

   At the same time I know, that there are various expositions of this
   passage; [265] but Paul seems to me to have simply meant this, -- That
   we are blind in our addresses to God; for though we feel our evils, yet
   our minds are more disturbed and confused than that they can rightly
   choose what is meet and expedient. If any one makes this objection --
   that a rule is prescribed to us in God's word; to this I answer, that
   our thoughts nevertheless continue oppressed with darkness, until the
   Spirit guides them by his light.

   But the Spirit himself intercedes, [266] etc. Though really or by the
   event it does not appear that our prayers have been heard by God, yet
   Paul concludes, that the presence of the celestial favor does already
   shine forth in the desire for prayer; for no one can of himself give
   birth to devout and godly aspirations. The unbelieving do indeed blab
   out their prayers, but they only trifle with God; for there is in them
   nothing sincere, or serious, or rightly formed. Hence the manner of
   praying aright must be suggested by the Spirit: and he calls those
   groanings unutterable, into which we break forth by the impulse of the
   Spirit, for this reason -- because they far exceed the capability of
   our own minds. [267] And the Spirit is said to intercede, not because
   he really humbles himself to pray or to groan, but because he stirs up
   in our hearts those desires which we ought to entertain; and he also
   affects our hearts in such a way that these desires by their fervency
   penetrate into heaven itself. And Paul has thus spoken, that he might
   more significantly ascribe the whole to the grace of the Spirit. We are
   indeed bidden to knock; but no one can of himself premeditate even one
   syllable, except God by the secret impulse of his Spirit knocks at our
   door, and thus opens for himself our hearts.

   27. But he who searches hearts, etc. This is a remarkable reason for
   strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray
   through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the
   thoughts of his own Spirit. And here must be noticed the suitableness
   of the word to know; for it intimates that God regards not these
   emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as
   unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly
   accepts them, as allowed and approved by him. As then Paul had before
   testified, that God then aids us when he draws us as it were into his
   own bosom, so now he adds another consolation, that our prayers, of
   which he is the director, shall by no means be disappointed. The reason
   also is immediately added, because he thus conforms us to his own will.
   It hence follows, that in vain can never be what is agreeable to his
   will, by which all things are ruled. Let us also hence learn, that what
   holds the first place in prayer is consent with the will of the Lord,
   whom our wishes do by no means hold under obligation. If then we would
   have our prayers to be acceptable to God, we must pray that he may
   regulate them according to his will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [263] The connection here is not very evident Osautos -- "similiter --
   in like manner," by Calvin; "itidem -- likewise," by Pareus and Beza;
   "pr����terea -- besides," by Grotius; "moreover," by Doddridge The word
   usually means, in the same, or, the like manner: but the two last seem
   to render it suitably to this place; for what follows is mentioned in
   addition to what had been stated respecting hope and patience. -- Ed.

   [264] Pareus says, that this verb is taken metaphorically from
   assistance afforded to infants not able to support themselves, or to
   the sick, tottering and hardly able to walk. "Coopitulatur" is Calvin's
   Latin -- co-assist," Beza's "una sublevat -- lifts up together," that
   is, together with those who labor under infirmities. The Vulgate has
   "adjuvat -- helps," like our version. Schleusner says, that it means to
   succor those whose strength is unequal to carry their burden alone. It
   is found in one other place, Luke 10:40. It is given by the Septuagint
   in Psalm 89:21, for 'mph -- "to strengthen, to invigorate," and in
   Exodus 18:22, for ns' 'tk -- "to bear with," that is, "a burden with
   thee," -- the very idea that it seems to have here -- Ed.

   [265] The opinions of Chrysostom, Ambrose, and Origen, are given by
   Pareus; and they are all different, and not much to the purpose. The
   view which Augustine gives is materially what is stated here. He gives
   a causative sense to the verb in the next clause, "Interpellare nos
   facit -- he causes us to ask." -- Ed.

   [266] "Intercedit -- huperentunchanei -- abundantly intercedes," for so
   huper, prefixed to verbs, is commonly rendered. This is the proper
   action of an advocate, a name given to the Spirit by our Savior, allon
   parakleton -- "another advocate," not "comforter," as in our version,
   and Christ is called by the same name in 1 John 2:1, and the same work,
   "interceding," is ascribed to him, Hebrews 7:25. But we learn in John
   14:16, that the Spirit is an advocate with us -- "that he may abide
   with you for ever;" and in 1 John 2:1, that Christ is an advocate in
   heaven -- "with the Father." The same name and a similar kind of work
   are ascribed to both. Some, as Doddridge, to avoid blending the offices
   of the two, have rendered the verb here by a different term, but not
   wisely. -- Ed.

   [267] Or, "the comprehension of our mind -- ingenii nostri captum."
   Schleusner says, that the word alaetos, has been improperly rendered
   ineffable or unutterable, and that the word to express such an idea is
   aneklaletos, (1 Peter 1:8,) and that from the analogy of the Greek
   language it must mean, "what is not uttered or spoken by the mouth;"
   and he gives akineton, "what is not moved," as an instance Bos and
   Grotius give the same meaning, "sine voce -- without voice;" and the
   latter says, that this was expressly said, because the Jews entertained
   a notion that there could be no prayer except it was expressed by the
   lips. It is however considered by most to have the meaning given here,
   "inutterable," or ineffable or inexpressible. -- Ed.

   Romans 8:28-30

   28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that
   love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

   28. Novimus autem quod iis qui diligunt Deum omnia cooperantur in
   bonum, iis scilicet qui secundum propositum vocati sunt sancti.

   29. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed
   to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
   brethren.

   29. Quoniam quos pr����cognovit etiam pr����finivit conformes imaginis Filii
   sui, ut sit ipse primogenitus inter multos fratres:

   30. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
   called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
   glorified.

   30. Quos vero pr����finivit, eos et vocavit; et quos vocavit, eos etiam
   justificavit; et quos justificavit, eos etiam glorificavit.

   28. And we know, etc. He now draws this conclusion from what had been
   said, that so far are the troubles of this life from hindering our
   salvation, that, on the contrary, they are helps to it. It is no
   objection that he sets down an illative particle, for it is no new
   thing with him to make somewhat an indiscriminate use of adverbs, and
   yet this conclusion includes what anticipates an objection. For the
   judgment of the flesh in this case exclaims, that it by no means
   appears that God hears our prayers, since our afflictions continue the
   same. Hence the Apostle anticipates this and says, that though God does
   not immediately succour his people, he yet does not forsake them, for
   by a wonderful contrivance he turns those things which seem to be evils
   in such a way as to promote their salvation. If any one prefers to read
   this verse by itself, as though Paul proceeded to a new argument in
   order to show that adversities which assist our salvation, ought not to
   be borne as hard and grievous things, I do not object. At the same
   time, the design of Paul is not doubtful: "Though the elect and the
   reprobate are indiscriminately exposed to similar evils, there is yet a
   great, difference; for God trains up the faithful by afflictions, and
   thereby promotes their salvation."

   But we must remember that Paul speaks here only of adversities, as
   though he had said, "All things which happen to the saints are so
   overruled by God, that what the world regards as evil, the issue shows
   to be good." For though what Augustine says is true, that even the sins
   of the saints are, through the guiding providence of God, so far from
   doing harm to them, that, on the contrary, they serve to advance their
   salvation; yet this belongs not to this passage, the subject of which
   is the cross.

   It must also be observed, that he includes the whole of true religion
   in the love of God, as on it depends the whole practice of
   righteousness.

   Even to them who according to his purpose, etc. This clause seems to
   have been added as a modification, lest any one should think that the
   faithful, because they love God, obtain by their own merit the
   advantage of deriving such fruit from their adversities. We indeed know
   that when salvation is the subject, men are disposed to begin with
   themselves, and to imagine certain preparations by which they would
   anticipate the favor of God. Hence Paul teaches us, that those whom he
   had spoken of as loving God, had been previously chosen by him. For it
   is certain that the order is thus pointed out, that we may know that it
   proceeds from the gratuitous adoption of God, as from the first cause,
   that all things happen to the saints for their salvation. Nay, Paul
   shows that the faithful do not love God before they are called by him,
   as in another place he reminds us that the Galatians were known of God
   before they knew him. (Galatians 4:9.) It is indeed true what Paul
   intimates, that afflictions avail not to advance the salvation of any
   but of those who love God; but that saying of John is equally true,
   that then only he is begun to be loved by us, when he anticipates us by
   his gratuitous love.

   But the calling of which Paul speaks here, has a wide meaning, for it
   is not to be confined to the manifestation of election, of which
   mention is presently made, but is to be set simply in opposition to the
   course pursued by men; as though Paul had said, -- "The faithful attain
   not religion by their own efforts, but are, on the contrary led by the
   hand of God, inasmuch as he has chosen them to be a peculiar people to
   himself." The word purpose distinctly excludes whatever is imagined to
   be adduced mutually by men; as though Paul had denied, that the causes
   of our election are to be sought anywhere else, except in the secret
   good pleasure of God; which subject is more fully handled in the first
   chapter to the Ephesians, and in the first of the Second Epistle to
   Timothy; where also the contrast between this purpose and human
   righteousness is more distinctly set forth. [268] Paul, however, no
   doubt made here this express declaration, -- that our salvation is
   based on the election of God, in order that he might make a transition
   to that which he immediately subjoined, namely, that by the same
   celestial decree, the afflictions, which conform us to Christ, have
   been appointed; and he did this for the purpose of connecting, as by a
   kind of necessary chain, our salvation with the bearing of the cross.

   29. For whom he has foreknown, etc. He then shows, by the very order of
   election, that the afflictions of the faithful are nothing else than
   the manner by which they are conformed to the image of Christ; and that
   this was necessary, he had before declared. There is therefore no
   reason for us to be grieved, or to think it hard and grievous, that we
   are afflicted, unless we disapprove of the Lord's election, by which we
   have been foreordained to life, and unless we are unwilling to bear the
   image of the Son of God, by which we are to be prepared for celestial
   glory.

   But the foreknowledge of God, which Paul mentions, is not a bare
   prescience, as some unwise persons absurdly imagine, but the adoption
   by which he had always distinguished his children from the reprobate.
   [269] In the same sense Peter says, that the faithful had been elected
   to the sanctification of the Spirit according to the foreknowledge of
   God. Hence those, to whom I have alluded, foolishly draw this
   inference, -- That God has elected none but those whom he foresaw would
   be worthy of his grace. Peter does not in deed flatter the faithful, as
   though every one had been elected on account of his merit; but by
   reminding them of the eternal counsel of God, he wholly deprives them
   of all worthiness. So Paul does in this passage, who repeats by another
   word what he had said before of God's purpose. It hence follows, that
   this knowledge is connected with God's good pleasure; for he foreknew
   nothing out of himself, in adopting those whom he was pleased to adopt;
   but only marked out those whom he had purposed to elect.

   The verb proorizein, which some translate, to predestinate, is to be
   understood according to what this passage requires; for Paul only
   meant, that God had so determined that all whom he has adopted should
   bear the image of Christ; nor has he simply said, that they were to be
   conformed to Christ, but to the image of Christ, that he might teach us
   that there is in Christ a living and conspicuous exemplar, which is
   exhibited to God's children for imitation. The meaning then is, that
   gratuitous adoption, in which our salvation consists, is inseparable
   from the other decree, which determines that we are to bear the cross;
   for no one can be an heir of heaven without being conformed to the
   image of the only-begotten Son of God.

   That he may be, or, that he might be, the first-born, etc.; for the
   Greek infinitive, einai, may be rendered in these two ways; but I
   prefer the first rendering. But in mentioning Christ's primogeniture,
   Paul meant only to express this, -- that since Christ possesses a
   pre-eminence among the children of God, he is rightly given to us as a
   pattern, so that we ought to refuse nothing which he has been pleased
   to undergo. Hence, that the celestial Father may in every way bear
   testimony to the authority and honor which he has conferred on his own
   Son, he will have all those whom he adopts to be the heirs of his
   kingdom, to be conformed to his example. Though indeed the condition of
   the godly is apparently various, as there is a difference between the
   members of the same body, there is yet a connection between every one
   and his own head. As then the first-born sustains the name of the
   family, so Christ is placed in a state of pre-eminence not only that he
   might excel in honor among the faithful, but also that he might include
   all under him himself under the common name of brotherhood.

   30. And whom he has foredetermined, (pr����finivit,) them has he also
   called, etc. That he might now by a clearer proof show how true it is
   that a conformity with the humiliating state of Christ is for our good,
   he adopts a graduating process, by which he teaches us, that a
   participation of the cross is so connected with our vocation,
   justification, and, in short, with our future glory, that they can by
   no means be separated.

   But that readers may better understand the Apostle's meaning, it may be
   well to repeat what I have already said, -- that the word foredetermine
   does not refer to election, but to that purpose or decree of God by
   which he has ordained that the cross is to be borne by his people; and
   by declaring that they are now called, he intimates, that God had not
   kept concealed what he had determined respecting them, but had made it
   known, that they might resignedly and humbly submit to the condition
   allotted to them; for calling here is to be distinguished from secret
   election, as being posterior to it. That none then may make this
   objection -- that it appears to no one what lot God has appointed for
   him, the Apostle says, that God by his calling bears an evident
   testimony respecting his hidden purpose. But this testimony is not only
   found in the outward preaching of the gospel, but it has also the power
   of the Spirit connected with it; for the elect are there spoken of,
   whom God not only addresses by the outward word, but whom he also
   inwardly draws.

   Justification may fitly be extended to the unremitted continuance of
   God's favor, from the time of our calling to the hour of death; but as
   Paul uses this word throughout the Epistle, for gratuitous imputation
   of righteousness, there is no necessity for us to deviate from this
   meaning. What Paul indeed had in view was to show that a more precious
   compensation is offered to us, than what ought to allow us to shun
   afflictions; for what is more desirable than to be reconciled to God,
   so that our miseries may no longer be tokens of a curse, nor lead us to
   ruin?

   He then immediately adds, that those who are now pressed down by the
   cross shall be glorified; so that their sorrows and reproaches shall
   bring them no loss. Though glorification is not yet exhibited except in
   our Head, yet as we in a manner behold in him our inheritance of
   eternal life, his glory brings to us such assurance respecting our own
   glory, that our hope may be justly compared to a present possession.

   We may add, that Paul, imitating the style of the Hebrew language,
   adopts in these verbs the past instead of the present tense. [270] A
   continued act is no doubt what is meant, according to this import,
   "Those whom God now, consistently with his purpose, exercises under the
   cross, are called and justified, that they may have a hope of
   salvation, so that nothing of their glory decays during their
   humiliation; for though their present miseries deform it before the
   world, yet before God and angels it always shines forth as perfect."
   What Paul then means by this gradation is, That the afflictions of the
   faithful, by which they are now humbled, are intended for this end --
   that the faithful, having obtained the glory of the celestial kingdom,
   may reach the glory of Christ's resurrection, with whom they are now
   crucified.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [268] Hammond has a long note on the expression, kata prothesin and
   quotes Cyril of Jerusalem, Clemens of Alexandria, and Theophylact, as
   rendering the words, "according to their purpose," that is, those who
   love God, -- a construction of itself strange, and wholly alien to the
   whole tenor of the passage, and to the use of the word in most other
   instances. Paul has never used the word, except in one instance, (2
   Timothy 3:10,) but with reference to God's purpose or decree, -- see
   Romans 9:11; Ephesians 1:11; Ephesians 3:11; 2 Timothy 1:9. It seems
   that Chrysostom, Origen, Theodoret, and other Fathers, have given the
   same singularly strange explanation. But in opposition to these, Poole
   mentions Ambrose, Augustine, and even Jerome, as regarding "the
   purpose" here as that of God: in which opinion almost all modern
   Divines agree. Grotius very justly observes, that kletoi, the called,
   according to the language of Paul, mean those who obey the call, (qui
   vocanti obediunt) and refers to Romans 1:6; 1 Corinthians 1:24;
   Revelation 17:14. And Stuart says that the word has this meaning
   throughout the New Testament, except in two instances, Matthew 20:16.
   and Matthew 22:14, where it means, invited. He therefore considers it
   as equivalent to eklektoi, chosen, elected, or true Christians. -- Ed.

   [269] Much controversy has been about the meaning of the verb proegno,
   in this place. Many of the Fathers, such as Jerome, Chrysostom, and
   Theodoret, regarded it in the sense of simple prescience, as having
   reference to those who would believe and obey the gospel. The verb is
   found only in this place, and in the following passages, Romans 11:2;
   Acts 26:5; 1 Peter 1:20; 2 Peter 3:17. In the second, and in the last
   passage, it signifies merely a previous knowledge or acquaintance, and
   refers to men. In 1 Peter 1:20, it is applied to Christ as having been
   "foreordained," according to our version, "before the foundation of the
   world." In this Epistle, Romans 11:2, it refers to God, -- "God hath
   not cast away his people whom he foreknew;" and according to the
   context, it means the same as elected; for the Apostle speaks of what
   God did "according to the election of grace," and not according to
   foreseen faith. The noun derived from it is found in two places, Acts
   2:23, and 1 Peter 1:2. In the first it evidently means decree,
   foreordination, and in the second, the same; where it is said, that
   those addressed by the Apostle were elected, "according to the
   foreknowledge of God, kata prognosin Theou, through the sanctification
   of the Spirit, unto obedience;" they were not then elected, according
   to God's foreknowledge or foreordination, because of their obedience.
   This entirely subverts the gloss put on the verb in this passage. The
   usual meaning given to the verb here is fore-approved, or chosen.
   Grotius, Turrettin, and others, consider that ginosko has the same
   meaning with the verb yd, in Hebrew, which is sometimes that of
   approving or favoring, or regarding with love and approbation. So the
   compound verb may be rendered here, "whom he fore-approved, or
   foreknew," as the objects of his choice: and this idea is what alone
   comports with the rest of the passage. Stuart prefers another meaning,
   and that which it seems to have in 1 Peter 1:20, "foreordained." He
   says that ginosko means sometimes to will, to determine, to ordain, to
   decree, and brings examples from Josephus, Plutarch, and Polybius. Then
   the compound verb would be here, "whom he foreordained," or
   foredetermined. -- Ed.

   [270] Turrettin gives somewhat a different reason: "Paul speaks of
   these things as past, because they are as already done in God's decree,
   and in order to show the certainty of their accomplishment."

   Romans 8:31-34

   31. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
   be against us?

   31. Quid ergo dicemus ad h����c? [271] Si Deus pro nobis, quis contra nos?

   32. He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,
   how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

   32. Qui propno Filio non pepercit, sed pro nobis omnibus tradidit,
   quomodo non etiam cum eo donaret nobis omnia?

   33. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God
   that justifieth.

   33. Quis intentabit crimina [272] adversus electos Dei? Deus est qui
   justificat.

   34. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that
   is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
   intercession for us.

   34. Quis ille qui condemnet? Christus est qui mortuus est, quin potius
   etiam suscitatus, qui et in dextera Patris est, qui et intercedit pro
   nobis.

   31. What then, etc. The subject discussed having been sufficiently
   proved, he now breaks out into exclamations, by which he sets forth the
   magnanimity with which the faithful ought to be furnished when
   adversities urge them to despond. And he teaches us in these words that
   with the paternal favor of God is connected that invincible courage
   which overcomes all temptations. We indeed know, that judgment is
   usually formed of the love or of the hatred of God, in no other way
   than by a view of our present state; hence when things fall out
   untowardly, sorrow takes possession of our minds, and drives away all
   confidence and consolation. But Paul loudly exclaims, that a deeper
   principle ought to be inquired after, and that they reason absurdly who
   confine themselves to the sad spectacle of our present warfare. I
   indeed allow, that the scourges of God are in themselves justly deemed
   to be tokens of God's wrath; but as they are consecrated in Christ,
   Paul bids the saints to lay hold, above all things, on the paternal
   love of God, that relying on this shield they may boldly triumph over
   all evils; for this is a brazen wall to us, so that while God is
   propitious to us we shall be safe against all dangers. He does not,
   however, mean, that nothing shall oppose us; but he promises a victory
   over all kinds of enemies.

   If God be for us, etc. This is the chief and the only support which can
   sustain us in every temptation. For except we have God propitious to
   us, though all things should smile on us, yet no sure confidence can be
   attained: but, on the other hand, his favor alone is a sufficient
   solace in every sorrow, a protection sufficiently strong against all
   the storms of adversities. And on this subject there are many
   testimonies of Scripture, which show that when the saints rely on the
   power of God alone, they dare to despise whatever is opposed to them in
   the world.

   "When I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I shall not fear
   evils, for thou art with me." (Psalm 23:4.)

   "In the Lord I trust: what shall flesh do to me."
   (Psalm 56:11.)

   "I shall not fear the thousands of the people who beset me."
   (Psalm 3:6.)

   For there is no power either under or above the heavens, which can
   resist the arm of God. Having him then as our defender, we need fear no
   harm whatever. Hence he alone shows real confidence in God, who being
   content with his protection, dreads nothing in such a way as to
   despond; the faithful are doubtless often shaken but are never utterly
   cast down. In short, the Apostle's object was to show, that the godly
   soul ought to rely on the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit, and not
   to depend on outward things.

   32. He who has not spared his own son, etc. As it greatly concerns us
   to be so thoroughly persuaded of the paternal love of God, as to be
   able to retain our rejoicing on its account, Paul brings forward the
   price of our redemption in order to prove that God favors us: and
   doubtless it is a remarkable and clear evidence of inappreciable love,
   that the Father refused not to bestow his Son for our salvation. And so
   Paul draws an argument from the greater to the less, that as he had
   nothing dearer, or more precious, or more excellent than his Son, he
   will neglect nothing of what he foresees will be profitable to us.
   [273]

   This passage ought to remind us of what Christ brings to us, and to
   awaken us to contemplate his riches; for as he is a pledge of God's
   infinite love towards us, so he has not been sent to us void of
   blessings or empty, but filled with all celestial treasures, so that
   they who possess him may not want anything necessary for their perfect
   felicity. To deliver up means here to expose to death.

   33. Who shall bring an accusation, etc. The first and the chief
   consolation of the godly in adversities, is to be fully persuaded of
   the paternal kindness of God; for hence arises the certainty of their
   salvation, and that calm quietness of the soul through which it comes
   that adversities are sweetened, or at least the bitterness of sorrow
   mitigated. Hardly then a more suitable encouragement to patience could
   be adduced than this, a conviction that God is propitious to us; and
   hence Paul makes this confidence the main ground of that consolation,
   by which it behoves the faithful to be strengthened against all evils.
   And as the salvation of man is first assailed by accusation, and then
   subverted by condemnation, he in the first place averts the danger of
   accusation. There is indeed but one God, at whose tribunal we must
   stand; then there is no room for accusation when he justifies us. The
   antithetic clauses seem not indeed to be exactly arranged; for the two
   parts which ought rather to have been set in opposition to each other
   are these: "Who shall accuse? Christ is he who intercedes:" and then
   these two might have been connected, "Who shall condemn? God is he who
   justifies;" for God's absolution answers to condemnation, and Christ's
   intercession to accusation. But Paul has not without reason made
   another arrangement, as he was anxious to arm the children of God, as
   they say, from head to foot, with that confidence which banishes all
   anxieties and fears. He then more emphatically concludes, that the
   children of God are not subject to an accusation, because God
   justifies, than if he had said that Christ is our advocate; for he more
   fully expresses that the way to a trial is more completely closed up
   when the judge himself pronounces him wholly exempt from guilt, whom
   the accuser would bring in as deserving of punishment. There is also a
   similar reason for the second clause; for he shows that the faithful
   are very far from being involved in the danger of condemnation, since
   Christ by expiating their sins has anticipated the judgment of God, and
   by his intercession not only abolishes death, but also covers our sins
   in oblivion, so that they come not to an account.

   The drift of the whole is, that we are not only freed from terror by
   present remedies, but that God comes to our aid beforehand, that he may
   better provide for our confidence.

   But it must be here observed, as we have before reminded you, that to
   be justified, according to Paul, is to be absolved by the sentence of
   God, and to be counted just; and it is not difficult to prove this from
   the present passage, in which he reasons by affirming one thing which
   nullifies its opposite; for to absolve and to regard persons as guilty,
   are contrary things. Hence God will allow no accusation against us,
   because he has absolved us from all sins. The devil no doubt is an
   accuser of all the godly: the very law of God and their own conscience
   convict them; but all these prevail nothing with the judge, who
   justifies them. Therefore no adversary can shake or endanger our
   salvation.

   Further, he so mentions the elect, as one who doubted not but that he
   was of their number; and he knew this, not by special revelation, (as
   some sophists falsely imagine,) but by a perception (sensu - feeling)
   common to all the godly. What then is here said of the elect, every one
   of the godly, according to the example of Paul, may apply to himself;
   for this doctrine would have been not only frigid, but wholly lifeless
   had he buried election in the secret purpose of God. But when we know,
   that there is here designedly set before us what every one of the godly
   ought to appropriate to himself, there is no doubt but that we are all
   encouraged to examine our calling, so that we may become assured that
   we are the children of God.

   34. Who is he that condemns? etc. As no one by accusing can prevail,
   when the judge absolves; so there remains no condemnation, when
   satisfaction is given to the laws, and the penalty is already paid. Now
   Christ is he, who, having once for all suffered the punishment due to
   us, thereby declared that he undertook our cause, in order to deliver
   us: he then who seeks hereafter to condemn us, must bring back Christ
   himself to death again. But he has not only died, but also came forth,
   by a resurrection, as the conqueror of death and triumphed over all its
   power.

   He adds still more, -- that he now sits at the right hand of the
   Father; by which is meant, that he possesses dominion over heaven and
   earth, and full power and rule over all things, according to what is
   said in Ephesians 1:20. He teaches us also, that he thus sits, that he
   may be a perpetual advocate and intercessor in securing our salvation.
   It hence follows, that when any one seeks to condemn us, he not only
   seeks to render void the death of Christ, but also contends with that
   unequalled power with which the Father has honored him, and who with
   that power conferred on him supreme authority. This so great an
   assurance; which dares to triumph over the devil, death, sin, and the
   gates of hell, ought to lodge deep in the hearts of all the godly; for
   our faith is nothing, except we feel assured that Christ is ours, and
   that the Father is in him propitious to us. Nothing then can be devised
   more pestilent and ruinous, than the scholastic dogma respecting the
   uncertainty of salvation.

   Who intercedes, etc. It was necessary expressly to add this, lest the
   Divine majesty of Christ should terrify us. Though, then, from his
   elevated throne he holds all things in subjection under his feet, yet
   Paul represents him as a Mediator; whose presence it would be strange
   for us to dread, since he not only kindly invites us to himself, but
   also appears an intercessor for us before the Father. But we must not
   measure this intercession by our carnal judgment; for we must not
   suppose that he humbly supplicates the Father with bended knees and
   expanded hands; but as he appears continually, as one who died and rose
   again, and as his death and resurrection stand in the place of eternal
   intercession, and have the efficacy of a powerful prayer for
   reconciling and rendering the Father propitious to us, he is justly
   said to intercede for us.

   also a question; and also the clauses in the next verse. There is not
   much difference in the sense, but the passage will thus appear more
   striking, -- 33. Who will lay a charge against God's elect? God the
   justifier? 34. Who is he who condemns? Christ who died, or rather who
   rose again, who is also at God's right hand, and who intercedes for us?
   What favors this construction is, that the Apostle proceeds in the same
   strain. -- Ed.

   [273] Calvin renders charisetai by "donaret;" Capellus more fully,
   "gratis donabit -- will gratuitously give." Christ himself, and
   everything that comes with or through him, is a favor freely bestowed,
   and not what we merit. This shuts out, as Pareus observes, everything
   as meritorious on the part of man. All is grace. The "all things"
   include every thing necessary for salvation -- every grace now and
   eternal glory hereafter. -- Ed.

   Romans 8:35-37

   35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
   or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
   sword?

   35. Quis nos dirimet [274] a dilectione Christi? tribulatio, an
   angustia, an persequutio, an fames, an nuditas, an periculum, an
   gladius?

   36. As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we
   are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

   36. Quemadmodum scriptum est, Quod propter te morimur quotidie,
   reputati sumus tanquam oves mactationi destinat����:

   37. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
   that loved us.

   37. Sed in iis omnibus supervincimus per eum qui dilexit nos.

   35. Who shall separate us, etc. The conviction of safety is now more
   widely extended, even to lower things; for he who is persuaded of God's
   kindness towards him, is able to stand firm in the heaviest
   afflictions. These usually harass men in no small degree, and for
   various reasons, -- because they interpret them as tokens of God's
   wrath, or think themselves to be forsaken by God, or see no end to
   them, or neglect to meditate on a better life, or for other similar
   reasons; but when the mind is purged from such mistakes, it becomes
   calm, and quietly rests. But the import of the words is, -- That
   whatever happens, we ought to stand firm in this faith, -- that God,
   who once in his love embraced us, never ceases to care for us. For he
   does not simply say that there is nothing which can tear God away from
   his love to us; but he means, that the knowledge and lively sense of
   the love which he testifies to us is so vigorous in our hearts, that it
   always shines in the darkness of afflictions: for as clouds, though
   they obscure the clear brightness of the sun, do not yet wholly deprive
   us of its light; so God, in adversities, sends forth through the
   darkness the rays of his favor, lest temptations should overwhelm us
   with despair; nay, our faith, supported by God's promises as by wings,
   makes its way upward to heaven through all the intervening obstacles.
   It is indeed true, that adversities are tokens of God's wrath, when
   viewed in themselves; but when pardon and reconciliation precede, we
   ought to be assured that God, though he chastises us, yet never forgets
   his mercy: he indeed thus reminds us of what we have deserved; but he
   no less testifies, that our salvation is an object of his care, while
   he leads us to repentance.

   But he calls it the love of Christ, and for this reason, -- because the
   Father has in a manner opened his compassions to us in him. As then the
   love of God is not to be sought out of Christ, Paul rightly directs to
   him our attention, so that our faith may behold, in the rays of
   Christ's favor, the serene countenance of the Father. The meaning is,
   -- that in no adversities ought our confidence to be shaken as to this
   truth -- that when God is propitious, nothing can be adverse to us.
   Some take this love in a passive sense, for that by which he is loved
   by us, as though Paul would have us armed with invincible courage [275]
   but this comment may be easily disproved by the whole tenor of Paul's
   reasoning; and Paul himself will presently remove all doubt by defining
   more clearly what this love is.

   Tribulation, or distress, or persecution? etc. The pronoun masculine
   which he used at the beginning of the verse, contains a hidden power:
   for when he might have adopted the neuter gender and said -- "What
   shall separate us?" etc., he preferred ascribing personality to things
   without life, and for this end, -- that he might send forth with us
   into the contest as many champions as there are of temptations to try
   our faith.

   But these three things have this difference: tribulation includes every
   kind of trouble or evil; distress is an inward feeling, when
   difficulties reduce us to such an extremity, so that we know not what
   course to pursue. Such was the anxiety of Abraham and of Lot, when one
   was constrained to expose his wife to the danger of prostitution, and
   the other, his daughters; for being brought to straits and being
   perplexed, they found no way of escape. Persecution properly denotes
   the tyrannical violence by which the children of God were undeservedly
   harassed by the ungodly. Now though Paul denies in 2 Corinthians 4:8,
   that the children of God are reduced to straits, stenochoreisthai, he
   does not yet disagree with himself; for he does not simply make them to
   be exempt from anxious solicitude, but he means that they are delivered
   from it, as also the examples of Abraham and Lot testify.

   36. As it is written, etc. This testimony adds no small weight to the
   subject; for he intimates, that the dread of death is so far from being
   a reason to us for falling away, that it has been almost ever the lot
   of God's servants to have death as it were present before their eyes.
   It is indeed probable, that in that Psalm the miserable oppression of
   the people under the tyranny of Antiochus is described; for it is
   expressly said, that the worshippers of God were cruelly treated, for
   no other reason but through hatred to true religion. There is also
   added a remarkable protestation, that they had not departed from the
   covenant of God; which Paul, I think, had especially in view. It is no
   objection that the saints there complain of a calamity which then
   unusually pressed on them; for since they show, that they were
   oppressed with so many evils, having before testified their innocence,
   an argument is hence fitly drawn, that it is no new thing for the Lord
   to permit his saints to be undeservedly exposed to the cruelty of the
   ungodly. But this is not done except for their good; for the Scripture
   teaches us, that it is alien to the righteousness of God to destroy the
   just with the wicked, (Genesis 18:23); but that, on the contrary, it is
   meet for him to requite affliction to those who afflict, and rest to
   those who are afflicted. (2 Thessalonians 1:6, 9.) And then they affirm
   that they suffer for the Lord; and Christ pronounces them blessed who
   suffer for the sake of righteousness. (Matthew 5:10.) By saying that
   they died daily, they intimated that death was so suspended over them,
   that their life differed but little from death.

   37. We do more than conquer, etc.; that is, we always struggle and
   emerge. I have retained the word used by Paul, [276] though not
   commonly used by the Latins. It indeed sometimes happens that the
   faithful seem to succumb and to lie forlorn; and thus the Lord not only
   tries, but also humbles them. This issue is however given to them, --
   that they obtain the victory.

   That they might at the same time remember whence this invincible power
   proceeds, he again repeats what he had said before: for he not only
   teaches us that God, because he loves us, supports us by his hand; but
   he also confirms the same truth by mentioning the love of Christ. [277]
   And this one sentence sufficiently proves, that the Apostle speaks not
   here of the fervency of that love which we have towards God, but of the
   paternal kindness of God and of Christ towards us, the assurance of
   which, being thoroughly fixed in our hearts, will always draw us from
   the gates of hell into the light of life, and will sufficiently avail
   for our support.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [274] "Dirimet -- break us off," divide or part us; chorisei -- set
   apart, sever, separate: tis, "who," may be rendered, "what," as my in
   Hebrew. It is not put, it may be, in the neuter gender, because of the
   gender of the nouns which follow. As the Hebrews use often the future
   for the potential mood, so the case may be here -- "What can separate
   us from the love of Christ? tribulation, or distress?" etc. It ought
   also to be added, that the verb "separate," is used to designate
   divorce or separation between man and his wife. See Matthew 19:6; 1
   Corinthians 7:10, 11, 15. -- Ed.

   [275] According to Poole, several of the Fathers entertained this
   opinion, such as Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Ambrose: but even
   Hammond and Grotius, great admirers of the Fathers, regard this love as
   that of God or of Christ to us. Wolfius says, that all the Lutheran
   divines give this exposition. It is indeed impossible rightly to view
   the whole passage without seeing that this explanation is the true one.
   In verse 32, it is incontestably evident that God's love to us is what
   is spoken of: then in verse 37, it is expressly said, "through him who
   loved us;" and the last verse seems sufficient to remove every possible
   doubt. The difficulty of Barnes, in thinking it "not conceivable how
   afflictions should have any tendency to alienate Christ's love from
   us," arises from a misconception: for when we speak of not being
   separated from the love of Christ, the obvious meaning is, that nothing
   can separate us from participating in the effects of his love, that He,
   on account of his love, will sustain us under the greatest trials, and
   make "us more than conquerors." The substance of what is here said, is
   contained in the last clause of Romans 8:32, -- "How shall he not with
   him also freely give us all things?" It was the assurance of this truth
   that the Apostle obviously intended to convey. -- Ed.

   [276] "Supervincimus" -- hupernikomen; Beza's version is, amplius quam
   victores sumus;" Macknight's, "we do more than overcome;" Schleusner
   gives this as one of his explanations, "plenissime vincimus -- we most
   fully overcome." Paul commonly uses huper in an enhansive sense; so the
   version may be, "we abundantly overcome," as though he said, "We have
   strength given us which far exceeds the power of evils." Some say that
   the faithful abundantly overcome, because they sustain no real loss,
   but like silver in the furnace, they lose only their dross; and not
   only so, but they also carry, as it were from the field of battle,
   chapter spoils -- the fruits of holiness and righteousness. Hebrews
   12:10,11. It is further said, that the victory will be this, -- that
   Christ, who has loved them, will raise them from death and adorn them
   with that glory, with which all the evils of this life are not worthy
   to be compared. Beza says, "Not only we are not broken down by so many
   evils nor despond, but we even glory in the cross." -- Ed.

   [277] "Per eum qui dilexit nos -- dia tou agapesantos hemas -- through
   him who has loved us." The aorist participle, says Wolfius, extends to
   every time, "who has loved and loves and will love us." From the fact
   that believers are overcome by no calamities, he draws the inference,
   that God's love is constant and most effectual, so that he is present
   with the distressed to give them courage, to strengthen their patience,
   and to moderate their calamities. See 1 Peter 5:10. -- Ed.

   Romans 8:38-39

   38. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

   38. Persuasus enim sum, quod neque mors, neque vita, [278] neque angeli
   neque principatus, neque virtutes, neque principatus, neque virtutes,
   neque pr����asentia, neque futura,

   39. Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
   separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   39. Neque altitudo, neque profunditas, neque ulla alia creatura,
   poterit nos dirimere a charitate Dei, Qu���� est in Christo Iesu.

   38. He is now carried away into hyperbolic expressions, that he might
   confirm us more fully in those things which are to be experienced.
   Whatever, he says, there is in life or in death, which seems capable of
   tearing us away from God, shall effect nothing; nay, the very angels,
   were they to attempt to overturn this foundation, shall do us no harm.
   It is no objection, that angels are ministering spirits, appointed for
   the salvation of the elect, (Hebrews 1:14:) for Paul reasons here on
   what is impossible, as he does in Galatians 1:8; and we may hence
   observe, that all things ought to be deemed of no worth, compared with
   the glory of God, since it is lawful to dishonor even angels in
   vindicating his truth. [279] Angels are also meant by principalities
   and powers, [280] and they are so called, because they are the primary
   instruments of the Divine power: and these two words were added, that
   if the word angels sounded too insignificant, something more might be
   expressed. But you would, perhaps, prefer this meaning, "Nor angels,
   and whatever powers there may be;" which is a mode of speaking that is
   used, when we refer to things unknown to us, and exceeding our
   capacities.

   Nor present things, nor future things, etc. Though he speaks
   hyperbolically, yet he declares, that by no length of time can it be
   effected, that we should be separated from the Lord's favor: and it was
   needful to add this; for we have not only to struggle with the sorrow
   which we feel from present evils, but also with the fear and the
   anxiety with which impending dangers may harass us. [281] The meaning
   then is, -- that we ought not to fear, lest the continuance of evils,
   however long, should obliterate the faith of adoption.

   This declaration is clearly against the schoolmen, who idly talk and
   say, that no one is certain of final perseverance, except through the
   gift of special revelation, which they make to be very rare. By such a
   dogma the whole faith is destroyed, which is certainly nothing, except
   it extends to death and beyond death. But we, on the contrary, ought to
   feel confident, that he who has begun in us a good work, will carry it
   on until the day of the Lord Jesus. [282]

   39. Which is in Christ, etc. That is, of which Christ is the bond; for
   he is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. If, then, we
   are through him united to God, we may be assured of the immutable and
   unfailing kindness of God towards us. He now speaks here more
   distinctly than before, as he declares that the fountain of love is in
   the Father, and affirms that it flows to us from Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [278] Neither death threatened by persecutors, nor life promised on
   recantation. -- Ed.

   [279] Some of the Fathers, Jerome, Chrysostom, etc., have taken the
   same view, regarding the Apostle as speaking of good angels, as it
   were, hypothetically, as in Galatians 1:8. But Grotius, and many
   others, consider evil angels to be meant. Probably, angels, without any
   regard to what they are, are intended. -- Ed.

   [280] Grotius considers the words as being the abstract for the
   concrete, Princes and Potentates; being called archai, as some think,
   as being the first, the chief in authority, and dunameis, as having
   power. "By these words," says Beza, "Paul is wont to designate the
   character of spirits, -- of the good in Ephesians 1:21; Colossians
   1:16, -- and of the bad in Ephesians 6:12, Colossians 2:15." Hence the
   probability is, that the words designate different ranks among angelic
   powers, without any reference to their character, whether good or evil.
   -- Ed.

   [281] "Neither the evils we now feel, nor those which may await us," --
   Grotius; rather, "Neither things which now exist, nor things which
   shall be." -- Ed.

   [282] The words, "neither height nor depth," are left unnoticed
   hupsoma. The first, says Mede, means prosperity, and the latter,
   adversity. Grotius regards what is meant as the height of honor, and
   the depth of disgrace. "Neither heaven nor hell," say others; "neither
   heaven nor earth," according to Schleusner. "Things in heaven and
   things on earth," is the explanation of Chrysostom The first, hupsoma,
   is only found here and in 2 Corinthians 10:5. Like mrvm in Hebrew, it
   means what is high and elevated, and may, like that, sometimes signify
   heaven: and bathos is not earth, but what is deeper; it means a deep
   soil, Matthew 13:5, -- the deep sea, Luke 5:4, -- and in the plural,
   things deep and inscrutable, 1 Corinthians 2:10; it may therefore be
   very properly taken here for hell. That the words are to be thus taken
   seems probable from the gradation evident in the passage. In the first
   catalogue in Romans 8:35, he mentions the evils arising from this
   world, its trials and its persecutions, and those ending in death. In
   the second, after repeating the utmost length to which worldly
   persecutors can go, "death or life," he ascends the invisible world,
   and mentions angels, then their combined powers, then the powers which
   do and may exist, then both heaven and hell, and, that he might include
   everything, except the uncreated God himself, he finishes with the
   words, "nor any created thing." The whole passage is sublime in an
   extraordinary degree. The contrast is the grandest that can be
   conceived. Here is the Christian, all weakness in himself, despised and
   trampled under foot by the world, triumphing over all existing, and all
   possible, and even impossible evils and opposition, having only this as
   his stay and support -- that the God who has loved him, will never
   cease to love, keep, and defend him; yea, were everything created,
   everything except God himself, leagued against him and attempting his
   ruin. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 9
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 9:1-5

   1. I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me
   witness in the Holy Ghost,

   1. Veritatem dico in Christo, non mentior, testimonium simul mihi
   reddente mea conscientia eum Spiritu sancto,

   2. That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

   2. Quod dolor sit mihi magnus, et assiduus cruciatus cordi meo:

   3. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
   brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

   3. Optarim enim ego ipse anathema esse a Christo pro fratribus meis,
   cognatis inquam meis secundum carnem;

   4. Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory,
   and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God,
   and the promises;

   4. Qui sunt Israelitae, quorum est adoptio, et gloria, et testamenta,
   et legislatio, et cultus, et promissiones;

   5. Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
   came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

   5. Quorum sunt Patres, et ex quibus est Christus secundum car-nem, qui
   est super omnia Deus benedictus in secula. Amen.

   In this chapter he begins to remove the offences which might have
   diverted the minds of men from Christ: for the Jews, for whom he was
   appointed according to the covenant of the law, not only rejected him,
   but regarded him with contempt, and for the most part hated him. Hence
   one of two things seemed to follow, -- either that there was no truth
   in the Divine promise, -- or that Jesus, whom Paul preached, was not
   the Lord's anointed, who had been especially promised to the Jews. This
   twofold knot Paul fully unties in what follows. He, however, so handles
   this subject, as to abstain from all bitterness against the Jews, that
   he might not exasperate their minds; and yet he concedes to them
   nothing to the injury of the gospel; for he allows to them their
   privileges in such a way, as not to detract anything from Christ. But
   he passes, as it were abruptly, to the mention of this subject, so that
   there appears to be no connection in the discourse. [283] He, however,
   so enters on this new subject, as though he had before referred to it.
   It so happened in this way, -- Having finished the doctrine he
   discussed, he turned his attention to the Jews, and being astonished at
   their unbelief as at something monstrous, he burst forth into this
   sudden protestation, in the same way as though it was a subject which
   he had previously handled; for there was no one to whom this thought
   would not of itself immediately occur, -- "If this be the doctrine of
   the law and the Prophets, how comes it that the Jews so pertinaciously
   reject it?" And further, it was everywhere known, that all that he had
   hitherto spoken of the law of Moses, and of the grace of Christ, was
   more disliked by the Jews, than that the faith of the Gentiles should
   be assisted by their consent. It was therefore necessary to remove this
   obstacle, lest it should impede the course of the gospel.

   1. The truth I say in Christ, etc. As it was an opinion entertained by
   most that Paul was, as it were, a sworn enemy to his own nation, and as
   it was suspected somewhat even by the household of faith, as though he
   had taught them to forsake Moses, he adopts a preface to prepare the
   minds of his readers, before he proceeds to his subject, and in this
   preface he frees himself from the false suspicion of evil will towards
   the Jews. And as the matter was not unworthy of an oath, and as he
   perceived that his affirmation would hardly be otherwise believed
   against a prejudice already entertained, he declares by an oath that he
   speaks the truth. By this example and the like, (as I reminded you in
   the first chapter,) we ought to learn that oaths are lawful, that is,
   when they render that truth credible which is necessary to be known,
   and which would not be otherwise believed.

   The expression, In Christ, means "according to Christ." [284] By adding
   I lie not, he signifies that he speaks without fiction or disguise. My
   conscience testifying to me, etc. By these words he calls his own
   conscience before the tribunal of God, for he brings in the Spirit as a
   witness to his feeling. He adduced the Spirit for this end, that he
   might more fully testify that he was free and pure from an evil
   disposition, and that he pleaded the cause of Christ under the guidance
   and direction of the Spirit of God. It often happens that a person,
   blinded by the passions of the flesh, (though not purposing to
   deceive,) knowingly and wilfully obscures the light of truth. But to
   swear by the name of God, in a proper sense of the word, is to call him
   as a witness for the purpose of confirming what is doubtful, and at the
   same time to bind ourselves over to his judgment, in case we say what
   is false.

   2. That I have great sorrow, etc. He dexterously manages so to cut
   short his sentence as not yet to express what he was going to say; for
   it was not as yet seasonable openly to mention the destruction of the
   Jewish nation. It may be added, that he thus intimates a greater
   measure of sorrow, as imperfect sentences are for the most part full of
   pathos. But he will presently express the cause of his sorrow, after
   having more fully testified his sincerity.

   But the perdition of the Jews caused very great anguish to Paul, though
   he knew that it happened through the will and providence of God. We
   hence learn that the obedience we render to God's providence does not
   prevent us from grieving at the destruction of lost men, though we know
   that they are thus doomed by the just judgment of God; for the same
   mind is capable of being influenced by these two feelings: that when it
   looks to God it can willingly bear the ruin of those whom he has
   decreed to destroy; and that when it turns its thoughts to men, it
   condoles with their evils. They are then much deceived, who say that
   godly men ought: to have apathy and insensibility, (apatheian kai
   analgesian) lest they should resist the decree of God.

   3. For I could wish, etc. He could not have expressed a greater ardour
   of love than by what he testifies here; for that is surely perfect love
   which refuses not to die for the salvation of a friend. But there is
   another word added, anathema, which proves that he speaks not only of
   temporal but of eternal death; and he explains its meaning when he
   says, from Christ, for it signifies a separation. And what is to be
   separated from Christ, but to be excluded from the hope of salvation?
   It was then a proof of the most ardent love, that Paul hesitated not to
   wish for himself that condemnation which he saw impending over the
   Jews, in order that he might deliver them. It is no objection that he
   knew that his salvation was based on the election of God, which could
   by no means fail; for as those ardent feelings hurry us on impetuously,
   so they see and regard nothing but the object in view. So Paul did not
   connect God's election with his wish, but the remembrance of that being
   passed by, he was wholly intent on the salvation of the Jews.

   Many indeed doubt whether this was a lawful desire; but this doubt may
   be thus removed: the settled boundary of love is, that it proceeds as
   far as conscience permits; [285] if then we love in God and not without
   God's authority, our love can never be too much. And such was the love
   of Paul; for seeing his own nation endued with so many of God's
   benefits, he loved God's gifts in them, and them on account of God's
   gifts; and he deemed it a great evil that those gifts should perish,
   hence it was that his mind being overwhelmed, he burst forth into this
   extreme wish. [286]

   Thus I consent not to the opinion of those who think that Paul spoke
   these words from regard to God only, and not to men; nor do I agree
   with others, who say, that without any thought of God, he was
   influenced only by love to men: but I connect the love of men with a
   zeal for God's glory.

   I have not, however, as yet explained that which is the chief thing, --
   that the Jews are here regarded as they were adorned with those
   singular tokens, by which they were distinguished from the rest of
   mankind. For God had by his covenant so highly exalted them, that by
   their fall, the faithfulness and truth of God himself seemed also to
   fail in the world: for that covenant would have thus become void, the
   stability of which was promised to be perpetual, as long as the sun and
   moon should shine in heaven. (Psalm 72:7.) So that the abolition of
   this would have been more strange, than the sad and ruinous confusion
   of the whole world. It was not therefore a simple and exclusive regard
   for men: for though it is better that one member should perish than the
   whole body; it was yet for this reason that Paul had such a high regard
   for the Jews, because he viewed them as bearing the character, and, as
   they commonly say, the quality of an elect people; and this will appear
   more evident, as we shall soon see, from what follows.

   The words, my kinsmen according to the flesh, though they contain
   nothing new, do yet serve much for amplification. For first, lest any
   one should think that he willingly, or of his own accord, sought cause
   of quarrel with the Jews, he intimates, that he had not put off the
   feeling of kindred, so as not to be affected with the destruction of
   his own flesh. And secondly, since it was necessary that the gospel, of
   which he was the preacher, should go forth from Sion, he does not in
   vain pronounce an eulogy in so many words on his own kindred. For the
   qualifying expression, according to the flesh, is not in my view added
   for the sake of extenuation, as in other places, but, on the contrary,
   for the sake of expressing his faith: for though the Jews had disowned
   Paul, he yet concealed not the fact, that he had sprung from that
   nation, the election of whom was still strong in the root, though the
   branches had withered. What Budoeus says of the word anathema, is
   inconsistent with the opinion of Chrysostom, who makes anathema and
   anathema, to be the same.

   4. Who are Israelites, etc. Here the reason is now more plainly given,
   why the destruction of that people caused him so much anguish, that he
   was prepared to redeem them by his own death, namely because they were
   Israelites; for the relative pronoun is put here instead of a causative
   adverb. In like manner this anxiety took hold on Moses, when he desired
   that he should be blotted out of the book of life, rather than that the
   holy and chosen race of Abraham should be reduced to nothing. (Exodus
   32:32.) Then in addition to his kind feeling, he mentions also other
   reasons, and those of a higher kind, which made him to favor the Jews,
   even because the Lord had, as it were, by a kind of privilege, so
   raised them, that they were separated from the common order of men: and
   these titles of dignity were testimonies of love; for we are not wont
   to speak thus favorably, but of those whom we love. And though by their
   ingratitude they rendered themselves unworthy to be esteemed on account
   of these gifts of God, yet Paul continued justly to respect them, that
   he might teach us that the ungodly cannot so contaminate the good
   endowments of God, but that they always deserve to be praised and
   admired: at the same time, those who abuse them acquire thereby nothing
   but a greater obloquy. But as we are not to act in such a manner as to
   contemn, through a detestation of the ungodly, the gifts of God in
   them; so, on the other hand, we must use prudence, lest by our kind
   esteem and regard for them we make them proud, and especially lest our
   praises bear the appearance of flattery. But let us imitate Paul, who
   conceded to the Jews their privileges in such a manner, that he
   afterwards declared that they were all of no worth without Christ. But
   it was not in vain that he mentioned this as one of their praises, --
   that they were Israelites; for Jacob prayed for this as a great favor,
   that they should be called by his name. (Genesis 48:16.)

   Whose are the adoption, etc. The whole drift of Paul's discourse is to
   this purpose, -- that though the Jews by their defection had produced
   an ungodly divorce between God and themselves, yet the light of God's
   favor was not wholly extinguished, according to what he had also said
   in Romans 3:3. They had indeed become unbelievers and had broken his
   covenant; but still their perfidy had not rendered void the
   faithfulness of God; for he had not only reserved for himself some
   remnant seed from the whole multitude, but had as yet continued,
   according to their hereditary right, the mime of a Church among them.

   But though they had already stripped themselves of these ornaments, so
   that it availed them nothing to be called the children of Abraham, yet
   as there was a danger, lest through their fault the majesty of the
   gospel should be depreciated among the Gentiles, Paul does not regard
   what they deserved, but covers their baseness and disgraceful conduct
   by throwing vails over them, until the Gentiles were fully persuaded,
   that the gospel had flowed to them from the celestial fountain, from
   the sanctuary of God, from an elect nation. For the Lord, passing by
   other nations, had selected them as a people peculiar to himself, and
   had adopted them as his children, as he often testifies by Moses and
   the prophets; and not content simply to give them the name of children,
   he calls them sometimes his first-begotten, and sometimes his beloved.
   So the Lord says in Exodus 4:22, --

   "My first-begotten son is Israel; let my son go,
   that he may serve me."

   In Jeremiah 31:9, it is said,

   "I am become a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-begotten:"

   and again, "Is not my son Ephraim precious to me? Is he not a
   delightful child? Hence troubled for him are my bowels, and I will yet
   pity him." By these words he means, not only to set forth his kindness
   towards the people of Israel, but rather to exhibit the efficacy of
   adoption, through which the promise of the celestial inheritance is
   conveyed.

   Glory means the excellency into which the Lord had raised up that
   people above all other nations, and that in many and various ways, and
   especially by dwelling in the midst of them; for besides many other
   tokens of his presence, he exhibited a singular proof of it in the ark,
   where he gave responses, and also heard his people, that he might show
   forth his power in helping them: and for this reason it was called "the
   glory of God." (1 Samuel 4:22.) [287]

   As he has distinguished here between covenants [288] and promises, we
   may observe this difference, -- that a covenant is that which is
   expressed in distinct and accustomed words, and contains a mutual
   stipulation, as that which was made with Abraham; but promises are what
   we meet with everywhere in Scripture; for when God had once made a
   covenant with his ancient people, he continued to offer, often by new
   promises, his favor to them. It hence follows, that promises are to be
   traced up to the covenant as to their true source; in the same manner
   as the special helps of God, by which he testifies his love towards the
   faithful, may be said to flow from the true fountain of election. And
   as the law was nothing more than a renewal of the covenant, and more
   fully sanctioned the remembrance of it, legislation, or the giving of
   the law, seems to be here peculiarly applied to the things which the
   law decreed: for it was no common honor conferred on the Jewish people,
   that they had God as their lawgiver. For if some gloried in their
   Solons and Lycurguses, how much more reason was there to glory in the
   Lord? of this you have an account in Deuteronomy 4:32. By worship he
   understands that part of the law in which the legitimate manner of
   worshipping God is prescribed, such as rites and ceremonies. These
   ought to have been deemed lawful on account of God's appointment;
   without which, whatever men devise is nothing but a profanation of
   religion.

   5. Whose are the fathers, etc. It is indeed of some importance to be
   descended from saints and men beloved of God, since God promised to the
   godly fathers mercy with regard to their children, even to thousand
   generations, and especially in the words addressed to Abraham, Isaac,
   and Jacob, as we find in Genesis 17:4, and in other passages. It
   matters not, that this by itself, when separated from the fear of God
   and holiness of life, is vain and useless: for we find the same to have
   been the case as to worship and glory, as it is evident everywhere in
   the prophets, especially in Isaiah 1:11; Isaiah 60:1; and also in
   Jeremiah 7:4. But, as God dignified these things, when joined with
   attention to godliness, with some degree of honor, he justly enumerated
   them among the privileges of the Jews. They are indeed said to be the
   heirs of the promises for this very reason, -- because they descended
   from the fathers. (Acts 3:25.)

   From whom, is Christ, etc. They who apply this to the fathers, as
   though Paul meant only to say that Christ had descended from the
   fathers, have no reason to allege: for his object was to close his
   account of the pre-eminence of the Jews by this encomium, -- that
   Christ proceeded from them; for it was not a thing to be lightly
   esteemed, to have been united by a natural relationship with the
   Redeemer of the world; for if he had honored the whole human race, in
   joining himself to us by a community of nature, much more did he honor
   them, with whom he had a closer bond of union. It must at the same time
   be always maintained, that when this favor of being allied by kindred
   is unconnected with godliness, it is so far from being an advantage,
   that on the contrary it leads to a greater condemnation.

   But we have here a remarkable passage, -- that in Christ two natures
   are in such a manner distinguished, that they are at the same time
   united in the very person of Christ: for by saying that Christ had
   descended from the Jews, he declared his real humanity. The words
   according to the flesh, which are added, imply that he had something
   superior to flesh; and here seems to be an evident distinction made
   between humanity and divinity. But he at last connects both together,
   where he says, that the Christ, who had descended from the Jew's
   according to the flesh, is God blessed for ever.

   We must further observe, that this ascription of praise belongs to none
   but only to the true and eternal God; for he declares in another place,
   (1 Timothy 1:17,) that it is the true God alone to whom honor and glory
   are due. They who break off this clause from the previous context, that
   they may take away from Christ so clear a testimony to his divinity,
   most presumptuously attempt, to introduce darkness in the midst of the
   clearest light; for the words most evidently mean this, -- Christ, who
   is from the Jews according to the flesh, is God blessed for ever [289]
   And I doubt not, but that Paul, who had to contend hard with a reproach
   urged against him, did designedly raise up his own mind to the
   contemplation of the eternal glory of Christ; nor did he do this so
   much for his own sake individually, as for the purpose of encouraging
   others by his example to raise up their thoughts.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [283] The connection seems to be this: he had been speaking of the
   impossibility of separating God's people from the protecting influence
   and preserving power of his love; he had clearly shown, that no divorce
   or separation can take place through any possible circumstances. Then
   the Jews might say, "If this be true, then we are safe, we are still
   God's people." Hence he proceeds to remove this objection, and in order
   to prepare their mind to receive what he is going to say and to prove,
   he speaks first of his deep concern for their welfare: and then he
   resumes the doctrine he touched upon in Romans 8:28, 29, and 30, and
   illustrates it by a reference to the past dealings of God with the
   Jews, and proves it by passages from the ancient Prophets. He shows
   that God's people are the called according to his purpose, and not all
   who wear the outward symbol of his covenant -- Ed.

   [284] "Idem valet ac secundum Christum, -- it is the same with
   According to Christ;" "lego en Christo -- I speak in Christ," that is,
   as a Christian; to be in Christ and to be a Christian is the same. This
   idea bears on the import of the passage more than any other. It is as
   though he said, "Though I am in Christ or a Christian, yet I tell you
   this as the truth or the fact, and I have the testimony of conscience
   enlightened by the Spirit, that I have great grief and unceasing sorrow
   on your account." The Jews had the impression that the Apostle, having
   become the follower of Christ, must have necessarily entertained hatred
   towards them, and must have therefore felt no concern for them; for
   this is really the case with all real apostates, that is, with those
   who leave the truth for error, but not with them who leave error for
   the truth. To obviate this impression seems to have been the object
   here. How the idea of an oath comports with what follows it is
   difficult to see. It is no argument to say that what is here means the
   same as in Matthew 5:34, where it follows the verb "to swear." There is
   a passage similar to this in Ephesians 4:17; but en kurio there clearly
   signifies "by the Lord's authority." We may add, that to swear by
   Christ would have had no influence on the Jews. -- Ed.

   [285] "Ut ad aras usque procedat." Ainsworth gives a similar phrase and
   explains its reason, "Usque ad aras amicus -- As far as conscience
   permits," Gell., because in swearing they held the horns of the altar.
   -- Ed.

   [286] Most of those who take this view of the passage express the
   implied condition more distinctly than is done here. They have regarded
   the wish in this sense, "I could wish were it right or lawful." So
   thought Chrysostom, Photius, Theophlylact, Luther, Parcus, Beza,
   Estius, Lightfoot, Witsius, Mode, Whitby, and others. The words of
   Photius are given by Wolfius, "He says not, I wish to be separated, but
   I could wish, that is, were it possible -- euchomen an tout estin ei
   dunaton en," Stuart and Hodge adopt the same view. "It was a
   conditional wish," says Pareus, "like that of Christ in Matthew 26:39.
   Christ knew and Paul knew that it could not be granted, and yet both
   expressed their strong desire." See Exodus 32:32 Almost all critics
   agree that the Vulgate is wrong in rendering the verb optabam -- "I did
   wish," as though the Apostle referred to the time, as Ambrose supposed,
   when he was a Pharisee; but this is wholly inconsistent with the tenor
   of the passage. Erasmus, Grotius, Beza, and most others regard the verb
   as having an optative meaning; an being understood after it, as the
   case is with eboulomen in Acts 25:22, and ethelon in Galatians 4:20
   There are two other opinions which deserve notice. The first is, that
   "anathema" here means excommunication, and that "from Christ" signifies
   from his Church, Christ the head being taken for his body the Church,
   as in 1 Corinthians 12:12, and in Galatians 3:27, according to the
   manner of the Hebrews, as Grotius says, who called the wife by the name
   of the husband, Isaiah. 4:1. This is the view taken by Hammond,
   Grotius, and some of the Lutheran divines. But the word "anathema" has
   not in Scripture this meaning, though in after-ages it had attained it
   both in the Church and among the Rabbins. In the New Testament it
   occurs only here and in Acts 23:14; 1 Corinthians 12:3; 16:22; and
   Galatians 1:8, 9; and the verb anathematizo is found in Mark 14:71;
   Acts 23:12, 14, 21; and with kata prefixed in Matthew 26:74. The
   corresponding word in Hebrew, hrm, rendered "anathema" by the
   Septuagint, means two things: what is separated for a holy purpose and
   wholly devoted to God, incapable of being redeemed, Leviticus 27:28;
   and what is set apart and devoted to death or destruction, Joshua 6:17;
   Ezra 10:8. It never means excommunication, but cutting off by death.
   Compare Exodus 22:20, and Deuteronomy 13:1-11. It has hence been
   applied to designate a man that is execrable and accursed, deserving
   death. So the Apostle uses it in 1 Corinthians 16:22, and Galatians
   1:8, 9 The other view is more in accordance with the meaning of the
   term. It is thought that "anathema" means an ignominious death, and
   that of one apparently separated from Christ; or that he wished to be
   made "an anathema" by Christ, or for the sake of Christ, or after
   Christ, that is, his example. The words apo tou Christou create all the
   difficulty in this case. This is the explanation given by Jerome,
   Locke, Limborch, Doddridge, and Scott The first meaning, however, as
   materially given by Calvin, is the most obvious and natural. Both
   Haldane and Chalmers follow the Vulgate, and put the clause in a
   parenthesis, as expressing the Apostle's wish when unconverted; but
   there is altogether an incongruity in the terms he employs to express
   this wish; he surely would not have said that he wished to be separated
   from Christ as an accursed thing, for that is the meaning of anathema;
   for while he was a Pharisee he deemed it a privilege and an honour even
   to persecute Christ. And we cannot suppose that the Apostle would now
   describe his former wish in terms unsuitable to what it really was, but
   as he now regarded it. -- Ed.

   [287] Vitriaga thinks that "the glory" was the pillar of fire and the
   cloud in the wilderness: but Beza, Grotius, and Hammond agree with
   Calvin, that the ark is meant. See Psalm 78:61. It seems to refer to
   those manifestations made in the tabernacle, and afterwards in the
   temple, by peculiar brightness or splendour. See Exodus 40:34; and I
   Kings 8:11. This splendour or glory signified God's presence, a
   privilege peculiar to the Israelites. -- Ed.

   [288] Why he mentions "covenants," hai diathokai, in the plural number,
   has been variously accounted for, -- "there were various things
   included -- the land of Canaan, prosperity, and the priesthood, --
   there were three laws -- the moral, ceremonial, and judicial, -- there
   were several repetitions of the covenant made to the patriarchs;" but
   if we read Galatians 3:17, we shall see the true reason, for the
   Apostle there makes a distinct difference between the Abrahamic and the
   Mosaic covenant; but both these belonged to the Jews. See also
   Ephesians 2:12. -- Ed.

   [289] Stuart has in a most convincing manner vindicated the true and
   obvious meaning of this clause. There is no reading of any authority,
   nor any early version, that affects the genuineness of the received
   text: and it is amazing what ingenuity has been exercised by various
   critics to evade the plain construction of the passage, -- a remarkable
   instance of the debasing power of preconceived notions. It is somewhat
   singular too, that some who professed at least the doctrine of Christ's
   divinity, such as Erasmus, Whitby, and Locke, have attempted to make
   changes in the text, and those for the most part conjectural, by which
   the obvious meaning is wholly altered. It is very clearly shown by
   Stuart, that the very position of the words, and their connection with
   the context, will admit of no other construction than that which our
   version contains. It is well known, that in Hebrew the word "blessed"
   is always placed before "God," or Jehovah, when it is an ascription of
   praise; and it appears that the Septuagint has in more than thirty
   instances followed the same order, and, indeed, in every instance
   except one, (Psalm 68:19,) and that evidently a typographical mistake.
   The same is the case with all the examples in the New Testament. So
   that if the phrase here was a doxology, it must have been written
   eulogetos ho Theos. In the Welsh language, which in many of its idioms
   is identically the same with the Hebrew, the order of the words is the
   same: when it is a doxology, the word "blessed" invariably precedes the
   word "God;" and when otherwise it follows it. The opinion of Chrysostom
   on this sentence, to which Erasmus attaches some importance, is of no
   value whatever, as he did not understand Hebrew; and Paul, for the most
   part, wrote as a Hebraist. The participle on, being put for esti, is
   what is common in Hebrew and in the New Testament. See a remarkable
   instance of two participles and a verb in the middle, in Revelation
   1:4. It has been said, that "amen" unsuitably follows a declarative
   sentence; but see an instance in Romans 1:25 It is justly observed by
   Stuart, that the context requires the application of this sentence to
   Christ, as otherwise there would be no antithesis to the words
   "according to the flesh." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 9:6-9

   6. Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are
   not all Israel, which are of Israel:

   6. Neque tamen, quasi exciderit verbum Dei: non emro omnes qui sunt ex
   Israele sunt Israelitae:

   7. Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
   children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

   7. Nec qui sunt semen Abrahae, ideo omnes filii; sed in Isaac vocabitur
   tibi semen:

   8. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the
   children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the
   seed.

   8. Hoc est, non qui sunt filii carnis, ii filii sunt Dei; sed qui sunt
   filii promissionis, censebuntur in semen:

   9. For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara
   shall have a son.

   9. Promissionis enim verbum hoc est, Secundum hoc tempus veniam, et
   erit Sarae filius.

   6. Not however, etc. Paul had been carried away by the ardour of his
   wish, as it were, into an excess of feeling, (in ecstasin,) but now,
   returning to discharge his office as a teacher, he adds what may be
   viewed as somewhat qualifying what he had said, as though he would
   restrain immoderate grief. And inasmuch as by deploring the ruin of his
   own nation, this inconsistency seems to follow, that the covenant made
   by God with the seed of Abraham had failed, (for the favor of God could
   not have been wanting to the Israelites without the covenant being
   abolished,) he reasonably anticipates this inconsistency, and shows,
   that notwithstanding the great blindness of the Jews, the favor of God
   continued still to that people, so that the truth of the covenant
   remained firm.

   Some read, "But it is not possible," etc., as though it were in Greek
   hoion te [290] but as I find this reading in no copy, I adopt the
   common reading, Not however that it had failed, etc., and according to
   this sense, "That I deplore the destruction of my nation is not because
   I think the promise, given formerly by God to Abraham, is now void or
   abolished."

   For not all, etc. The statement is, -- that the promise was so given to
   Abraham and to his seed, that the inheritance did not belong to every
   seed without distinction; it hence follows that the defection of some
   does not prove that the covenant does not remain firm and valid.

   But that it may be more evident on what condition the Lord adopted the
   posterity of Abraham as a peculiar people to himself, two things are to
   be here considered. The first is, That the promise of salvation given
   to Abraham belongs to all who can trace their natural descent to him;
   for it is offered to all without exception, and for this reason they
   are rightly called the heirs of the covenant made with Abraham; and in
   this respect they are his successors, or, as Scripture calls them, the
   children of the promise. For since it was the Lord's will that his
   covenant should be sealed, no less in Ishmael and Esau, than in Isaac
   and Jacob, it appears that they were not wholly alienated from him;
   except, it may be, you make no account of the circumcision, which was
   conferred on them by God's command; but it cannot be so regarded
   without dishonor to God. But this belonged to them, according to what
   the Apostle had said before, "whose are the covenants," though they
   were unbelieving; and in Acts 3:25, they are called by Peter, the
   children of the covenants, because they were the descendants of the
   Prophets. The second point to be considered is, That the children of
   the promise are strictly those in whom its power and effect are found.
   On this account Paul denies here that all the children of Abraham were
   the children of God, though a covenant had been made with them by the
   Lord, for few continued in the faith of the covenant; and yet God
   himself testifies, in the sixth chapter of Ezekiel, that they were all
   regarded by him as children. In short, when a whole people are called
   the heritage and the peculiar people of God, what is meant is, that
   they have been chosen by the Lord, the promise of salvation having been
   offered them and confirmed by the symbol of circumcision; but as many
   by their ingratitude reject this adoption, and thus enjoy in no degree
   its benefits, there arises among them another difference with regard to
   the fulfilment of the promise. That it might not then appear strange to
   any one, that this fulfilment of the promise was not evident in many of
   the Jews, Paul denies that they were included in the true election of
   God.

   Some may prefer such a statement as this, -- "The general election of
   the people of Israel is no hinderance, that God should not from them
   choose by his hidden counsel those whom he pleases." It is indeed an
   illustrious example of gratuitous mercy, when God deigns to make a
   covenant of life with a nation: but his hidden favor appears more
   evident in that second election, which is confined to a part only.

   But when he says, that all who are of Israel are not Israelites, and
   that all who are of the seed of Abraham are not children, it is a kind
   of change in the meaning of words, (paronomasia); for in the first
   clause he includes the whole race, in the second he refers only to true
   sons, who were not become degenerated.

   7. But, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called." Paul mentions this, to
   show that the hidden election of God overrules the outward calling, and
   that it is yet by no means inconsistent with it, but, on the contrary,
   that it tends to its confirmation and completion. That he might then in
   due order prove both, he in the first place assumes, that the election
   of God is not tied to the natural descendants of Abraham, and that it
   is not a thing that is included in the conditions of the covenant: and
   this is what he now confirms by a most suitable example. For if there
   ought to have been any natural progeny, which fell not away from the
   covenant; this ought to have been especially the case with those who
   obtained the privilege at first: but when we find, that of the first
   sons of Abraham, while he was yet alive, and the promise new, one of
   them was separated as the seed, how much more might the same thing have
   taken place in his distant posterity? Now this testimony is taken from
   Genesis 17:20, where the Lord gives an answer to Abraham, that he had
   heard his prayer for Ishmael, but that there would be another on whom
   the promised blessing would rest. It hence follows, that some men are
   by special privilege elected out of the chosen people, in whom the
   common adoption becomes efficacious and valid.

   8. That is, They are not, etc. He now gathers from God's answer a
   proposition, which includes the whole of what he had in view. For if
   Isaac, and not Ishmael, was the seed, though the one as well as the
   other was Abraham's son, it must be that all natural sons are not to be
   regarded as the seed, but that the promise is specially fulfilled only
   in some, and that it does not belong commonly and equally to all. He
   calls those the children of the flesh, who have nothing superior to a
   natural descent; as they are the children of the promise, who are
   peculiarly selected by the Lord.

   9. For the word of promise is this, etc. He adds another divine
   testimony; and we see, by the application made of it, with what care
   and skill he explains Scripture. When he says, the Lord said that he
   would come, and that a son would be born to Abraham of Sarah, he
   intimated that his blessing was not yet conferred, but that it was as
   yet suspended. [291] But Ishmael was already born when this was said:
   then God's blessing had no regard to Ishmael. We may also observe, by
   the way, the great caution with which he proceeds here, lest he should
   exasperate the Jews. The cause being passed over, he first simply
   states the fact; he will hereafter open the fountain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [290] Were this the case, the verb which follows, as Wolfius says and
   proves by an example, must have been in the infinitive mood. Piscator
   says the same. But Pareus and Beza take this to be the meaning; and so
   does Macknight, "Now it is not possible that the promise of God hath
   fallen." -- Ed.

   [291] Genesis 18:10. The quotation is not from the Septuagint, but is
   much nearer a literal version of the Hebrew: the only material
   difference is in the words, "at this time," instead of "according to
   the time of life." The words in different forms occur four times, --
   Genesis 17:21; Genesis 18:10,14; Genesis 21:2; we meet with the same
   words in 2 Kings 4:16,17. It appears that the Apostle here took this
   expression, "at this time," from Genesis 17:21, while he mainly
   followed the text in Genesis 18:10. The meaning of the phrase,
   "according to the time of life," as given in Genesis and in Kings,
   evidently is the time of child-bearing, what passes between conception
   and the birth. This was repeatedly mentioned in order to show that the
   usual course of nature would be followed, though the conception would
   be miraculous; the child to be born was to be nourished the usual time
   in the womb, -- "according to the time of producing life," or of
   child-bearing. The exposition of Gesenius, adopted by Tholuck and
   Stuart, "when the time shall be renewed," does not comport with the
   passage, as it introduces a tautology. Hammond says, that the Hebrews
   interpret the expression in Kings as meaning the time between the
   conception and the birth. -- Ed.

   Romans 9:10-13

   10. And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even
   by our father Isaac;

   10. Non solum autem hic, sed et Rebecca, quae ex uno conceperat, patre
   nostro Isaac:

   11. (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good
   or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not
   of works, but of him that calleth;)

   11. Quum enim nondum nati essent pueri, nec quidpiam boni aut mali
   egissent, ut secundum electio-nem propositum Dei maneret,

   12. It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

   12. Non ex operibus, sed ex vocante, dictum est ei, Major serviet
   minori;

   13. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

   13. Quemadmodum scriptum est, Jacob dilexi, Esau autem odio habui.

   10. And not only, etc. There are in this chapter some broken sentences,
   such as this is, -- But Rebecca also, who had conceived by one, our
   father Isaac; for he leaves off in the middle, before he comes to the
   principal verb. The meaning, however, is, that the difference as to the
   possession of the promise may not only be seen in the children of
   Abraham, but that there is a much more evident example in Jacob and
   Esau: for in the former instance some might allege that their condition
   was unequal, the one being the son of an handmaid; but these were of
   the same mother, and were even twins: yet one was rejected, and the
   other was chosen by the Lord. It is hence clear, that the fulfilment of
   the promise does not take place in all the children of the flesh
   indiscriminately.

   And as Paul refers to the persons to whom God made known his purpose, I
   prefer to regard a masculine pronoun to be understood, rather than a
   neuter, as Erasmus has done: for the meaning is, that God's special
   election had not been revealed only to Abraham, but also to Rebecca,
   when she brought forth her twins. [292]

   11. For when the children, etc. He now begins to ascend higher, even to
   show the cause of this difference, which he teaches us is nowhere else
   to be found except in the election of God. He had indeed before briefly
   noticed, that there was a difference between the natural children of
   Abraham, that though all were adopted by circumcision into a
   participation of the covenant, yet the grace of God was not effectual
   in them all; and hence that they, who enjoy the favor of God, are the
   children of the promise. But how it thus happened, he has been either
   silent or has obscurely hinted. Now indeed he openly ascribes the whole
   cause to the election of God, and that gratuitous, and in no way
   depending on men; so that in the salvation of the godly nothing higher
   (nihil superius) must be sought than the goodness of God, and nothing
   higher in the perdition of the reprobate than his just severity.

   Then the first proposition is, -- "As the blessing of the covenant
   separates the Israelitic nation from all other people, so the election
   of God makes a distinction between men in that nation, while he
   predestinates some to salvation, and others to eternal condemnation."
   The second proposition is, -- "There is no other basis for this
   election than the goodness of God alone, and also since the fall of
   Adam, his mercy; which embraces whom he pleases, without any regard
   whatever to their works." The third is, -- "The Lord in his gratuitous
   election is free and exempt from the necessity of imparting equally the
   same grace to all; but, on the contrary, he passes by whom he wills,
   and whom he wills he chooses." All these things Paul briefly includes
   in one sentence: he then goes on to other things.

   Moreover, by these words, When the children had not yet been born, nor
   had done any good or evil, he shows, that God in making a difference
   could not have had any regard to works, for they were not yet done. Now
   they who argue on the other side, and say, that this is no reason why
   the election of God should not make a difference between men according
   to the merits of works, for God foresees who those are who by future
   works would be worthy or unworthy of his grace, are not more
   clear-sighted than Paul, but stumble at a principle in theology, which
   ought to be well known to all Christians, namely, that God can see
   nothing in the corrupt nature of man, such as was in Esau and Jacob, to
   induce him to manifest his favor. When therefore he says, that neither
   of them had then done any good or evil, what he took as granted must
   also be added, -- that they were both the children of Adam, by nature
   sinful, and endued with no particle of righteousness.

   I do not dwell thus long on explaining these things, because the
   meaning of the Apostle is obscure; but as the Sophists, being not
   content with his plain sense, endeavour to evade it by frivolous
   distinctions, I wished to show, that Paul was by no means ignorant of
   those things which they allege.

   It may further be said, that though that corruption alone, which is
   diffused through the whole race of man, is sufficient, before it breaks
   out, as they say, into action, for condemnation, and hence it follows,
   that Esau was justly rejected, for he was naturally a child of wrath,
   it was yet necessary, lest any doubt should remain, as though his
   condition became worse through any vice or fault, that sins no less
   than virtues should be excluded. It is indeed true, that the proximate
   cause of reprobation is the curse we all inherit from Adam; yet, that
   we may learn to acquiesce in the bare and simple good pleasure of God,
   Paul withdraws us from this view, until he has established this
   doctrine, -- That God has a sufficiently just reason for electing and
   for reprobating, in his own will. [293]

   That the purpose of God according to election, etc. He speaks of the
   gratuitous election of God almost in every instance. If works had any
   place, he ought to have said, -- "That his reward might stand through
   works;" but he mentions the purpose of God, which is included, so to
   speak, in his own good pleasure alone. And that no ground of dispute
   might remain on the subject, he has removed all doubt by adding another
   clause, according to election, and then a third, not through works, but
   through him who calls. Let us now then apply our minds more closely to
   this passage: Since the purpose of God according to election is
   established in this way, -- that before the brothers were born, and had
   done either good or evil, one was rejected and the other chosen; it
   hence follows, that when any one ascribes the cause of the difference
   to their works, he thereby subverts the purpose of God. Now, by adding,
   not through works, but through him who calls, he means, not on account
   of works, but of the calling only; for he wishes to exclude works
   altogether. We have then the whole stability of our election inclosed
   in the purpose of God alone: here merits avail nothing, as they issue
   in nothing but death; no worthiness is regarded, for there is none; but
   the goodness of God reigns alone. False then is the dogma, and contrary
   to God's word, -- that God elects or rejects, as he foresees each to be
   worthy or unworthy of his favor. [294]

   12. The elder shall serve the younger See how the Lord makes a
   difference between the sons of Isaac, while they were as yet in their
   mother's womb; for this was the heavenly answer, by which it appeared
   that God designed to show to the younger peculiar favor, which he
   denied to the elder. Though this indeed had reference to the right of
   primogeniture, yet in this, as the symbol of something greater, was
   manifested the will of God: and that this was the case we may easily
   perceive, when we consider what little benefit, according to the flesh,
   Jacob derived from his primogeniture. For he was, on its account,
   exposed to great danger; and to avoid this danger, he was obliged to
   quit his home and his country, and was unkindly treated in his exile:
   when he returned, he tremblingly, and in doubt of his life, prostrated
   himself at the feet of his brother, humbly asked forgiveness for his
   offence, and lived through the indulgence shown to him. Where was his
   dominion over his brother, from whom he was constrained to seek by
   entreaty his life? There was then something greater than the
   primogeniture promised in the answer given by the Lord.

   13. As it is written, Jacob I loved, etc. He confirms, by a still
   stronger testimony, how much the heavenly answer, given to Rebecca,
   availed to his present purpose, that is, that the spiritual condition
   of both was intimated by the dominion of Jacob and servitude of Esau,
   and also that Jacob obtained this favor through the kindness of God,
   and not through his own merit. Then this testimony of the prophet shows
   the reason why the Lord conferred on Jacob the primogeniture: and it is
   taken from the first chapter of Malachi, where the Lord, reproaching
   the Jews for their ingratitude, mentions his former kindness to them,
   -- "I have loved you," he says; and then he refers to the origin of his
   love, -- "Was not Esau the brother of Jacob?" as though he said, --
   "What privilege had he, that I should prefer him to his brother? None
   whatever. It was indeed an equal right, except that by the law of
   nature the younger ought to have served the elder; I yet chose the one,
   and rejected the other; and I was thus led by my mercy alone, and by no
   worthiness as to works. I therefore chose you for my people, that I
   might show the same kindness to the seed of Jacob; but I rejected the
   Edomites, the progeny of Esau. Ye are then so much the worse, inasmuch
   as the remembrance of so great a favor cannot stimulate you to adore my
   majesty." [295] Now, though earthly blessings are there recorded, which
   God had conferred on the Israelites, it is not yet right to view them
   but as symbols of his benevolence: for where the wrath of God is, there
   death follows; but where his love is, there is life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [292] Here is a striking instance of a difficulty as to the
   construction, while the meaning of the whole passage is quite evident.
   The ellipsis has been variously supplied; "and not only this," i.e.,
   what I have stated; "and not only he," i.e., Abraham to whom the first
   communication was made; "and not only she," i.e., Sarah, mentioned in
   the preceding verse; "but Rebecca also is another instance." But it may
   be thus supplied, -- "and not only so," i.e., as to the word of
   promise; "but Rebecca also had a word," or a message conveyed to her.
   That the verse has a distinct meaning in itself is evident, for the
   next begins with a gar, "for;" and to include Romans 9:11, in a
   parenthesis, seems by no means satisfactory. The three verses may be
   thus rendered, -- 10. And not only so, but Rebecca also received a
   message, when she conceived by the first, (i.e., son or seed,) even our
   father Isaac: 11. for they being not yet born, and having not done any
   good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might
   stand, not 12. through works, but through him who calls, it was said to
   her, "The elder shall serve the younger." The words ex henos, rendered
   commonly "by one," have never been satisfactorily accounted for. It.
   seems to be an instance of Hebraism; the word 'chd, "one," means also
   "first." We have other instances of this in the New Testament; eis mian
   ton sabbaton -- "on the first (i.e., day) of the week," Matthew 28:1;
   see also Mark 16:2; John 20:19. "The first day" in Genesis 1:5, is
   rendered by the Septuagint, hemera mia. Isaac was the first son or seed
   of promise: and a difference was made in the children of the very first
   seed. But this meaning of eis is said by Schleusner to be sanctioned by
   Greek writers, such as Herodotus and Thucydides There is no necessity
   of introducing the word "children," at the beginning of Romans 9:11;
   the antecedent in this case, as it sometimes happens, comes after the
   pronoun; and it is the "elder" and "younger" at the end of Romans 9:12.
   -- Ed.

   [293] Archbishop Usher asks this question, "Did God, before he made
   man, determine to save some and reject others?" To this he gives this
   answer, -- "Yes, surely; before they had done either good or evil, God
   in his eternal counsel set them apart." It is the same sentiment that
   is announced here by Calvin But to deduce it from what is said of Jacob
   and Esau, does not seem legitimate, inasmuch as they were in a fallen
   condition by nature, and the reference is evidently made to anything
   done personally by themselves. Election and reprobation most clearly
   presuppose man as fallen and lost: it is hence indeed, that the words
   derive their meaning. That it was God's eternal purpose to choose some
   of man's fallen race, and to leave others to perish, is clearly taught
   us: but this is a different question from the one touched upon here, --
   that this purpose was irrespective of man's fall, -- a sentiment which,
   as far as I can see, is not recognised nor taught in Scripture. And not
   only Calvin, but many other divines, both before and after him, seem to
   have gone in this respect somewhat beyond the limits of revelation; it
   is true, by a process of reasoning apparently obvious; but when we
   begin to reason on this high and mysterious subject, we become soon
   bewildered and lost in mazes of difficulties. -- Ed.

   [294] Nothing can be conceived more conclusive in argument than what is
   contained here. The idea of foreseen works, as the reason or the ground
   of election, is wholly excluded. The choice is expressly denied to be
   on account of any works, and is as expressly ascribed to the sovereign
   will of God. "He does not oppose works to faith, but to him who calls,
   or to the calling, which precedes faith, that is, to that calling which
   is according to God's purpose. Paul means, that the difference between
   Jacob and Esau was made through the sole will and pleasure of God, not
   through their wills or works, existing or foreseen." -- Poli. Syn. Yet
   some of the Fathers, as Chrysostom and Theodoret, as well as some
   modern divines, ascribe election to foreseen works. How this is
   reconcilable with the argument of the Apostle, and with the instances
   he adduces, it is indeed a very hard matter to see. One way by which
   the Apostle's argument is evaded, is, that the election here is to
   temporal and outward privileges. Be it so: let this be granted; but it
   is adduced by the Apostle as an illustration -- and of what? most
   clearly of spiritual and eternal election. He refers both to the same
   principle, to the free choice of God, and not to anything in man. "God
   foresaw the disposition of each." -- Theodoret and Chrysostom "His
   election corresponds with the foreseen disposition of men." --
   Theodoret "It was done by the prescience of God, whereby he knew while
   yet unborn, what each would be." -- Augustine These are quotations made
   by a modern writer (Bosanquet) with approbation: but surely nothing
   could be suggested more directly contrary to the statements and the
   argument of the Apostle. There is a mistake, I apprehend, as to the
   last quotation; perhaps similar to that made in quoting Augustine on
   the latter part of the 7th chapter of this Epistle, where the writer
   quotes a sentiment of Augustine, which he afterwards retracted, a thing
   which has been often done by the advocates of Popery, but by no means
   becoming a Protestant. -- Ed.

   [295] The meaning of the words "loving" and "hating" is here rightly
   explained. It is usual in Scripture to state a preference in terms like
   these. See Genesis 29:31; Luke 14:26; John 12:25 -- Ed.

   Romans 9:14-18

   14. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
   forbid.

   14. Quid ergo dicemus? num injustitia est apud Deum? Absit:

   15. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
   and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

   15. Moses enim dicit, Miserebor cujus miserebor, et miserebor quem
   miseratus fuero.

   16. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but
   of God that sheweth mercy.

   16. Ergo non volentis neque currentis, sed miserentis est Dei.

   17. For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
   have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my
   name might be declared throughout all the earth.

   17. Dieit enim Scriptura Pharaoni, In hoc ipsum excitavite, ut ostendam
   in te potentiam meam, et ut praedicetur nomen meum in universa terra.

   18. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
   will he hardeneth.

   18. Ergo cujus vult miseretur, et quem vult indurat.

   14. What then shall we say? etc. The flesh cannot hear of this wisdom
   of God without being instantly disturbed by numberless questions, and
   without attempting in a manner to call God to an account. We hence find
   that the Apostle, whenever he treats of some high mystery, obviates the
   many absurdities by which he knew the minds of men would be otherwise
   possessed; for when men hear anything of what Scripture teaches
   respecting predestination, they are especially entangled with very many
   impediments.

   The predestination of God is indeed in reality a labyrinth, from which
   the mind of man can by no means extricate itself: but so unreasonable
   is the curiosity of man, that the more perilous the examination of a
   subject is, the more boldly he proceeds; so that when predestination is
   discussed, as he cannot restrain himself within due limits, he
   immediately, through his rashness, plunges himself, as it were, into
   the depth of the sea. What remedy then is there for the godly? Must
   they avoid every thought of predestination? By no means: for as the
   Holy Spirit has taught us nothing but what it behoves us to know, the
   knowledge of this would no doubt be useful, provided it be confined to
   the word of God. Let this then be our sacred rule, to seek to know
   nothing concerning it, except what Scripture teaches us: when the Lord
   closes his holy mouth, let us also stop the way, that we may not go
   farther. But as we are men, to whom foolish questions naturally occur,
   let us hear from Paul how they are to be met.

   Is there unrighteousness with God? Monstrous surely is the madness of
   the human mind, that it is more disposed to charge God with
   unrighteousness than to blame itself for blindness. Paul indeed had no
   wish to go out of his way to find out things by which he might confound
   his readers; but he took up as it were from what was common the wicked
   suggestion, which immediately enters the minds of many, when they hear
   that God determines respecting every individual according to his own
   will. It is indeed, as the flesh imagines, a kind of injustice, that
   God should pass by one and show regard to another.

   In order to remove this difficulty, Paul divides his subject into two
   parts; in the, former of which he speaks of the elect, and in the
   latter of the reprobate; and in the one he would have us to contemplate
   the mercy of God, and in the other to acknowledge his righteous
   judgment. His first reply is, that the thought that there is injustice
   with God deserves to be abhorred, and then he shows that with regard to
   the two parties, there can be none.

   But before we proceed further, we may observe that this very objection
   clearly proves, that inasmuch as God elects some and passes by others,
   the cause is not to be found in anything else but in his own purpose;
   for if the difference had been based on works, Paul would have to no
   purpose mentioned this question respecting the unrighteousness of God,
   no suspicion could have been entertained concerning it if God dealt
   with every one according to his merit. It may also, in the second
   place, be noticed, that though he saw that this doctrine could not be
   touched without exciting instant clamours and dreadful blasphemies, he
   yet freely and openly brought it forward; nay, he does not conceal how
   much occasion for murmuring and clamour is given to us, when we hear
   that before men are born their lot is assigned to each by the secret
   will of God; and yet, notwithstanding all this, he proceeds, and
   without any subterfuges, declares what he had learned from the Holy
   Spirit. It hence follows, that their fancies are by no means to be
   endured, who aim to appear wiser than the Holy Spirit, in removing and
   pacifying offences. That they may not criminate God, they ought
   honestly to confess that the salvation or the perdition of men depends
   on his free election. Were they to restrain their minds from unholy
   curiosity, and to bridle their tongues from immoderate liberty, their
   modesty and sobriety would be deserving of approbation; but to put a
   restraint on the Holy Spirit and on Paul, what audacity it is! Let then
   such magnanimity ever prevail in the Church of God, as that godly
   teachers may not be ashamed to make an honest profession of the true
   doctrine, however hated it may be, and also to refute whatever
   calumnies the ungodly may bring forward.

   15. For he saith to Moses, etc. [296] With regard to the elect, God
   cannot be charged with any unrighteousness; for according to his good
   pleasure he favors them with mercy: and yet even in this case the flesh
   finds reasons for murmuring, for it cannot concede to God the right of
   showing favor to one and not to another, except the cause be made
   evident. As then it seems unreasonable that some should without merit
   be preferred to others, the petulancy of men quarrels with God, as
   though he deferred to persons more than what is right. Let us now see
   how Paul defends the righteousness of God.

   In the first place, he does by no means conceal or hide what he saw
   would be disliked, but proceeds to maintain it with inflexible
   firmness. And in the second place, he labours not to seek out reasons
   to soften its asperity, but considers it enough to check vile barkings
   by the testimonies of Scripture.

   It may indeed appear a frigid defence that God is not unjust, because
   he is merciful to whom he pleases; but as God regards his own authority
   alone as abundantly sufficient, so that he needs the defence of none,
   Paul thought it enough to appoint him the vindicator of his own right.
   Now Paul brings forward here the answer which Moses received from the
   Lord, when he prayed for the salvation of the whole people, "I will
   show mercy," was God's answer, "on whom I will show mercy, and I will
   have compassion on whom I will have compassion." By this oracle the
   Lord declared that he is a debtor to none of mankind, and that whatever
   he gives is a gratuitous benefit, and then that his kindness is free,
   so that he can confer it on whom he pleases; and lastly, that no cause
   higher than his own will can be thought of, why he does good and shows
   favor to some men but not to all. The words indeed mean as much as
   though he had said, "From him to whom I have once purposed to show
   mercy, I will never take it away; and with perpetual kindness will I
   follow him to whom I have determined to be kind." And thus he assigns
   the highest reason for imparting grace, even his own voluntary purpose,
   and also intimates that he has designed his mercy peculiarly for some;
   for it is a way of speaking which excludes all outward causes, as when
   we claim to ourselves the free power of acting, we say, "I will do what
   I mean to do." The relative pronoun also expressly intimates, that
   mercy is not to all indiscriminately. His freedom is taken away from
   God, when his election is bound to external causes.

   The only true cause of salvation is expressed in the two words used by
   Moses. The first is chnn, chenen, which means to favor or to show
   kindness freely and bountifully; the other is rchm, rechem, which is to
   be treated with mercy. Thus is confirmed what Paul intended, that the
   mercy of God, being gratuitous, is under no restraint, but turns
   wherever it pleases. [297]

   16. It is not then of him who wills, etc. From the testimony adduced he
   draws this inference, that beyond all controversy our election is not
   to be ascribed to our diligence, nor to our striving, nor to our
   efforts, but that it is wholly to be referred to the counsel of God.
   That none of you may think that they who are elected are elected
   because they are deserving, or because they had in any way procured for
   themselves the favor of God, or, in short, because they had in them a
   particle of worthiness by which God might be moved, take simply this
   view of the matter, that it is neither by our will nor efforts, (for he
   has put running for striving or endeavour,) that we are counted among
   the elect, but that it wholly depends on the divine goodness, which of
   itself chooses those who neither will, nor strive, nor even think of
   such a thing. And they who reason from this passage, that there is in
   us some power to strive, but that it effects nothing of itself unless
   assisted by God's mercy, maintain what is absurd; for the Apostle shows
   not what is in us, but excludes all our efforts. It is therefore a mere
   sophistry to say that we will and run, because Paul denies that it is
   of him who wills or runs, since he meant nothing else than that neither
   willing nor running can do anything.

   They are, however, to be condemned who remain secure and idle on the
   pretence of giving place to the grace of God; for though nothing is
   done by their own striving, yet that effort which is influenced by God
   is not ineffectual. These things, then, are not said that we may quench
   the Spirit of God, while kindling sparks within us, by our waywardness
   and sloth; but that we may understand that everything we have is from
   him, and that we may hence learn to ask all things of him, to hope for
   all things from him, and to ascribe all things to him, while we are
   prosecuting the work of our salvation with fear and trembling.

   Pelagius has attempted by another sophistical and worthless cavil to
   evade this declaration of Paul, that it is not only of him who wills
   and runs, because the mercy of God assists. But Augustine, not less
   solidly than acutely, thus refuted him, "If the will of man is denied
   to be the cause of election, because it is not the sole cause, but only
   in part; so also we may say that it is not of mercy but of him who
   wills and runs, for where there is a mutual cooperation, there ought to
   be a reciprocal commendation: but unquestionably the latter sentiment
   falls through its own absurdity." Let us then feel assured that the
   salvation of those whom God is pleased to save, is thus ascribed to his
   mercy, that nothing may remain to the contrivance of man. [298]

   Nor is there much more colour for what some advance, who think that
   these things are said in the person of the ungodly; for how can it be
   right to turn passages of Scripture in which the justice of God is
   asserted, for the purpose of reproaching him with tyranny? and then is
   it probable that Paul, when the refutation was at hand and easy, would
   have suffered the Scripture to be treated with gross mockery? But such
   subterfuges have they laid hold on, who absurdly measured this
   incomparable mystery of God by their own judgment. To their delicate
   and tender ears this doctrine was more grating than that they could
   think it worthy of an Apostle. But they ought rather to have bent their
   own stubbornness to the obedience of the Spirit, that they might not
   surrender themselves up to their gross inventions.

   17. For the Scripture saith, etc. He comes now to the second part, the
   rejection of the ungodly, and as there seems to be something more
   unreasonable in this, he endeavours to make it more fully evident, how
   God, in rejecting whom he wills, is not only irreprehensible, but also
   wonderful in his wisdom and justice. He then takes his proof from
   Exodus 9:16, where the Lord declares that it was he who raised up
   Pharaoh for this end, that while he obstinately strove to resist the
   power of God, he might, by being overcome and subdued, afford a proof
   how invincible the arm of God is; to bear which, much less to resist
   it, no human power is able. See then the example which the Lord
   designed to exhibit in Pharaoh! [299]

   There are here two things to be considered, -- the predestination of
   Pharaoh to ruin, which is to be referred to the past and yet the hidden
   counsel of God, -- and then, the design of this, which was to make
   known the name of God; and on this does Paul primarily dwell: for if
   this hardening was of such a kind, that on its account the name of God
   deserved to be made known, it is an impious thing, according to
   evidence derived from the contrary effect, to charge him with any
   unrighteousness.

   But as many interpreters, striving to modify this passage, pervert it,
   we must first observe, that for the word, "I have raised," or stirred
   up, (excitavi,) the Hebrew is, "I have appointed," (constitui,) by
   which it appears, that God, designing to show, that the contumacy of
   Pharaoh would not prevent him to deliver his people, not only affirms,
   that his fury had been foreseen by him, and that he had prepared means
   for restraining it, but that he had also thus designedly ordained it,
   and indeed for this end, -- that he might exhibit a more illustrious
   evidence of his own power. [300] Absurdly then do some render this
   passage, -- that Pharaoh was preserved for a time; for his beginning is
   what is spoken of here. For, seeing many things from various quarters
   happen to men, which retard their purposes and impede the course of
   their actions, God says, that Pharaoh proceeded from him, and that his
   condition was by himself assigned to him: and with this view agrees the
   verb, I have raised up. But that no one may imagine, that Pharaoh was
   moved from above by some kind of common and indiscriminate impulse, to
   rush headlong into that madness, the special cause, or end, is
   mentioned; as though it had been said, -- that God not only knew what
   Pharaoh would do, but also designedly ordained him for this purpose. It
   hence follows, that it is in vain to contend with him, as though he
   were bound to give a reason; for he of himself comes forth before us,
   and anticipates the objection, by declaring, that the reprobate,
   through whom he designs his name to be made known, proceed from the
   hidden fountain of his providence.

   18. To whom he wills then he showeth mercy, etc. Here follows the
   conclusion of both parts; which can by no means be understood as being
   the language of any other but of the Apostle; for he immediately
   addresses an opponent, and adduces what might have been objected by an
   opposite party. There is therefore no doubt but that Paul, as we have
   already reminded you, speaks these things in his own person, namely,
   that God, according to his own will, favors with mercy them whom he
   pleases, and unsheathes the severity of his judgment against whomsoever
   it seemeth him good. That our mind may be satisfied with the difference
   which exists between the elect and the reprobate, and may not inquire
   for any cause higher than the divine will, his purpose was to convince
   us of this -- that it seems good to God to illuminate some that they
   may be saved, and to blind others that they may perish: for we ought
   particularly to notice these words, to whom he wills, and, whom he
   wills: beyond this he allows us not to proceed.

   But the word hardens, when applied to God in Scripture, means not only
   permission, (as some washy moderators would have it,) but also the
   operation of the wrath of God: for all those external things, which
   lead to the blinding of the reprobate, are the instruments of his
   wrath; and Satan himself, who works inwardly with great power, is so
   far his minister, that he acts not, but by his command. [301] Then that
   frivolous evasion, which the schoolmen have recourse to respecting
   foreknowledge, falls to the ground: for Paul teaches us, that the ruin
   of the wicked is not only foreseen by the Lord, but also ordained by
   his counsel and his will; and Solomon teaches as the same thing, --
   that not only the destruction of the wicked is foreknown, but that the
   wicked themselves have been created for this very end -- that they may
   perish. (Proverbs 16:4.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [296] The quotation is from Exodus 33:19, and literally from the
   Septuagint. The verb eleeo is to be taken here in the sense of showing
   favour rather than mercy, according to the meaning of the Hebrew word;
   for the idea of mercy is what the other verb, oikteiro, conveys.
   Schleusner renders it here and in some other passages in this sense.
   The rendering then would be -- "I will favour whom I favour," that is,
   whom I choose to favour; "and I will pity whom I pity," which means
   whom I choose to pity. The latter verb in both clauses is in Hebrew in
   the future tense, but rendered properly in Greek in the present, as it
   commonly expresses a present act. -- Ed.

   [297] These two words clearly show that election regards man as fallen;
   for favour is what is shown to the undeserving, and mercy to the
   wretched and miserable, so that the choice that is made is out of the
   corrupted mass of mankind, contemplated in that state, and not as in a
   state of innocency. Augustine says, "Deus alios facit vasa irae
   secundum meritus; alios vasa miserieordiae secundum gratiam -- God
   makes some vessels of wrath according to their merit; others vessels of
   mercy according to his grace." In another place he says, "Deus ex eadem
   massa damnata originaliter, tanquam figulus, fecit aliud vas ad
   honorem, aliud in contumeliam -- God, as a potter, made of the same
   originally condemned mass, one vessel to honor, another to dishonor."
   "Two sorts of vessels God forms out of the great lump of fallen
   mankind." -- Henry

   [298] The terms "willing" and "running" are evidently derived from the
   circumstances connected with the history of Esau. "In vain," says
   Turrettin, "did Esau seek the blessing. In vain did Isaac hasten to
   grant it, and in vain did Esau run to procure venison for his father;
   neither the father's willingness nor the running of the son availed
   anything; God's favour overruled the whole." But the subject handled is
   God's sovereignty in the manifestation of his favour and grace. Esau
   was but a type of the unbelieving Jews, when the gospel was proclaimed,
   and of thousands of such as are in name Christians. There is some sort
   of "willing," and a great deal of "running," and yet the blessing is
   not attained. There was much of apparent willing, and running in the
   strict formality and zeal of Pharisaism, and there is much of the same
   kind still in the austerities and mechanical worship of superstition,
   and also in the toils and devotions of self-righteousness. The word or
   the revealed will of God is in all these instances misunderstood and
   neglected. Isaac's "willingness" to give the blessing to Esau,
   notwithstanding the announcement made at his birth, and Rebecca's
   conduct in securing it to Jacob, are singular instances of man's
   imperfections, and of the overruling power of God. Isaac acted as
   though he had forgotten what God had expressed as his will; and Rebecca
   acted as though God could not effect his purpose without her
   interference, and an interference, too, in a way highly improper and
   sinful. It was the trial of faith, and the faith of both halted
   exceedingly; yet the purpose of God was still fulfilled, but the
   improper manner in which it was fulfilled was afterwards visited with
   God's displeasure. -- Ed.

   [299] "For," at the beginning of this verse, connects it with Romans
   9:14; it is the second reason given for what that verse contains: this
   is in accordance with Paul's manner of writing, and it may be rendered
   here, moreover, or besides, or farther. Macknight renders it "besides."
   Were gar rendered thus in many instances, the meaning would be much
   more evident. -- Ed.

   [300] It is somewhat remarkable, that Paul, in quoting this passage,
   Exodus 9:16, substitutes a clause for the first that is given by the
   Septuagint: instead of "heneken touto dieterethes on this account thou
   hast been preserved," he gives, "eis auto touto exegeira se -- for this
   very end have I raised thee." The Hebrew is, "And indeed for this end
   have I made thee to stand, hmdtyk" The verb used by Paul is found only
   in one other place in the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 6:14; where it
   refers to the resurrection. In the Septuagint it often occurs, but
   never, as Stuart tells us, in the sense of creating, or bringing into
   existence, but in that of exciting, rousing from sleep, or rendering
   active. References are made to Genesis 28:16; Judges 5:12; Psalm 7:7;
   Jeremiah 50:41; Joel 3:9, etc. Hence it is by him rendered here, "I
   have roused thee up." But to make the Hebrew verb to bear this sense is
   by no means easy: the three places referred to, Nehemiah 6:7, and
   Daniel 11:11 and 13, do not seem to afford a satisfactory proof. Psalm
   107:25, is more to the point. Its first meaning is, to make to stand,
   and then, to present persons, Numbers 13:6, -- -to establish or make
   strong a kingdom or a city, 1 Kings 15:4, -- to fix persons in office,
   2 Chronicles 35:2, -- to set up or build a house, Ezra 9:9, -- to
   appoint teachers, Nehemiah 6:7, -- and to arrange or set in order an
   army, Daniel 11:13. Such are the ideas included in this verb. "I have
   made thee to stand," established, or made thee strong, may be its
   meaning in this passage. To establish or to make one strong, is more
   than to preserve, the word used by the Septuagint: and hence it was, it
   may be, that Paul adopted another word, which conveys the idea, that
   Pharaoh had been elevated into greater power than his predecessors,
   which the Hebrew verb seems to imply. Venema, as well as Stuart,
   thought that the idea of exciting, rousing in to action, or
   stimulating, is to be ascribed to the verbs here used, and that what is
   meant is, that God by his plagues awakened and excited all the evil
   that was in Pharaoh's heart for the purposes here described, and that
   by this process he "hardened" him; and the conclusion of Romans 9:28
   seems to favour this view, for the hardening mentioned there can have
   no reference to anything in the context except to what is said in this
   verse. But the simpler view is that mentioned by Wolfius -- that
   reference is made to the dangers which Pharaoh had already escaped. God
   says, "I have made thee to stand," i.e., to remain alive in the midst
   of them. We hence see the reason why Paul changed the verb; for
   "preserve," used by the Septuagint, did not fully express the meaning;
   but to "raise up," as it were from the jaws of death, conveys more
   fully what is meant by the original. -- Ed.

   [301] Much has been unnecessarily written on this subject of hardening.
   Pharaoh is several times said to have hardened his own heart, and God
   is said also several times to have hardened him too. The Scripture in
   many instances makes no minute distinctions, for these may be easily
   gathered from the general tenor of its teaching. God is in his nature
   holy, and therefore hardening as his act cannot be sinful: and as he is
   holy, he hates sin and punishes it; and for this purpose he employs
   wicked men, and even Satan himself, as in the case of Ahab. As a
   punishment, he affords occasions and opportunities to the obstinate
   even to increase their sins, and thus in an indirect way hardens them
   in their rebellion and resistance to his will; and this was exactly the
   case with Pharaoh. This, as Calvin says, was the operation or working
   of his wrath. The history of Pharaoh is a sufficient explanation of
   what is said here. He was a cruel tyrant and oppressor; and God in his
   first message to Moses said, "I am sure that the king of Egypt will not
   let you go, no, not by a mighty hand." God might indeed have softened
   his heart and disposed him to allow them to depart: but it pleased him
   to act otherwise, and to manifest his power and his greatness in
   another way: so that "whom he wills, he favours, and whom he wills, he
   hardens;" and for reasons known only to himself. Reference is at the
   end of this section made to Proverbs 16:4. The creation mentioned can
   be understood in no other sense than the continued exercise of divine
   power in bringing into existence human beings in their present fallen
   state. But "creation" is not the word used, nor is the passage
   correctly rendered. It is not vr' nor sh, but phl; and it is not a verb
   but a substantive. Literally rendered the passage is the following --
   Every work of Jehovah is for its (or, his) purpose,
   And even the wicked is for the day of calamity. The Rev. G. Holden is
   very indignant that this text has been applied to support the doctrine
   of reprobation. Be it, that it has been misapplied; yet the doctrine
   does not thereby fall to the ground. If Paul does not maintain it in
   this chapter and in other passages, we must hold that words have no
   meaning. The history of God's providence is an obvious confirmation of
   the same awful truth. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 9:19-21

   19. Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who
   hath resisted his will?

   19. Dices itaque mihi, Quid adhuc conqueritur? voluntati ejus quis
   restitit?

   20. Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the
   thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?

   20. Atqui, O homo, tu quis es qui contendis judicio cum Deo! hum dicit
   fictile figulo, cur me sic fecisti?

   21. Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make
   one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

   21. An non habet potestatem figulus luti ex eadem massa, faciendi,
   aliud quidem vas in honorem, aliud in contumeliam?

   19. Thou wilt then say, etc. Here indeed the flesh especially storms,
   that is, when it hears that they who perish have been destined by the
   will of God to destruction. Hence the Apostle adopts again the words of
   an opponent; for he saw that the mouths of the ungodly could not be
   restrained from boldly clamouring against the righteousness of God: and
   he very fitly expresses their mind; for being not content with
   defending themselves, they make God guilty instead of themselves; and
   then, after having devolved on him the blame of their own condemnation,
   they become indignant against his great power. [302] They are indeed
   constrained to yield; but they storm, because they cannot resist; and
   ascribing dominion to him, they in a manner charge him with tyranny. In
   the same manner the Sophists in their schools foolishly dispute on what
   they call his absolute justice, as though forgetful of his own
   righteousness, he would try the power of his authority by throwing all
   things into confusion. Thus then speak the ungodly in this passage, --
   "What cause has he to be angry with us? Since he has formed us such as
   we are, since he leads us at his will where he pleases, what else does
   he in destroying us but punish his own work in us? For it is not in our
   power to contend with him; how much soever we may resist, he will yet
   have the upper hand. Then unjust will be his judgment, if he condemns
   us; and unrestrainable is the power which he now employs towards us."
   What does Paul say to these things?

   20. But, O man! who art thou? etc. [303] As it is a participle in
   Greek, we may read what follows in the present tense, who disputest, or
   contendest, or strivest in opposition to God; for it is expressed in
   Greek according to this meaning, -- "Who art thou who enterest into a
   dispute with God?" But there is not much difference in the sense. [304]
   In this first answer, he does nothing else but beat down impious
   blasphemy by an argument taken from the condition of man: he will
   presently subjoin another, by which he will clear the righteousness of
   God from all blame.

   It is indeed evident that no cause is adduced higher than the will of
   God. Since there was a ready answer, that the difference depends on
   just reasons, why did not Paul adopt such a brief reply? But he placed
   the will of God in the highest rank for this reason, -- that it alone
   may suffice us for all other causes. No doubt, if the objection had
   been false, that God according to his own will rejects those whom he
   honors not with his favor, and chooses those whom he gratuitously
   loves, a refutation would not have been neglected by Paul. The ungodly
   object and say, that men are exempted from blame, if the will of God
   holds the first place in their salvation, or in their perdition. Does
   Paul deny this? Nay, by his answer he confirms it, that is, that God
   determines concerning men, as it seems good to him, and that, men in
   vain and madly rise up to contend with God; for he assigns, by his own
   right, whatever lot he pleases to what he forms.

   But they who say that Paul, wanting reason, had recourse to reproof,
   cast a grievous calumny on the Holy Spirit: for the things calculated
   to vindicate God's justice, and ready at hand, he was at first
   unwilling to adduce, for they could not have been comprehended; yea, he
   so modifies his second reason, that he does not undertake a full
   defence, but in such a manner as to give a sufficient demonstration of
   God's justice, if it be considered by us with devout humility and
   reverence.

   He reminds man of what is especially meet for him to remember, that is,
   of his own condition; as though he had said, -- "Since thou art man,
   thou ownest thyself to be dust and ashes; why then doest thou contend
   with the Lord about that which thou art not able to understand?" In a
   word, the Apostle did not bring forward what might have been said, but
   what is suitable to our ignorance. Proud men clamour, because Paul,
   admitting that men are rejected or chosen by the secret counsel of God,
   alleges no cause; as though the Spirit of God were silent for want of
   reason, and not rather, that by his silence he reminds us, that a
   mystery which our minds cannot comprehend ought to be reverently
   adored, and that he thus checks the wantonness of human curiosity. Let
   us then know, that God does for no other reason refrain from speaking,
   but that he sees that we cannot contain his immense wisdom in our small
   measure; and thus regarding our weakness, he leads us to moderation and
   sobriety.

   Does what is formed? etc. We see that Paul dwells continually on this,
   -- that the will of God, though its reason is hid from us, is to be
   counted just; for he shows that he is deprived of his right, if he is
   not at liberty to determine what he sees meet concerning his creatures.
   This seems unpleasant to the ears of many. There are also those who
   pretend that God is exposed to great reproach were such a power
   ascribed to him, as though they in their fastidiousness were better
   divines than Paul, who has laid down this as the rule of humility to
   the faithful, that they are to admire the sovereignty of God, and not
   to estimate it by their own judgment.

   But he represses this arrogance of contending with God by a most apt
   similitude, in which he seems to have alluded to Isaiah 45:9, rather
   than to Jeremiah 18:6; for nothing else is taught us by Jeremiah, than
   that Israel was in the hand of the Lord, so that he could for his sins
   wholly break him in pieces, as a potter the earthen vessel. But Isaiah
   ascends higher, "Woe to him," he says, "who speaks against his maker;"
   that is, the pot that contends with the former of the clay; "shall the
   clay say to its former, what doest thou?" etc. And surely there is no
   reason for a mortal man to think himself better than earthen vessel,
   when he compares himself with God. We are not however to be
   over-particular in applying this testimony to our present subject,
   since Paul only meant to allude to the words of the Prophet, in order
   that the similitude might have more weight. [305]

   21. Has not the worker of the clay? etc. The reason why what is formed
   ought not to contend with its former, is, that the former does nothing
   but what he has a right to do. By the word power, he means not that the
   maker has strength to do according to his will, but that this privilege
   rightly and justly belongs to him. For he intends not to claim for God
   any arbitrary power but what ought to be justly ascribed to him.

   And further, bear this in mind, -- that as the potter takes away
   nothing from the clay, whatever form he may give it; so God takes away
   nothing from man, in whatever condition he may create him. Only this is
   to be remembered, that God is deprived of a portion of his honor,
   except such an authority over men be conceded to him as to constitute
   him the arbitrator of life and death. [306]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [302] The clause rendered by Calvin, "Quid adhuc conqueritur -- why
   does he yet complain?" is rendered by Beza, "quid adhuc suecenset --
   why is he yet angry?" Our common version is the best, and is followed
   by Doddridge, Macknight, and Stuart The gar, in the next clause, is
   omitted by Calvin, but Griesbach says that it ought to be retained. --
   Ed.

   [303] "But" is not sufficiently emphatical here; menounge; "yes,
   verily," in Romans 10:18; "yea, rather," in Luke 11:28; "doubtless," in
   Philippians 3:8; it may be rendered here, "nay, rather." -- Ed.

   [304] "Quis es qui contendas judicio cum Deo;" tis ei ho
   antapokrinomenos to Theo "that repliest against God," is the rendering
   of Macknight and Stuart; "who enterest into a debate with God," is what
   Doddridge gives. The verb occurs once in another place, Luke 14:6, and
   "answer again" is our version. Schleusner says that anti prefixed to
   verbs is often redundant. In Job 16:8, and 32:12, this compound is used
   by the Septuagint simply in the sense of answering, for nh He renders
   it here, "cure Deo altercari -- to quarrel, or, dispute with God." --
   Ed.

   [305] The words in Romans 9:20 are taken almost literally from Isaiah
   29:16, only the latter clause is somewhat different; the sentence is,
   "me erei to plasma to plasanti auto ou su me eplasas -- shall what is
   formed say to its former, Thou hast not formed me?" This is a faithful
   rendering of the Hebrew. Then the words in Romans 9:21 are not verbally
   taken from either of the two places referred to above; but the simile
   is adopted. -- Ed.

   [306] The metaphor in these verses is doubtless to be interpreted
   according to the context. Not only Calvin, but many others, have
   deduced from it what is not consistent with what the next verse
   contains, which gives the necessary explanation. By the "mass" or the
   lump of clay, is not meant mankind, contemplated as creatures, but as
   fallen creatures; or, as Augustine and Pareus call them, "massa damnata
   -- the condemned mass;" for they are called in the next verse vessels
   of wrath, that is, the objects of wrath; and such are all by nature,
   according to what Paul says in Ephesians 2:3; "we were," he says, "by
   nature the children of wrath, even as others." "The words, I will have
   mercy on whom I will have mercy,' imply that all deserved wrath; so
   that the lump of clay in the hands of the potter must refer to men
   already existing in God's foreknowledge as fallen creatures." -- Scott
   In all the instances in which this metaphor is used by Isaiah and
   Jeremiah, it is applied to the Jews in their state of degeneracy, and
   very pointedly in Isaiah 64:8: where it is preceded, in the 6th verse,
   by that remarkable passage, "We are all as an unclean thing," etc. The
   clay then, or the mass, is the mass of mankind as corrupted and
   depraved. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 9:22-23

   22. What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power
   known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
   destruction:

   22. Quid autem si Deus volens demonstrare iram, et notam facere
   potentiam suam, sustinuit in multa patientia vasa irae, in interitum
   apparata;

   23. And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels
   of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

   23. Ut notas quoque faceret divitins gloriae sum in vasa misericordiae,
   quae preparavit in gloriam?

   22. And what, etc. A second answer, by which he briefly shows, that
   though the counsel of God is in fact incomprehensible, yet his
   unblamable justice shines forth no less in the perdition of the
   reprobate than in the salvation of the elect. He does not indeed give a
   reason for divine election, so as to assign a cause why this man is
   chosen and that man rejected; for it was not meet that the things
   contained in the secret counsel of God should be subjected to the
   judgment of men; and, besides, this mystery is inexplicable. He
   therefore keeps us from curiously examining those things which exceed
   human comprehension. He yet shows, that as far as God's predestination
   manifests itself, it appears perfectly just.

   The particles, ei de, used by Paul, I take to mean, And what if? so
   that the whole sentence is a question; and thus the sense will be more
   evident: and there is here an ellipsis, when we are to consider this as
   being understood, -- "Who then can charge him with unrighteousness, or
   arraign him?" for here appears nothing but the most perfect course of
   justice. [307]

   But if we wish fully to understand Paul, almost every word must be
   examined. He then argues thus, -- There are vessels prepared for
   destruction, that is, given up and appointed to destruction: they are
   also vessels of wrath, that is, made and formed for this end, that they
   may be examples of God's vengeance and displeasure. If the Lord bears
   patiently for a time with these, not destroying them at the first
   moment, but deferring the judgment prepared for them, and this in order
   to set forth the decisions of his severity, that others may be
   terrified by so dreadful examples, and also to make known his power, to
   exhibit which he makes them in various ways to serve; and, further,
   that the amplitude of his mercy towards the elect may hence be more
   fully known and more brightly shine forth; -- what is there worthy of
   being reprehended in this dispensation? But that he is silent as to the
   reason, why they are vessels appointed to destruction, is no matter of
   wonder. He indeed takes it as granted, according to what has been
   already said, that the reason is hid in the secret and inexplorable
   counsel of God; whose justice it behoves us rather to adore than to
   scrutinize.

   And he has mentioned vessels, as commonly signifying instruments; for
   whatever is done by all creatures, is, as it were, the ministration of
   divine power. For the best reason then are we, the faithful, called the
   vessels of mercy, whom the Lord uses as instruments for the
   manifestation of his mercy; and the reprobate are the vessels of wrath,
   because they serve to show forth the judgments of God.

   23. That he might also make known the riches of his glory, etc. I doubt
   not but the two particles kai hina, is an instance of a construction,
   where the first word is put last; (husteron proteron) and that this
   clause may better unite with the former, I have rendered it, That he
   might also make known, etc. (Ut notas quoque faceret, etc.) It is the
   second reason which manifests the glory of God in the destruction of
   the reprobate, because the greatness of divine mercy towards the elect
   is hereby more clearly made known; for how do they differ from them
   except that they are delivered by the Lord from the same gulf of
   destruction? and this by no merit of their own, but through his
   gratuitous kindness. It cannot then be but that the infinite mercy of
   God towards the elect must appear increasingly worthy of praise, when
   we see how miserable are all they who escape not his wrath.

   The word glory, which is here twice mentioned, I consider to have been
   used for God's mercy, a metonymy of effect for the cause; for his chief
   praise or glory is in acts of kindness. So in Ephesians 1:13, after
   having taught us, that we have been adopted to the praise of the glory
   of his grace, he adds, that we are sealed by the Spirit of promise unto
   the praise of his glory, the word grace being left out. He wished then
   to show, that the elect are instruments or vessels through whom God
   exercises his mercy, that through them he may glorify his name.

   Though in the second clause he asserts more expressly that it is God
   who prepares the elect for glory, as he had simply said before that the
   reprobate are vessels prepared for destruction; there is yet no doubt
   but that the preparation of both is connected with the secret counsel
   of God. Paul might have otherwise said, that the reprobate give up or
   cast themselves into destruction; but he intimates here, that before
   they are born they are destined to their lot.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [307] Critics have in various ways attempted to supply the ellipsis,
   but what is here proposed is most approved. Beza considered the
   corresponding clause to be at Romans 9:30, and viewed the intervening
   verses as parenthetic, "And if God," etc., -- "What then shall we say?"
   Grotius subjoined, "Does God do any wrong?" Elsner," Has he not the
   power?" and Wolfius," What canst, thou say against God?" Stuart
   proposes to repeat the question in Romans 9:20, "Who art thou?" etc.
   Some connect this verse with the question in Romans 9:20, and include
   the latter part of it and Romans 9:21 in a parenthesis. Whatever way
   may be adopted, the sense is materially the same. It has also been
   suggested that ei de is for eiper, since, seeing, 2 Thessalonians 1:6;
   1 Peter 2:3. In this case no apodosis is necessary. But we may take ei
   as meaning since, and de as an iliatire, and render the three verses
   thus, -- 22. "Since then God willed (or, it was God's will) to show His
   wrath and to make known his power, he endured with much forbearance the
   vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction; 23. So he willed to make
   known the riches of his glory towards the vessels of mercy, whom he has
   fore-prepared for glory, 24. Even us, whom he has called not only from
   the Jews but also from the Gentiles." The verb esti, or en, is often
   understood after participles, especially in Hebrew; and kai has the
   meaning of so' in some instances, Matthew 6:10; Acts 7:51; Galatians
   1:9; and in some cases, as Schleusner says, without being preceded by
   any particle of comparison, such as Matthew 12:26, and 1 John 2:27, 28;
   but ei; here stands somewhat in that character. The beginning of Romans
   9:23 presents an anomaly, if, with Stuart and others, we consider
   "willing:" or wills to be understood, as it is followed in the
   preceding verse by an infinitive, and here by a subjunctive mood. But
   Beza, Grotius, and Hammond, seem to regard the verb "endured," to be
   here, as it were, repeated, which gives the same meaning to the passage
   as that which is given to it by Calvin -- Ed.

   Romans 9:24-29

   24. Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the
   Gentiles?

   24. Quos etiam vocavit, nimirum nos, non solum ex Iudaeis, sed etiam ex
   Gentibus:

   25. As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were
   not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

   25. Quemadmodum et in Osee dicit, Vocabo populum meum eum qui non est
   populus, et dilectam cam quae non est dilecta:

   26. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
   them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of
   the living God.

   26. Et erit in loco ubi dictum est eis, Non populus meus ves, illie
   vocabuntur filii Dei viventis.

   27. Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
   children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:

   27. Iesaias autem clamat super Israel, Si fuerit numerus filiorum
   Israel ut arena maris, reliquiae servabuntur:

   28. For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness:
   because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

   28. Sermonem enim consummans et abbrevians, [308] quoniam sermonem
   abbreviatum faciet Dominus in terra:

   29. And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a
   seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

   29. Et quemadmodum prius dix erat Iesaias, Nisi Dominus Sabbaoth.
   Reliquisset nobis semen, instar Sodorate facti essemus, et Gomorrhae
   essemus assimilati.

   24. Whom he also called, etc. From the reasoning which he has been
   hitherto carrying on respecting the freedom of divine election, two
   things follow, -- that the grace of God is not so confined to the
   Jewish people that it does not also flow to other nations, and diffuse
   itself through the whole world, -- and then, that it is not even so
   tied to the Jews that it comes without exception to all the children of
   Abraham according to the flesh; for if God's election is based on his
   own good pleasure alone, wherever his will turns itself, there his
   election exists. Election being then established, the way is now in a
   manner prepared for him to proceed to those things which he designed to
   say respecting the calling of the Gentiles, and also respecting the
   rejection of the Jews; the first of which seemed strange for its
   novelty, and the other wholly unbecoming. As, however, the last had
   more in it to offend, he speaks in the first place of that which was
   less disliked. He says then, that the vessels of God's mercy, whom he
   selects for the glory of his name, are taken from every people, from
   the Gentiles no less than from the Jews.

   But though in the relative whom the rule of grammar is not fully
   observed by Paul, [309] yet his object was, by making as it were a
   transition, to subjoin that we are the vessels of God's glory, who have
   been taken in part from the Jews and in part from the Gentiles; and he
   proves from the calling of God, that there is no difference between
   nations made in election. For if to be descended from the Gentiles was
   no hinderance that God should not call us, it is evident that the
   Gentiles are by no means to be excluded from the kingdom of God and the
   covenant of eternal salvation.

   25. As he says in Hosea, [310] etc. He proves now that the calling of
   the Gentiles ought not to have been deemed a new thing, as it had long
   before been testified by the prediction of the prophet. The meaning is
   evident; but there is some difficulty in the application of this
   testimony; for no one can deny but that the prophet in that passage
   speaks of the Israelites. For the Lord, having been offended with their
   wickedness, declared that they should be no longer his people: he
   afterwards subjoined a consolation, and said, that of those who were
   not beloved he would make some beloved, and from those who were not a
   people he would make a people. But Paul applies to the Gentiles what
   was expressly spoken to the Israelites.

   They who have hitherto been most successful in untying this knot have
   supposed that Paul meant to adopt this kind of reasoning, -- "What may
   seem to be an hinderance to the Gentiles to become partakers of
   salvation did also exist as to the Jewish nation: as then God did
   formerly receive into favor the Jews, whom he had cast away and
   exterminated, so also now he exercises the same kindness towards the
   Gentiles." But as this interpretation, though it may be supported, yet
   seems to me to be somewhat strained, let the readers consider this, --
   Whether it would not be a more suitable view to regard the consolation
   given by the prophet, as intended, not only for the Jews, but also for
   the Gentiles: for it was not a new or an unusual thing with the
   prophets, after having pronounced on the Jews God's vengeance on
   account of their sins, to turn themselves to the kingdom of Christ,
   which was to be propagated through the whole world. And this they did,
   not without reason; for since the Jews so provoked God's wrath by their
   sins, that they deserved to be rejected by him, no hope of salvation
   remained, except they turned to Christ, through whom the covenant of
   grace was to be restored: and as it was based on him, so it was then
   renewed, when he interposed. And doubtless, as Christ was the only
   refuge in great extremities, no solid comfort could have been brought
   to miserable sinners, and such as saw God's wrath impending over them,
   except by setting Christ before their eyes, it was usual with the
   prophets, as we have reminded you, after having humbled the people by
   pronouncing on them divine vengeance, to call their attention to
   Christ, as the only true asylum of those in despair. And where the
   kingdom of Christ is erected there also is raised up that celestial
   Jerusalem, into which citizens from all parts of the world assemble.
   And this is what is chiefly included in the present prophecy: for when
   the Jews were banished from God's family, they were thus reduced to a
   common class, and put on a level with the Gentiles. The difference
   being taken away, God's mercy is now indiscriminately extended to all
   the Gentiles. We hence see that the prophet's prediction is fitly
   applied to the present subject; in which God declares, that after
   having equalized the Jews and the Gentiles, he would gather a Church
   for himself from aliens, so that they who were not a people would begin
   to be so.

   26. I will call them my people which are not a people This is said with
   respect to the divorce, which God had already made with the people, by
   depriving them of all honor, so that they did not excel other nations.
   Though they indeed, whom God in his eternal counsel has destined as
   sons to himself, are perpetually his sons, yet Scripture in many parts
   counts none to be God's children but those the election of whom has
   been proved by their calling: and hence he teaches us not to judge,
   much less to decide, respecting God's election, except as far as it
   manifests itself by its own evidences. Thus Paul, after having shown to
   the Ephesians that their election and adoption had been determined by
   God before the creation of the world, shortly after declares, that they
   were once alienated from God, (Ephesians 2:12,) that is, during that
   time when the Lord had not manifested his love towards them; though he
   had embraced them in his eternal mercy. Hence, in this passage, they
   are said not to be beloved, to whom God declares wrath rather than
   love: for until adoption reconciles men to God, we know that his wrath
   abides on them.

   The feminine gender of the participle depends on the context of the
   prophet; for he had said, that a daughter had been born to him, to whom
   he gave this name, Not beloved, in order that the people might know
   that they were hated by God. Now as rejection was the reason for
   hatred, so the beginning of love, as the prophet teaches, is, when God
   adopts those who had been for a time strangers. [311]

   27. And Isaiah exclaims, etc. He proceeds now to the second part, with
   which he was unwilling to begin, lest he should too much exasperate
   their minds. And it is not without a wise contrivance, that he adduces
   Isaiah as exclaiming, not, speaking, in order that he might excite more
   attention. But the words of the Prophet were evidently intended to keep
   the Jews from glorying too much in the flesh: for it was a thing
   dreadful to be heard, that of so large a multitude, a small number only
   would obtain salvation. For though the Prophet, after having described
   the devastation of the people, lest the faithful should think that the
   covenant of God was wholly abolished, gave some remaining hope of
   favor; yet he confined it to a few. But as the Prophet predicted of his
   own time, let us see how could Paul rightly apply this to his purpose.
   It must be in this sense, -- When the Lord resolved to deliver his
   people from the Babylonian captivity, his purpose was, that this
   benefit of deliverance should come only to a very few of that vast
   multitude; which might have been said to be the remnant of that
   destruction, when compared with the great number which he suffered to
   perish in exile. Now that temporal restoration was typical of the real
   renovation of the Church of God; yea, it was only its commencement.
   What therefore happened then, is to be now much more completely
   fulfilled as the very progress and completion of that deliverance.

   28. For I will finish and shorten the matter, etc. [312] Omitting
   various interpretations, I will state what appears to me to be the real
   meaning: The Lord will so cut short, and cut off his people, that the
   residue may seem as it were a consumption, that is, may have the
   appearance and the vestige of a very great ruin. However, the few who
   shall remain from the consumption shall be a proof of the work of God's
   righteousness, or, what I prefer, shall serve to testify the
   righteousness of God throughout the world. As word often in Scripture
   means a thing, the consummated word is put for consumption. Many
   interpreters have here been grossly mistaken, who have attempted to
   philosophize with too much refinement; for they have imagined, that the
   doctrine of the gospel is thus called, because it is, when the
   ceremonies are cut off, a brief compendium of the law; though the word
   means on the contrary a consumption. [313] And not only here is an
   error committed by the translator, but also in Isaiah 10:22, 23; Isaiah
   28:22; and in Ezekiel 11:13; where it is said, "Ah! ah! Lord God! wilt
   thou make a completion of the remnant of Israel?" But the Prophets
   meant to say, "Wilt thou destroy the very remnant with utter
   destruction?" And this has happened through the ambiguity of the Hebrew
   word. For as the word, klh, cale, means to finish and to perfect, as
   well as to consume, this difference has not been sufficiently observed
   according to the passages in which it occurs.

   But Isaiah has not in this instance adopted one word only, but has put
   down two words, consumption, and termination, or cutting off; so that
   the affectation of Hebraism in the Greek translator was singularly
   unseasonable; for to what purpose was it to involve a sentence, in
   itself clear, in an obscure and figurative language? It may be further
   added, that Isaiah speaks here hyperbolically; for by consumption he
   means diminution, such as is wont to be after a remarkable slaughter.

   29. And as Isaiah had before said, etc. [314] He brings another
   testimony from the first chapter, where the Prophet deplores the
   devastation of Israel in his time: and as this had happened once, it
   was no new thing. The people of Israel had indeed no pre-eminence,
   except what they had derived from their ancestors; who had yet been in
   such a manner treated, that the Prophet complained that they had been
   so afflicted, that they were not far from having been destroyed, as
   Sodom and Gomorrah had been. There was, however, this difference, that
   a few were preserved for a seed, to raise up the name, that they might
   not wholly perish, and be consigned to eternal oblivion. For it behoved
   God to be ever mindful of his promise, so as to manifest his mercy in
   the midst of the severest judgments.

   [308] "In righteousness," left out. The word rendered "matter" is
   "sermo," But it is explained in this sense in the comment. -- Ed.

   [309] It is an instance of Hebraism, the use of a double pronoun --
   whom and us, governed by the same verb. -- Ed.

   [310] Hosea 2:23. See 1 Peter 2:10.

   [311] The quotation is from Hosea 2:23, and is not literal either from
   the Hebrew or from the Septuagint. The order of the verse is reversed;
   and the word "beloved" is taken from the Septuagint. "Not beloved," in
   Hebrew, is lo-ruhamah, i.e., one not pitied, or one who has not
   received mercy: which is the same in meaning. In Romans 9:26, the words
   are taken from Hosea 1:10 and are not verbatim either from the Hebrew
   or the Septuagint, but the difference is very trifling. -- Ed.

   [312] Sermonem enim consummans et abbrevians," etc.; Logon gar, etc. It
   is literally the Septuagint except in two instances: Paul puts in gar,
   and substitutes epi tos gos for en tho oikoumenHu holHu. It is a
   difficult passage in Hebrew: but the following rendering will make it
   materially consistent with the words of the Apostle, who evidently did
   not intend to give the words literally. A destruction, soon executed,
   Shall overflow in righteousness;
   For completed and soon executed shall it be;
   The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall do it,
   In the midst of the whole land. The word rendered above "soon
   executed," means literally, abbreviated or cut short, signifying the
   quick execution of a thing or work. "Shall overflow in righteousness,"
   imports, "shall justly or deservedly overflow." -- Ed.

   [313] There are many venerable names in favour of this opinion, such as
   Ambrose, Chrysostom, Augustine, etc. Not knowing the Hebrew language,
   they attached a classical meaning to the expression, logon
   suntetmemenon, wholly at variance with what the Hebrew means, as Calvin
   justly observes. The word, suntetmemenon, in this passage, as
   Schleusner says, bears a meaning different from what it has in the
   classics; it imports what is cut short, that is, quickly executed. --
   Ed.

   [314] Isaiah 1:9. The words of the Septuagint are given literally, and
   differ only in one instance from the Hebrew; "seed" is put for
   "remnant;" but as "seed" in this case evidently means a small portion
   reserved for sowing, the idea of the original is conveyed. Schleusner
   refers to examples both in Josephus and Plato, in which the word
   "seed," is used in the sense of a small reserved portion. Its most
   common meaning in Scripture is posterity. Paul has given "Sabaoth" from
   the Septuagint, which is the Hebrew untranslated. This word, in
   connection with God, is variously rendered by the Septuagint: for the
   most part in Isaiah, and in some other places, it is found untranslated
   as here; but in the Psalms and in other books, it is often rendered ton
   dunameon, that is, Jehovah or Lord "of the powers," and often
   pantokrator, "omnipotent;" and sometimes ho hagios "the holy one." But
   our version, "Jehovah" or "Lord of hosts," is the proper rendering. It
   means the hosts of animate and inanimate creatures; in fact, the whole
   universe, all created things; but, according to the context, it often
   specifically refers to material things, or to things immaterial. -- Ed.

   Romans 9:30-33

   30. What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after
   righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness
   which is of faith.

   30. Quid ergo dicemus? Quod gentes quae non sectabantur justitiam,
   adeptae sunt justitiam, justi-tiam autem ex fide:

   31. But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not
   attained to the law of righteousness.

   31. Israel autem sectando legem justitiae, ad legem justitiae non
   pervenit.

   32. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by
   the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

   32. Quare? Quid non ex fide, sed quasi ex operibus; offenderunt enim ad
   lapidem offensionis:

   33. As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock
   of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

   33. Quemadmodum scriptum eat, Ecce pono in Sion lapidem offensionis et
   petram offendiculi: et omnis qui crediderit in eum non pudefiet.

   30. What then, etc. That he might cut off from the Jews every occasion
   of murmuring against God, he now begins to show those causes, which may
   be comprehended by human minds, why the Jewish nation had been
   rejected. But they do what is absurd and invert all order, who strive
   to assign and set up causes above the secret predestination of God,
   which he has previously taught us is to be counted as the first cause.
   But as this is superior to all other causes, so the corruption and
   wickedness of the ungodly afford a reason and an occasion for the
   judgments of God: and as he was engaged on a difficult point, he
   introduced a question, and, as though he were in doubt, asked what
   might be said on the subject.

   That the Gentiles who did not pursue, etc. Nothing appeared more
   unreasonable, or less befitting, than that the Gentiles, who, having no
   concern for righteousness, rolled themselves in the lasciviousness of
   their flesh, should be called to partake of salvation, and to obtain
   righteousness; and that, on the other hand, the Jews, who assiduously
   laboured in the works of the law, should be excluded from the reward of
   righteousness. Paul brings forward this, which was so singular a
   paradox, in such a manner, that by adding a reason he softens whatever
   asperity there might be in it; for he says, that the righteousness
   which the Gentiles attained was by faith; and that it hence depends on
   the Lord's mercy, and not on man's own worthiness; and that a zeal for
   the law, by which the Jews were actuated, was absurd; for they sought
   to be justified by works, and thus laboured for what no man could
   attain to; and still further, they stumbled at Christ, through whom
   alone a way is open to the attainment of righteousness.

   But in the first clause it was the Apostle's object to exalt the grace
   of God alone, that no other reason might be sought for in the calling
   of the Gentiles but this, -- that he deigned to embrace them when
   unworthy of his favor.

   He speaks expressly of righteousness, without which there can be no
   salvation: but by saying that the righteousness of the Gentiles
   proceeded from faith, he intimates, that it was based on a gratuitous
   reconciliation; for if any one imagines that they were justified,
   because they had by faith obtained the Spirit of regeneration, he
   departs far from the meaning of Paul; it would not indeed have been
   true, that they had attained what they sought not, except God had
   freely embraced them while they were straying and wandering, and had
   offered them righteousness, for which, being unknown, they could have
   had no desire. It must also be observed, that the Gentiles could not
   have obtained righteousness by faith, except God had anticipated their
   faith by his grace; for they followed it when they first by faith
   aspired to righteousness; and so faith itself is a portion of his
   favor.

   31. But Israel, by pursuing, etc. Paul openly states what seemed
   incredible, -- that it was no wonder that the Jews gained nothing by
   sedulously following after righteousness; for by running out of the
   way, they wearied themselves in vain. But in the first place it seems
   to me that the law of righteousness is here an instance of
   transposition, and means the righteousness of the law; [315] and then,
   that when repeated in the second clause, it is to be taken in another
   sense, as signifying the model or the rule of righteousness.

   The meaning then is, -- "That Israel, depending on the righteousness of
   the law, even that which is prescribed in the law, did not understand
   the true method of justification." But there is a striking contrast in
   the expression, when he teaches us that the legal righteousness was the
   cause that they had fallen away from the law of righteousness.

   32. Not by faith, but as it were by works, etc. As false zeal seems
   commonly to be justly excused, Paul shows that they are deservedly
   rejected, who attempt to attain salvation by trusting in their own
   works; for they, as far as they can, abolish faith, without which no
   salvation can be expected. Hence, were they to gain their object, such
   a success would be the annihilation of true righteousness. You farther
   see how faith and the merits of works are contrasted, as things
   altogether contrary to each other. As then trust in works is the chief
   hinderance, by which our way to obtain righteousness is closed up, it
   is necessary that we should wholly renounce it in order that we may
   depend on God's goodness alone. This example of the Jews ought indeed
   justly to terrify all those who strive to obtain the kingdom of God by
   works. Nor does he understand by the works of the law, ceremonial
   observances, as it has been before shown, but the merits of those works
   to which faith is opposed, which looks, as I may say, with both eyes on
   the mercy of God alone, without casting one glance on any worthiness of
   its own.

   For they have stumbled at the stone, etc. He confirms by a strong
   reason the preceding sentence. There is indeed nothing more
   inconsistent than that they should obtain righteousness who strive to
   destroy it. Christ has been given to us for righteousness, whosoever
   obtrudes on God the righteousness of works, attempts to rob him of his
   own office. And hence it appears that whenever men, under the empty
   pretence of being zealous for righteousness, put confidence in their
   works, they do in their furious madness carry on war with God himself.

   But how they stumble at Christ, who trust in their works, it is not
   difficult to understand; for except we own ourselves to be sinners,
   void and destitute of any righteousness of our own, we obscure the
   dignity of Christ, which consists in this, that to us all he is light,
   life, resurrection, righteousness, and healing. But how is he all these
   things, except that he illuminates the blind, restores the lost,
   quickens the dead, raises up those who are reduced to nothing, cleanses
   those who are full of filth, cures and heals those infected with
   diseases? Nay, when we claim for ourselves any righteousness we in a
   manner contend with the power of Christ; for his office is no less to
   beat down all the pride of the flesh, than to relieve and comfort those
   who labour and are wearied under their burden.

   The quotation is rightly made; for God in that passage declares that he
   would be to the people of Judah and of Israel for a rock of offence, at
   which they should stumble and fall. Since Christ is that God who spoke
   by the Prophets, it is no wonder that this also should be fulfilled in
   him. And by calling Christ the stone of stumbling, he reminds us that
   it is not to be wondered at if they made no progress in the way of
   righteousness, who through their wilful stubbornness stumbled at the
   rock of offence, when God had showed to them the way so plainly. [316]
   But we must observe, that this stumbling does not properly belong to
   Christ viewed in himself; but, on the contrary, it is what happens
   through the wickedness of men, according to what immediately follows.

   33. And every one who believes in him shall not be ashamed. He subjoins
   this testimony from another part for the consolation of the godly; as
   though he had said, "Because Christ is called the stone of stumbling,
   there is no reason that we should dread him, or entertain fear instead
   of confidence; for he is appointed for ruin to the unbelieving, but for
   life and resurrection to the godly." As then the former prophecy,
   concerning the stumbling and offence, is fulfilled in the rebellious
   and unbelieving, so there is another which is intended for the godly,
   and that is, that he is a firm stone, precious, a corner-stone, most
   firmly fixed, and whosoever builds on it shall never fall. By putting
   shall not be ashamed instead of shall not hasten or fall, he has
   followed the Greek Translator. It is indeed certain that the Lord in
   that passage intended to strengthen the hope of His people: and when
   the Lord bids us to entertain good hope, it hence follows that we
   cannot be ashamed. [317] See a passage like this in 1 Peter 2:10
     __________________________________________________________________

   [315] There seems to be no necessity for this transposition. "A law
   (not the law) of righteousness" means a law which prescribes
   righteousness, and which, if done, would have conferred righteousness.
   But the Jews following this did not attain to a law of righteousness,
   such a law as secured righteousness. The Apostle often uses the same
   words in the same verse in a different sense, and leaves the meaning to
   be made out by the context. Grotius takes "law" as meaning way, "They
   followed the way of righteousness, but did not attain to a way of
   righteousness." What follows the question in the next verse stands more
   connected with Romans 9:30 than with Romans 9:31; and we must consider
   that the word righteousness, and not law, is referred to by "it" after
   the verb "pursue," which is evidently to be understood before the
   words, "not by faith," etc., as the sentence is clearly elliptical. The
   verb dioko, rendered "sector" by Calvin, means strictly to pursue what
   flees away from us, whether a wild beast or an enemy; it signifies also
   to follow a leader, and to run a race, and further, to desire, to
   attend to, or earnestly to seek a thing: and in this latter sense Paul
   often uses it. See Romans 12:13; Romans 14:19; 1 Corinthians 14:1.
   Similar is the application of the corresponding verb, rdph in Hebrew.
   See Deuteronomy 16:20; Psalm 34:14 "Quaero -- to seek," is the word
   adopted by Grotius But Pareus and Hammond consider that there are here
   three agonistic terms, diokon katelabe, and ephthase. The first
   signifies the running; the third, the reaching of the goal; and the
   second, the laying hold on the prize: and with this corresponds the
   stumbling afterwards mentioned. The Gentiles did not run at all, but
   the Jews did, and in running, they stumbled; while the Gentiles reached
   the goal, not by running, or by their own efforts, but by faith, and
   laid hold on the prize of righteousness. -- Ed.

   [316] "Error is often a greater obstacle to the salvation of men than
   carelessness or vice... Let no man think error in doctrine a slight
   practical evil. No road to perdition has ever been more thronged than
   that of false doctrine. Error is a shield over the conscience and a
   bandage over the eyes." -- Professor Hodge

   [317] The citation in this verse is made in a remarkable manner. The
   first part, "Behold I lay in Zion," is taken from Isaiah 28:16; what
   follows, "a stone of stumbling and rock of offense," is taken from
   Isaiah 8:14; and then the last words, "and whosoever believes in him
   shall not be ashamed," are given from the preceding passage in Isaiah
   28:16. The subject is the same. With respect to the last clause Paul
   has followed the Septuagint, "shall not be ashamed." But the Hebrew
   word, rendered in our version "shall not make haste," will bear a
   similar meaning, and may be translated, shall not hurry or be
   confounded. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 10
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 10:1-4

   1. Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that
   they might be saved.

   1. Fratres, benevolentia certe cordis mei, et deprecatio ad Deum super
   Israel, est in salutem.

   2. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
   according to knowledge.

   2. Testimonium enim reddo illis, quod zelum Dei habent, sed non
   secundum scientiam:

   3. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God.

   3. Ignorantes enim Dei justitiam, et propriam justitiam quaerentes
   statuere, justitiae Dei subjecti non fuerunt;

   4. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
   believeth.

   4. Finis enim Legis Christus in justitiam omni credenti. [318]

   1. We here see with what solicitude the holy man obviated offenses; for
   in order to soften whatever sharpness there may have been in his manner
   of explaining the rejection of the Jews, he still testifies, as before,
   his goodwill towards them, and proves it by the effect; for their
   salvation was an object of concern to him before the Lord, and such a
   feeling arises only from genuine love. It may be at the same time that
   he was also induced by another reason to testify his love towards the
   nation from which he had sprung; for his doctrine would have never been
   received by the Jews had they thought that he was avowedly inimical to
   them; and his defection would have been also suspected by the Gentiles,
   for they would have thought, as we have said in the last chapter, that
   he became an apostate from the law through his hatred of men. [319]

   2. For I bear to them a testimony, etc. This was intended to secure
   credit to his love. There was indeed a just cause why he should regard
   them with compassion rather than hatred, since he perceived that they
   had fallen only through ignorance, and not through malignancy of mind,
   and especially as he saw that they were not led except by some regard
   for God to persecute the kingdom of Christ. Let us hence learn where
   our good intentions may guide us, if we yield to them. It is commonly
   thought a good and a very fit excuse, when he who is reproved pretends
   that he meant no harm. And this pretext is held good by many at this
   day, so that they apply not their minds to find out the truth of God,
   because they think that whatever they do amiss through ignorance,
   without any designed maliciousness, but with good intention, is
   excusable. But no one of us would excuse the Jews for having crucified
   Christ, for having cruelly raged against the Apostles, and for having
   attempted to destroy and extinguish the gospel; and yet they had the
   same defense as that in which we confidently glory. Away then with
   these vain evasions as to good intention; if we seek God sincerely, let
   us follow the way by which alone we can come to him. For it is better,
   as Augustine says, even to go limping in the right way than to run with
   all our might out of the way. If we would be really religious, let us
   remember that what Lactantius teaches is true, that true religion is
   alone that which is connected with the word of God. [320]

   And further, since we see that they perish, who with good intention
   wander in darkness, let us bear in mind, that we are worthy of thousand
   deaths, if after having been illuminated by God, we wander knowingly
   and willfully from the right way.

   3. For being ignorant of the righteousness of God, etc. See how they
   went astray through inconsiderate zeal! for they sought to set up a
   righteousness of their own; and this foolish confidence proceeded from
   their ignorance of God's righteousness. Notice the contrast between the
   righteousness of God and that of men. We first see, that they are
   opposed to one another, as things wholly contrary, and cannot stand
   together. It hence follows, that God's righteousness is subverted, as
   soon as men set up their own. And again, as there is a correspondence
   between the things contrasted, the righteousness of God is no doubt his
   gift; and in like manner, the righteousness of men is that which they
   derive from themselves, or believe that they bring before God. Then he
   who seeks to be justified through himself, submits not to God's
   righteousness; for the first step towards obtaining the righteousness
   of God is to renounce our own righteousness: for why is it, that we
   seek righteousness from another, except that necessity constrains us?

   We have already stated, in another place, how men put on the
   righteousness of God by faith, that is, when the righteousness of
   Christ is imputed to them. But Paul grievously dishonors the pride by
   which hypocrites are inflated, when they cover it with the specious
   mask of zeal; for he says, that all such, by shaking off as it were the
   yoke, are adverse to and rebel against the righteousness of God.

   4. For the end of the law is Christ, etc. The word completion, [321]
   seems not to me unsuitable in this place; and Erasmus has rendered it
   perfection: but as the other reading is almost universally approved,
   and is not inappropriate, readers, for my part, may retain it.

   The Apostle obviates here an objection which might have been made
   against him; for the Jews might have appeared to have kept the right
   way by depending on the righteousness of the law. It was necessary for
   him to disprove this false opinion; and this is what he does here. He
   shows that he is a false interpreter of the law, who seeks to be
   justified by his own works; because the law had been given for this
   end, -- to lead us as by the hand to another righteousness: nay,
   whatever the law teaches, whatever it commands, whatever it promises,
   has always a reference to Christ as its main object; and hence all its
   parts ought to be applied to him. But this cannot be done, except we,
   being stripped of all righteousness, and confounded with the knowledge
   of our sin, seek gratuitous righteousness from him alone.

   It hence follows, that the wicked abuse of the law was justly
   reprehended in the Jews, who absurdly made an obstacle of that which
   was to be their help: nay, it appears that they had shamefully
   mutilated the law of God; for they rejected its soul, and seized on the
   dead body of the letter. For though the law promises reward to those
   who observe its righteousness, it yet substitutes, after having proved
   all guilty, another righteousness in Christ, which is not attained by
   works, but is received by faith as a free gift. Thus the righteousness
   of faith, (as we have seen in the first chapter,) receives a testimony
   from the law. We have then here a remarkable passage, which proves that
   the law in all its parts had a reference to Christ; and hence no one
   can rightly understand it, who does not continually level at this mark.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [318] The gar, "for," at the beginning of Romans 10:4, connects it with
   the latter part of the preceding, as the gar, "for," in the preceding
   connects it with the latter part of Romans 10:2; and gar also in Romans
   10:5 expresses a reason for what Romans 10:4 contains. So that we have
   a regular chain; the following sentence gives a reason for the one
   immediately preceding in four instances. -- Ed.

   [319] Calvin's Latin for this verse is: "Fratres, benevolentia certe
   cordis mei et deprecatio ad Deum super Israel est in salutem --
   Brethren, the goodwill indeed of my heart and prayer to God for Israel
   is for their salvation." The word for "goodwill," eudokia, means a kind
   disposition towards another, it means here a benevolent or a sincere
   desire, or, according to Theophylact, an earnest desire. Doddridge
   renders it "affectionate desire;" Beza, "propensa voluntas -- propense
   wish;" and Stuart, "kind desire." At the beginning of the last chapter
   the Apostle expressed his great grief for his brethren the Jews, he now
   expresses his great love towards them, and his strong desire for their
   highest good -- their salvation. -- Ed.

   [320] "A zeal of God," zelon Theou, is a zeal for God, a genitive case
   of the object. Some regard "God" here as meaning something great, as it
   is sometimes used in Hebrew, and render the phrase, as Macknight does,
   "a great zeal;" but this is not required by the context. The Jews had
   professedly "a zeal for God," but not accompanied with knowledge. The
   necessity of knowledge as the guide of zeal is noted by Turrettin in
   four particulars: 1. That we may distinguish truth from falsehood, as
   there may be zeal for error and false doctrine as well as for that
   which is true; 2. That we may understand the comparative importance of
   things, so as not to make much of what is little, and make little
   account of what is great; 3. That we may prosecute and defend the truth
   in the right way, with prudence, firmness, fidelity, and meekness; 4.
   That our zeal may have the right object, not our own interest and
   reputation, but the glory of God and the salvation of men. -- Ed.

   [321] "Complementum -- the complement," the filling up, the completion.
   The word telos, "end," is used in various ways, as signifying -- 1. The
   terminations of any thing, either of evils, or of life, etc., Matthew
   10:22; John 13:1; -- 2. Completion or fulfillment, Luke 22:37; 1
   Timothy 1:5; -- 3. The issue, the effect, the consequence, the result,
   Romans 6:21; 1 Peter 1:9; 2 Corinthians 11:15; -- 4. Tribute or custom,
   Romans 13:7; -- 5. The chief thing, summary or substance, 1 Peter 3:8
   The meaning of the word depends on what is connected with it. The end
   of evils, or of life, is their termination; the end of a promise is its
   fulfillment; the end of a command, its performance or obedience; the
   end of faith is salvation. In such instances, the general idea is the
   result, or the effect, or the consequence. Now the law may be viewed as
   an economy, comprising the whole Jewish law, not perfect, but
   introductory; in this view Christ may be said to be its end -- its
   perfection or "its landing place." But we may also regard the law in
   its moral character, as the rule and condition of life; then the end of
   the law is its fulfillment, the performance of what it requires to
   attain life: and Christ in this respect is its end, having rendered to
   it perfect obedience. This last meaning is most consistent with the
   words which follow, and with the Apostle's argument. The first view is
   taken by Chrysostom, Beza, Turrettin, as well as Calvin; the second, by
   Mede, Stuart, and Chalmers. There is really not much difference in the
   two views; only the sequel of the verse, "for righteousness to every
   one who believes," and the opposite sentiment in the next verse, "the
   man who doeth these shall live in (or through) them," seem to favor the
   latter view. -- Ed.

   Romans 10:5-10

   5. For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the
   man which doeth those things shall live by them.

   5. Moses enim describit justitiam quae est ex Lege, Quod qui fecerit ea
   homo rivet in ipsis.

   6. But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say
   not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring
   Christ down from above:)

   6. Quae vero est ex fide justitia sic dicit, Ne dixeris in corde tuo,
   Quis ascendet in coelum? hoc est Christum deducere:

   7. Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ
   again from the dead.)

   7. Aut, Quis descendet in abyssum? hoc est Christum ex mortuis
   reducere:

   8. But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in
   thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

   8. Sed quid dicit? Prope est verbum, in ore tuo et in corde tuo; hoc
   est verbum fidei quod praedicamus,

   9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
   believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
   shalt be saved.

   9. Quod si confessus fueris in ore tuo Dominum Iesum, et credideris in
   corde tuo quod Deus suscitavit illum ex mortuis, salvus eris:

   10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation.

   10. Corde enim creditur in justitiam, ore fit confessio in salutem.

   5. For Moses, etc. To render it evident how much at variance is the
   righteousness of faith and that of works, he now compares them; for by
   comparison the opposition between contrary things appears more clear.
   But he refers not now to the oracles of the Prophets, but to the
   testimony of Moses, and for this reason, -- that the Jews might
   understand that the law was not given by Moses in order to detain them
   in a dependence on works, but, on the contrary, to lead them to Christ.
   He might have indeed referred to the Prophets as witnesses; but still
   this doubt must have remained, "How was it that the law prescribed
   another rule of righteousness?" He then removes this, and in the best
   manner, when by the teaching of the law itself he confirms the
   righteousness of faith.

   But we ought to understand the reason why Paul harmonizes the law with
   faith, and yet sets the righteousness of one in opposition to that of
   the other: -- The law has a twofold meaning; it sometimes includes the
   whole of what has been taught by Moses, and sometimes that part only
   which was peculiar to his ministration, which consisted of precepts,
   rewards, and punishments. But Moses had this common office -- to teach
   the people the true rule of religion. Since it was so, it behooved him
   to preach repentance and faith; but faith is not taught, except by
   propounding promises of divine mercy, and those gratuitous: and thus it
   behooved him to be a preacher of the gospel; which office he faithfully
   performed, as it appears from many passages. In order to instruct the
   people in the doctrine of repentance, it was necessary for him to teach
   what manner of life was acceptable to God; and this he included in the
   precepts of the law. That he might also instill into the minds of the
   people the love of righteousness, and implant in them the hatred of
   iniquity, promises and threatening were added; which proposed rewards
   to the just, and denounced dreadful punishments on sinners. It was now
   the duty of the people to consider in how many ways they drew curses on
   themselves, and how far they were from deserving anything at God's
   hands by their works, that being thus led to despair as to their own
   righteousness, they might flee to the haven of divine goodness, and so
   to Christ himself. This was the end or design of the Mosaic
   dispensation.

   But as evangelic promises are only found scattered in the writings of
   Moses, and these also somewhat obscure, and as the precepts and
   rewards, allotted to the observers of the law, frequently occur, it
   rightly appertained to Moses as his own and peculiar office, to teach
   what is the real righteousness of works, and then to show what
   remuneration awaits the observance of it, and what punishment awaits
   those who come short of it. For this reason Moses is by John compared
   with Christ, when it is said,

   "That the law was given by Moses, but that grace
   and truth came by Christ." (John 1:17.)

   And whenever the word law is thus strictly taken, Moses is by
   implication opposed to Christ: and then we must consider what the law
   contains, as separate from the gospel. Hence what is said here of the
   righteousness of the law, must be applied, not to the whole office of
   Moses, but to that part which was in a manner peculiarly committed to
   him. I come now to the words.

   For Moses describes, etc. Paul has graphei writes; which is used for a
   verb which means to describe, by taking away a part of it [epigraphei.]
   The passage is taken from Leviticus 18:5, where the Lord promises
   eternal life to those who would keep his law; for in this sense, as you
   see, Paul has taken the passage, and not only of temporal life, as some
   think. Paul indeed thus reasons, -- "Since no man can attain the
   righteousness prescribed in the law, except he fulfills strictly every
   part of it, and since of this perfection all men have always come far
   short, it is in vain for any one to strive in this way for salvation:
   Israel then were very foolish, who expected to attain the righteousness
   of the law, from which we are all excluded." See how from the promise
   itself he proves, that it can avail us nothing, and for this reason,
   because the condition is impossible. What a futile device it is then to
   allege legal promises, in order to establish the righteousness of the
   law! For with these an unavoidable curse comes to us; so far is it,
   that salvation should thence proceed. The more detestable on this
   account is the stupidity of the Papists, who think it enough to prove
   merits by adducing bare promises. "It is not in vain," they say, "that
   God has promised life to his servants." But at the same time they see
   not that it has been promised, in order that a consciousness of their
   own transgressions may strike all with the fear of death, and that
   being thus constrained by their own deficiency, they may learn to flee
   to Christ.

   6. But the righteousness [322] which is by faith, etc. This passage is
   such as may not a little disturb the reader, and for two reasons -- for
   it seems to be improperly applied by Paul -- and the words are also
   turned to a different meaning. Of the words we shall hereafter see what
   may be said: we shall first notice the application. It is a passage
   taken from Deuteronomy 30:12, where, as in the former passage, Moses
   speaks of the doctrine of the law, and Paul applies it to evangelic
   promises. This knot may be thus untied: -- Moses shows, that the way to
   life was made plain: for the will of God was not now hid from the Jews,
   nor set far off from them, but placed before their eyes. If he had
   spoken of the law only, his reasoning would have been frivolous, since
   the law of God being set before their eyes, it was not easier to do it,
   than if it was afar off. He then means not the law only, but generally
   the whole of God's truth, which includes in it the gospel: for the word
   of the law by itself is never in our heart, no, not the least syllable
   of it, until it is implanted in us by the faith of the gospel. And
   then, even after regeneration, the word of the law cannot properly be
   said to be in our heart; for it demands perfection, from which even the
   faithful are far distant: but the word of the gospel has a seat in the
   heart, though it does not fill the heart; for it offers pardon for
   imperfection and defect. And Moses throughout that chapter, as also in
   the fourth, endeavors to commend to the people the remarkable kindness
   of God, because he had taken them under his own tuition and government,
   which commendation could not have belonged to the law only. It is no
   objection that Moses there speaks of forming the life according to the
   rule of the law; for the spirit of regeneration is connected with the
   gratuitous righteousness of faith. Nor is there a doubt but that this
   verse depends on that main truth, "the Lord shall circumcise thine
   heart," which he had recorded shortly before in the same chapter. They
   may therefore be easily disproved, who say that Moses speaks only in
   that passage of good works. That he speaks of works I indeed allow; but
   I deny it to be unreasonable, that the keeping of the law should be
   traced from its own fountain, even from the righteousness of faith. The
   explanation of the words must now follow. [323]

   Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend? etc. Moses mentions heaven
   and the sea, as places remote and difficult of access to men. But Paul,
   as though there was some spiritual mystery concealed under these words,
   applies them to the death and resurrection of Christ. If any one thinks
   that this interpretation is too strained and too refined, let him
   understand that it was not the object of the Apostle strictly to
   explain this passage, but to apply it to the explanation of his present
   subject. He does not, therefore, repeat verbally what Moses has said,
   but makes alterations, by which he accommodates more suitably to his
   own purpose the testimony of Moses. He spoke of inaccessible places;
   Paul refers to those, which are indeed hid from the sight of us all,
   and may yet be seen by our faith. If then you take these things as
   spoken for illustration, or by way of improvement, you cannot say that
   Paul has violently or inaptly changed the words of Moses; but you will,
   on the contrary, allow, that without loss of meaning, he has, in a
   striking manner, alluded to the words heaven and the sea.

   Let us now then simply explain the words of Paul: As the assurance of
   our salvation lies on two foundations, that is, when we understand,
   that life has been obtained for us, and death has been conquered for
   us, he teaches us that faith through the word of the gospel is
   sustained by both these; for Christ, by dying, destroyed death, and by
   rising again he obtained life in his own power. The benefit of Christ's
   death and resurrection is now communicated to us by the gospel: there
   is then no reason for us to seek anything farther. That it may thus
   appear, that the righteousness of faith is abundantly sufficient for
   salvation, he teaches us, that included in it are these two things,
   which are alone necessary for salvation. The import then of the words,
   Who shall ascend into heaven? is the same, as though you should say,
   "Who knows whether the inheritance of eternal and celestial life
   remains for us?" And the words, Who shall descend into the deep? mean
   the same, as though you should say, "Who knows whether the everlasting
   destruction of the soul follows the death of the body?" He teaches us,
   that doubt on those two points is removed by the righteousness of
   faith; for the one would draw down Christ from heaven, and the other
   would bring him up again from death. Christ's ascension into heaven
   ought indeed fully to confirm our faith as to eternal life; for he in a
   manner removes Christ himself from the possession of heaven, who doubts
   whether the inheritance of heaven is prepared for the faithful, in
   whose name, and on whose account he has entered thither. Since in like
   manner he underwent the horrors of hell to deliver us from them, to
   doubt whether the faithful are still exposed to this misery, is to
   render void, and, as it were, to deny his death.

   8. What does it say? [324] For the purpose of removing the impediments
   of faith, he has hitherto spoken negatively: but now in order to show
   the way of obtaining righteousness, he adopts an affirmative mode of
   speaking. Though the whole might have been announced in one continuous
   sentence, yet a question is interposed for the sake of exciting
   attention: and his object at the same time was to show how great is the
   difference between the righteousness of the law and that of the gospel;
   for the one, showing itself at a distance, restrains all men from
   coming nigh; but the other, offering itself at hand, kindly invites us
   to a fruition of itself, Nigh thee is the word

   It must be further observed, that lest the minds of men, being led away
   by crafts, should wander from the way of salvation, the limits of the
   word are prescribed to them, within which they are to keep themselves:
   for it is the same as though he had bidden them to be satisfied with
   the word only, and reminded them, that in this mirror those secrets of
   heaven are to be seen, which would otherwise by their brightness dazzle
   their eyes, and would also stun their ears and overpower the mind
   itself.

   Hence the faithful derive from this passage remarkable consolation with
   regard to the certainty of the word; for they may no less safely rest
   on it, than on what is actually present. It must also be noticed, that
   the word, by which we have a firm and calm trust as to our salvation,
   had been set forth even by Moses:

   This is the word of faith. Rightly does Paul take this as granted; for
   the doctrine of the law does by no means render the conscience quiet
   and calm, nor supply it with what ought to satisfy it. He does not,
   however, exclude other parts of the word, no, not even the precepts of
   the law; but his design is, to show that remission of sins stands for
   righteousness, even apart from that strict obedience which the law
   demands. Sufficient then for pacifying minds, and for rendering certain
   our salvation, is the word of the gospel; in which we are not commanded
   to earn righteousness by works, but to embrace it, when offered
   gratuitously, by faith.

   The word of faith is to be taken for the word of promise, that is, for
   the gospel itself, because it bears a relation to faith. [325] The
   contrast, by which the difference between the law and the gospel
   appears, is indeed to be understood: and from this distinction we
   learn, -- that as the law demands works, so the gospel requires nothing
   else, but that men bring faith to receive the grace of God. The words,
   which we preach, are added, that no one might have the suspicion that
   Paul differed from Moses; for he testifies, that in the ministration of
   the gospel there was complete consent between him and Moses; inasmuch
   as even Moses placed our felicity in nothing else but in the gratuitous
   promise of divine favor.

   9. That if thou wilt confess, etc. Here is also an allusion, rather
   than a proper and strict quotation: for it is very probable that Moses
   used the word mouth, by taking a part for the whole, instead of the
   word face, or sight. But it was not unsuitable for the Apostle to
   allude to the word mouth, in this manner: -- "Since the Lord sets his
   word before our face, no doubt he calls upon us to confess it." For
   wherever the word of the Lord is, it ought to bring forth fruit; and
   the fruit is the confession of the mouth.

   By putting confession before faith, he changes the order, which is
   often the case in Scripture: for the order would have been more regular
   if the faith of the heart had preceded, and the confession of the
   mouth, which arises from it, had followed. [326] But he rightly
   confesses the Lord Jesus, who adorns him with his own power,
   acknowledging him to be such an one as he is given by the Father, and
   described in the gospel.

   Express mention is made only of Christ's resurrection; which must not
   be so taken, as though his death was of no moment, but because Christ,
   by rising again, completed the whole work of our salvation: for though
   redemption and satisfaction were effected by his death, through which
   we are reconciled to God; yet the victory over sin, death, and Satan
   was attained by his resurrection; and hence also came righteousness,
   newness of life, and the hope of a blessed immortality. And thus is
   resurrection alone often set before us as the assurance of our
   salvation, not to draw away our attention from his death, but because
   it bears witness to the efficacy and fruit of his death: in short, his
   resurrection includes his death. On this subject we have briefly
   touched in [5]the sixth chapter.

   It may be added, that Paul requires not merely an historical faith, but
   he makes the resurrection itself its end. For we must remember the
   purpose for which Christ rose again; -- it was the Father's design in
   raising him, to restore us all to life: for though Christ had power of
   himself to reassume his soul, yet this work is for the most part
   ascribed in Scripture to God the Father.

   10. For with the heart we believe [327] unto righteousness, etc. This
   passage may help us to understand what justification by faith is; for
   it shows that righteousness then comes to us, when we embrace God's
   goodness offered to us in the gospel. We are then for this reason just,
   because we believe that God is propitious to us in Christ. But let us
   observe this, -- that the seat of faith is not in the head, (in cerebro
   -- in the brain,) but in the heart. Yet I would not contend about the
   part of the body in which faith is located: but as the word heart is
   often taken for a serious and sincere feeling, I would say that faith
   is a firm and effectual confidence, (fiducia -- trust, dependence,) and
   not a bare notion only.

   With the mouth confession is made unto salvation It may seem strange,
   that he ascribes no part of our salvation to faith, as he had before so
   often testified, that we are saved by faith alone. But we ought not on
   this account to conclude that confession is the cause of our salvation.
   His design was only to show how God completes our salvation, even when
   he makes faith, which he implants in our hearts, to show itself by
   confession: nay, his simple object was, to mark out true faith, as that
   from which this fruit proceeds, lest any one should otherwise lay claim
   to the empty name of faith alone: for it ought so to kindle the heart
   with zeal for God's glory, as to force out its own flame. And surely,
   he who is justified has already obtained salvation: hence he no less
   believes with the heart unto salvation, than with the mouth makes a
   confession. You see that he has made this distinction, -- that he
   refers the cause of justification to faith, -- and that he then shows
   what is necessary to complete salvation; for no one can believe with
   the heart without confessing with the mouth: it is indeed a necessary
   consequence, but not that which assigns salvation to confession.

   But let them see what answer they can give to Paul, who at this day
   proudly boast of some sort of imaginary faith, which, being content
   with the secrecy of the heart, neglect the confession of the mouth, as
   a matter superfluous and vain; for it is extremely puerile to say, that
   there is fire, when there is neither flame nor heat.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [322] Righteousness is here personified, according to the usual manner
   of the Apostle: law and sin had before been represented in the same
   way. -- Ed.

   [323] It seems not necessary to have recourse to the distinctions made
   in the foregoing section. The character of the quotation given is
   correctly described in the words of Chrysostom, as quoted by Poole,
   "Paulus ea transtulit et aptavit ad jusitiam fidei -- Paul transferred
   and accommodated these things to the righteousness of faith." He
   evidently borrowed the words of Moses, not literally, but
   substantially, for the purpose of setting forth the truth he was
   handling. The speaker is not Moses, but "the righteousness of faith,"
   represented as a person. Luther, as quoted by Wolfius, says, that
   "Paul, under the influence of the Spirit, took from Moses the occasion
   to form, as it were, a new and a suitable text against the
   justiciaries." It appears to be an application, by way of analogy, of
   the words of Moses to the gospel; but Pareus, Wolfius, Turrettin, and
   Doddridge, consider the words as applied by way of accommodation. --
   Ed.

   [324] "The righteousness of faith" is evidently the "it" in this
   question: See Romans 10:6. -- Ed.

   [325] It is "the word" which requires "faith," and is received by
   faith; or it is the word entitled to faith, worthy of being believed;
   or it is the word which generates and supports faith. -- Ed.

   [326] "He puts mouth' before heart,'" says Pareus, "for he follows the
   order in which they are given by Moses, and for this reason, because we
   know not faith otherwise than by profession." This is one of the many
   instances both in the New and Old Testament, in which the most apparent
   act is mentioned first, and then the most hidden, or in which the deed
   is stated first, and then the principle from which it proceeds. See
   Romans 13:13; Romans 15:13. And we have here another instance of the
   Apostle's style; he reverses the order in Romans 10:10, mentioning
   faith first, and confession last. The two verses may be thus rendered,
   -- 9. That if thou wilt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,^
   And believe in thine heart that God raised him from the dead,^
   Thou shalt be saved. 10. For with the heart we believe unto
   righteousness,^
   And with the mouth we confess unto salvation. He begins and ends with
   confession, and in the middle clauses he mentions faith. -- Ed.

   [327] "Creditur;" pisteuetai, "it is believed." It is an impersonal
   verb, and so is the verb in the next clause. The introduction of a
   person is necessary in a version, and we may say, "We believe;" or, as
   "thou" is used in the preceding verse, it may be adopted here, -- "For
   by the heart thou believest unto righteousness," i.e., in order to
   attain righteousness; "and with the mouth thou confessest unto
   salvation," i.e., in order to attain salvation. "God knows our faith,"
   as Pareus observes, "but it is made known to man by confession."
   Turrettin's remarks on this verse are much to the purpose. He says,
   that Paul loved antitheses, and that we are not to understand faith and
   confession as separated and applied only to the two things here
   mentioned, but ought to be viewed as connected, and that a similar
   instance is found in Romans 9:25, where Christ is said to have been
   delivered for our offenses, and to have risen again for our
   justification; which means, that by his death and resurrection our
   offenses are blotted out, and justification is obtained. In the same
   manner the import of what is here said is, that by sincere faith and
   open confession we obtain justification and salvation. -- Ed.

   Romans 10:11-13

   11. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be
   ashamed.

   11. Dicit enim scriptura, omnis qui credit in eum non pudefiet:

   12. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the
   same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

   12. Non enim est distinctio Iudaei et Graeci; unus enim Dominus omnium,
   dives in omnes qui invocant eum;

   13. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

   13. Quisquis enim invocaverit nomen Domini salvus erit.

   11. For the Scripture saith, etc. Having stated the reasons why God had
   justly repudiated the Jews, he returns to prove the calling of the
   Gentiles, which is the other part of the question which he is
   discussing. As then he had explained the way by which men obtain
   salvation, and one that is common and opened to the Gentiles no less
   than to the Jews, he now, having first hoisted an universal banner,
   extends it expressly to the Gentiles, and then invites the Gentiles by
   name to it: and he repeats the testimony which he had before adduced
   from Isaiah, that what he said might have more authority, and that it
   might also be evident, how well the prophecies concerning Christ
   harmonize with the law. [328]

   12. For there is no distinction, etc. Since faith alone is required,
   wherever it is found, there the goodness of God manifests itself unto
   salvation: there is then in this case no difference between one people
   or nation and another. And he adds the strongest of reasons; for since
   he who is the Creator and Maker of the whole world is the God of all
   men, he will show himself kind to all who will acknowledge and call on
   him as their God: for as his mercy is infinite, it cannot be but that
   it will extend itself to all by whom it shall be sought.

   Rich is to be taken here in an active sense, as meaning kind and
   bountiful. [329] And we may observe, that the wealth of our Father is
   not diminished by his liberality; and that therefore it is not made
   less for us, with whatever multiplied affluence of his grace he may
   enrich others. There is then no reason why some should envy the
   blessings of others, as though anything were thereby lost by them.

   But though this reason is sufficiently strong, he yet strengthens it by
   the testimony of the Prophet Joel; which, according to the general term
   that is used, includes all alike. But readers can see much better by
   the context, that what Joel declares harmonizes with the present
   subject; for he prophesies in that passage of the kingdom of Christ:
   and further, after having said, that the wrath of God would burn in a
   dreadful manner, in the midst of his ardor, he promises salvation to
   all who would call on the name of the Lord. It hence follows, that the
   grace of God penetrates into the abyss of death, if only it be sought
   there; so that it is not by any means to be withheld from the Gentiles.
   [330]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [328] As in Romans 11:33, the Apostle quotes from the Septuagint; for
   to "make haste," as the Hebrew is, conveys the same idea as "to be
   ashamed:" for he who hastens, acts for the most part foolishly and
   brings himself to shame, as Saul did, when he did not wait for Samuel,
   but hastened to sacrifice, and thereby brought shame on himself. -- Ed.

   [329] "Pro benigno et benefico:" the word "rich," is rather to be taken
   as meaning one who possesses abundance, or an exuberance of things, and
   here, of gifts and blessings, of mercy and grace to pardon, to cleanse,
   and to endow with spiritual privileges. -- Ed.

   [330] The passage referred to is in Joel 2:32. It is taken verbatim
   from the Septuagint; and it is literally according to the Hebrew,
   except that the last verb mlt, in that language, means to be set free,
   rescued, or delivered, rather than to be saved; but the idea is nearly
   the same. -- Ed.

   Romans 10:14-17

   14. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and
   how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how
   shall they hear without a preacher?

   14. Quomodo ergo invocabunt eum in quem non crediderint? quomodo vero
   in eum credent de quo non audiverint? quomodo autem audient absque
   praedicante?

   15. And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
   How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and
   bring glad tidings of good things!

   15. Quomodo autem praedicabunt nisi mittantur? Quemadmodum scriptum
   est, Quam pulchri pedes annuntiantium pacem, annuntiantium bona!

   16. But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord,
   who hath believed our report?

   16. Sed non omnes obedierunt evangelio; Iesaias enim dicit, Domine,
   quis credidit sermoni nostro?

   17. So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

   17. Ergo fides ex auditu, auditus autem per verbum Dei.

   I shall not engage the reader long in reciting and disproving the
   opinions of others. Let every one have his own view; and let me be
   allowed to bring forward what I think. That you may then understand the
   design of this gradation, bear in mind first, that there was a mutual
   connection between the calling of the Gentiles and the ministry of
   Paul, which he exercised among them; so that on the evidence for the
   one depended the evidence for the other. It was now necessary for Paul
   to prove, beyond a doubt, the calling of the Gentiles, and, at the same
   time, to give a reason for his own ministry, lest he should seem to
   extend the favor of God without authority, to withhold from the
   children the bread intended for them by God, and to bestow it on dogs.
   But these things he therefore clears up at the same time.

   But how he connects the thread of his discourse, will not be fully
   understood, until every part be in order explained. The import of what
   he advances is the same as though he had said, "Both Jews and Gentiles,
   by calling on the name of God, do thereby declare that they believe on
   him; for a true calling on God's name cannot be except a right
   knowledge of him were first had. Moreover, faith is produced by the
   word of God, but the word of God is nowhere preached, except through
   God's special providence and appointment. Where then there is a calling
   on God, there is faith; and where faith is, the seed of the word has
   preceded; where there is preaching there is the calling of God. Now
   where his calling is thus efficacious and fruitful, there is there a
   clear and indubitable proof of the divine goodness. It will hence at
   last appear, that the Gentiles are not to be excluded from the kingdom
   of God, for God has admitted them into a participation of his
   salvation. For as the cause of faith among them is the preaching of the
   gospel, so the cause of preaching is the mission of God, by which it
   had pleased him in this manner to provide for their salvation." We
   shall now consider each portion by itself.

   14. How shall they call? etc. Paul intends here to connect prayer with
   faith, as they are indeed things most closely connected, for he who
   calls on God betakes himself, as it were, to the only true haven of
   salvation, and to a most secure refuge; he acts like the son, who
   commits himself into the bosom of the best and the most loving of
   fathers, that he may be protected by his care, cherished by his
   kindness and love, relieved by his bounty, and supported by his power.
   This is what no man can do who has not previously entertained in his
   mind such a persuasion of God's paternal kindness towards him, that he
   dares to expect everything from him.

   He then who calls on God necessarily feels assured that there is
   protection laid up for him; for Paul speaks here of that calling which
   is approved by God. Hypocrites also pray, but not unto salvation; for
   it is with no conviction of faith. It hence appears how completely
   ignorant are all the schoolmen, who doubtingly present themselves
   before God, being sustained by no confidence. Paul thought far
   otherwise; for he assumes this as an acknowledged axiom, that we cannot
   rightly pray unless we are surely persuaded of success. For he does not
   refer here to hesitating faith, but to that certainty which our minds
   entertain respecting his paternal kindness, when by the gospel he
   reconciles us to himself, and adopts us for his children. By this
   confidence only we have access to him, as we are also taught in
   Ephesians 3:12.

   But, on the other hand, learn that true faith is only that which brings
   forth prayer to God; for it cannot be but that he who has tasted the
   goodness of God will ever by prayer seek the enjoyment of it.

   How shall they believe on him? etc. The meaning is, that we are in a
   manner mute until God's promise opens our mouth to pray, and this is
   the order which he points out by the Prophet, when he says, "I will say
   to them, my people are ye;" and they shall say to me, "Thou art our
   God." (Zechariah 13:9.) It belongs not indeed to us to imagine a God
   according to what we may fancy; we ought to possess a right knowledge
   of him, such as is set forth in his word. And when any one forms an
   idea of God as good, according to his own understanding, it is not a
   sure nor a solid faith which he has, but an uncertain and evanescent
   imagination; it is therefore necessary to have the word, that we may
   have a right knowledge of God. No other word has he mentioned here but
   that which is preached, because it is the ordinary mode which the Lord
   has appointed for conveying his word. But were any on this account to
   contend that God cannot transfer to men the knowledge of himself,
   except by the instrumentality of preaching, we deny that to teach this
   was the Apostle's intention; for he had only in view the ordinary
   dispensation of God, and did not intend to prescribe a law for the
   distribution of his grace.

   15. How shall they preach except they be sent? etc. He intimates that
   it is a proof and a pledge of divine love when any nation is favored
   with the preaching of the gospel; and that no one is a preacher of it,
   but he whom God has raised up in his special providence, and that hence
   there is no doubt but that he visits that nation to whom the gospel is
   proclaimed. But as Paul does not treat here of the lawful call of any
   one, it would be superfluous to speak at large on the subject. It is
   enough for us to bear this only in mind, that the gospel does not fall
   like rain from the clouds, but is brought by the hands of men wherever
   it is sent from above.

   As it is written, How beautiful, etc. We are to apply this testimony to
   our present subject in this manner, The Lord, when he gave hope of
   deliverance to his people, commended the advent of those who brought
   the glad tidings of peace, by a remarkable eulogy; by this very
   circumstance he has made it evident that the apostolic ministry was to
   be held in no less esteem, by which the message of eternal life is
   brought to us. And it hence follows, that it is from God, since there
   is nothing in the world that is an object of desire and worthy of
   praise, which does not proceed from his hand. [331]

   But hence we also learn how much ought all good men to desire, and how
   much they ought to value the preaching of the gospel, which is thus
   commended to us by the mouth of the Lord himself. Nor is there indeed a
   doubt, but that God has thus highly spoken of the incomparable value of
   this treasure, for the purpose of awakening the minds of all, so that
   they may anxiously desire it. Take feet, by metonymy, for coming. [332]

   16. But all have not obeyed the gospel, etc. This belongs not to the
   argument, which Paul designed to follow in the gradation he lays down;
   nor does he refer to it in the conclusion which immediately follows. It
   was yet expedient for Paul to introduce the sentence here, in order to
   anticipate an objection, lest any one should build an argument on what
   he had said, -- that the word in order always precedes faith, as the
   seed the corn, -- and draw this inference, that faith everywhere
   follows the word: for Israel, who had never been without the word,
   might have made a boast of this kind. It was therefore necessary, that,
   in passing, he should give them this intimation, -- that many are
   called, who are yet not chosen.

   He also quotes a passage from Isaiah 53:1; where the Prophet, before he
   proceeds to announce a remarkable prediction respecting the death and
   the kingdom of Christ, speaks with astonishment of the few number of
   believers, who appeared to him in the Spirit to be so few, that he was
   constrained to exclaim, "O Lord, who has believed our report?" that is,
   the word which we preach. For though in Hebrew the term smvh, shimuoe,
   means passively a word, [333] yet the Greeks have rendered it, akoen --
   hearing, and the Latins, auditum -- hearing; incorrectly indeed, but
   with no ambiguity in the meaning.

   We now see why this exception was by the way introduced; it was, that
   no one might suppose that faith necessarily follows where there is
   preaching. He however does afterwards point out the reason, by saying,
   "To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" by which he intimates
   that there is no benefit from the word, except when God shines in us by
   the light of his Spirit; and thus the inward calling, which alone is
   efficacious and peculiar to the elect, is distinguished from the
   outward voice of men. It is hence evident, how foolishly some maintain,
   that all are indiscriminately the elect, because the doctrine of
   salvation is universal, and because God invites all indiscriminately to
   himself. But the generality of the promises does not alone and by
   itself make salvation common to all: on the contrary, the peculiar
   revelation, mentioned by the Prophet, confines it to the elect.

   17. Faith then is by hearing, etc. We see by this conclusion what Paul
   had in view by the gradation which he formed; it was to show, that
   wherever faith is, God has there already given an evidence of his
   election; and then, that he, by pouring his blessing on the
   ministration of the gospel, to illuminate the minds of men by faith,
   and thereby to lead them to call on his name, had thus testified, that
   the Gentiles were admitted by him into a participation of the eternal
   inheritance.

   And this is a remarkable passage with regard to the efficacy of
   preaching; for he testifies, that by it faith is produced. He had
   indeed before declared, that of itself it is of no avail; but that when
   it pleases the Lord to work, it becomes the instrument of his power.
   And indeed the voice of man can by no means penetrate into the soul;
   and mortal man would be too much exalted, were he said to have the
   power to regenerate us; the light also of faith is something sublimer
   than what can be conveyed by man: but all these things are no
   hindrances, that God should not work effectually through the voice of
   man, so as to create faith in us through his ministry.

   It must be further noticed, that faith is grounded on nothing else but
   the truth of God; for Paul does not teach us that faith springs from
   any other kind of doctrine, but he expressly restricts it to the word
   of God; and this restriction would have been improper if faith could
   rest on the decrees of men. Away then with all the devices of men when
   we speak of the certainty of faith. Hence also the Papal conceit
   respecting implicit faith falls to the ground, because it tears away
   faith from the word; and more detestable still is that blasphemy, that
   the truth of the word remains suspended until the authority of the
   Church establishes it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [331] "This prophecy," say Gomarus, "has not two meanings -- the proper
   and the allegorical, as the Papists foolishly assert, but two
   fulfillments; the first when heralds announced the return of the people
   from Babylon to their own country; and the second, (shadowed forth by
   the first as its destined type,) when the heralds of the gospel
   announced and proclaimed its tidings to the world." -- Ed.

   [332] This passage is taken from Isaiah 52:7. This is a striking
   instance that the Apostle quotes not from the Septuagint, when that
   version materially departs from the Hebrew, as is the case here. Though
   it appears to be a version of his own, he yet gives not the original
   literally, but accommodates it to his own purpose: he leaves out "on
   the mountains," and adopts the plural number instead of the singular,
   both as to the participle "announcing" or evangelizing, and as to the
   word "good." The words peace, good, and salvation, in Hebrew, seem to
   refer to the same thing, according to the usual style of the Prophets.
   The words of Paul, as rendered by Calvin, coincide more with the
   Hebrew, than as they are rendered in our common version. The verb
   euangelizo, is often used simply in the sense of announcing,
   publishing, declaring or preaching, as in Luke 3:18; 4:43; Acts 5:42,
   etc.; and in this sense it exactly corresponds with vsr, which means
   the same, though the other idea of the Greek verb, that of
   evangelizing, has been wrongly given to it; for it is applied to the
   announcing of bad as well as of good news. -- Ed.

   [333] Or, what is heard; it being a noun from sm, to hear, in its
   passive sense, it signifies a report, a message, or any tidings
   conveyed to the hearing of men. The Greek word akoe is used in various
   senses, as signifying the act of hearing, Matthew 13:14, -- the faculty
   of hearing, 1 Corinthians 12:17, -- the organ of hearing, the ear, Mark
   7:35, -- and what is heard, a word, a report, as here and in John 12:38
   Schleusner refers to instances in the classics in which the word is
   used in all these meanings. It is not necessary, nor is it in
   accordance with the usual manner of the Apostle, to give the word the
   same meaning in the next verse as in this. It is the practice of the
   Apostle to use the same words in different senses in the same passage.
   See Romans 4:18; Romans 8:24. Here it means what is heard, report; and
   in the following verse, the act, that is, hearing. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 10:18-21

   18. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into
   all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

   18. Sed dico, Nunquid non audierunt? Quinimo, In omnem terram exivit
   sonus eorum, et in fines orbis verba eorum.

   19. But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke
   you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I
   will anger you.

   19. Sed dico, Nunquid non cognovit Israel? Primus Moses dicit, Ego ad
   aemulationem provocabo vos in eo qui non est populus, et in gente
   stulta irritabo vos.

   20. But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought
   me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.

   20. Iesaias autem audet et dicit, Inventus sum a non quaerentibus me,
   conspicuus factus sum iis qui me non interrogabant.

   21. But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
   hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

   21. De Israele autem dicit, Quotidie expandi manus meas ad populum
   contumacem et contradicentem (vel, non credentem.)

   18. But I say, have they not heard? etc. Since the minds of men are
   imbued, by preaching, with the knowledge of God, which leads them to
   call on God, it remained a question whether the truth of God had been
   proclaimed to the Gentiles; for that Paul had suddenly betaken himself
   to the Gentiles, there was by that novelty no small offense given. He
   then asks, whether God had ever before directed his voice to the
   Gentiles, and performed the office of a teacher towards the whole
   world. But in order that he might show that the school, into which God
   collects scholars to himself from any part, is open in common to all,
   he brings forward a Prophet's testimony from Psalm 19:4; which yet
   seems to bear apparently but little on the subject: for the Prophet
   does not speak there of Apostles but of the material works of God; in
   which he says the glory of God shines forth so evidently, that they may
   be said to have a sort of tongue of their own to declare the
   perfections of God.

   This passage of Paul gave occasion to the ancients to explain the whole
   Psalm allegorically, and posterity have followed them: so that, without
   doubt, the sun going forth as a bridegroom from his chamber, was
   Christ, and the heavens were the Apostles. They who had most piety, and
   showed a greater modesty in interpreting Scripture, thought that what
   was properly said of the celestial architecture, has been transferred
   by Paul to the Apostles by way of allusion. But as I find that the
   Lord's servants have everywhere with great reverence explained
   Scripture, and have not turned them at pleasure in all directions, I
   cannot be persuaded, that Paul has in this manner misconstrued this
   passage. I then take his quotation according to the proper and genuine
   meaning of the Prophet; so that the argument will be something of this
   kind, -- God has already from the beginning manifested his divinity to
   the Gentiles, though not by the preaching of men, yet by the testimony
   of his creatures; for though the gospel was then silent among them, yet
   the whole workmanship of heaven and earth did speak and make known its
   author by its preaching. It hence appears, that the Lord, even during
   the time in which he confined the favor of his covenant to Israel, did
   not yet so withdraw from the Gentiles the knowledge of himself, but
   that he ever kept alive some sparks of it among them. He indeed
   manifested himself then more particularly to his chosen people, so that
   the Jews might be justly compared to domestic hearers, whom he
   familiarly taught as it were by his own mouth; yet as he spoke to the
   Gentiles at a distance by the voice of the heavens, he showed by this
   prelude that he designed to make himself known at length to them also.

   But I know not why the Greek interpreter rendered the word qvm, kum,
   phthongon auton, their sound; for it means a line, sometimes in
   building, and sometimes in writing. [334] As it is certain that the
   same thing is mentioned twice in this passage, it seems to me probable,
   that the heavens are introduced as declaring by what is written as it
   were on them, as well as by voice, the power of God; for by the word
   going forth the Prophet reminds us, that the doctrine, of which the
   heavens are the preachers, is not included within the narrow limits of
   one land, but is proclaimed to the utmost regions of the world.

   19. But I say, has not Israel known? This objection of an opponent is
   taken from the comparison of the less with the greater. Paul had
   argued, that the Gentiles were not to be excluded from the knowledge of
   God, since he had from the beginning manifested himself to them, though
   only obscurely and through shadows, or had at least given them some
   knowledge of his truth. What then is to be said of Israel, who had been
   illuminated by a far different light of truth? for how comes it that
   aliens and the profane should run to the light manifested to them afar
   off, and that the holy race of Abraham should reject it when familiarly
   seen by them? For this distinction must be ever borne in mind, "What
   nation is so renowned, that it has gods coming nigh to it, as thy God
   at this day descends to thee?" It was not then without reason asked,
   why knowledge had not followed the doctrine of the law, with which
   Israel was favored.

   First, Moses saith, etc. He proves by the testimony of Moses, that
   there was nothing inconsistent in God in preferring the Gentiles to the
   Jews. The passage is taken from that celebrated song, in which God,
   upbraiding the Jews with their perfidiousness, declares, that he would
   execute vengeance on them, and provoke them to jealousy by taking the
   Gentiles into covenant with himself, because they had departed to
   fictitious gods. "Ye have," he says, "by despising and rejecting me,
   transferred my right and honor to idols: to avenge this wrong, I will
   also substitute the Gentiles in your place, and I will transfer to them
   what I have hitherto given to you." Now this could not have been
   without repudiating the Jewish nation: for the emulation, which Moses
   mentions, arose from this, -- that God formed for himself a nation from
   that which was not a nation, and raised up from nothing a new people,
   who were to occupy the place from which the Jews had been driven away,
   inasmuch as they had forsaken the true God and prostituted themselves
   to idols. For though, at the coming of Christ, the Jews were not gone
   astray to gross and external idolatry, they had yet no excuse, since
   they had profaned the whole worship of God by their inventions; yea,
   they at length denied God the Father, as revealed in Christ, his
   only-begotten Son, which was an extreme kind of impiety.

   Observe, that a foolish nation, and no nation, are the same; for
   without the hope of eternal life men have properly no existence.
   Besides, the beginning or origin of life is from the light of faith:
   hence spiritual existence flows from the new creation; and in this
   sense Paul calls the faithful the work of God, as they are regenerated
   by his Spirit, and renewed after his image. Now from the word foolish,
   we learn that all the wisdom of men, apart from the word of God, is
   mere vanity. [335]

   20. But Isaiah is bold, and says, etc. As this prophecy is somewhat
   clearer, that he might excite greater attention he says that it was
   expressed with great confidence; as though he had said, -- "The Prophet
   did not speak in a figurative language, or with hesitation, but had in
   plain and clear words declared the calling of the Gentiles." But the
   things which Paul has here separated, by interposing a few words, are
   found connected together in the prophet Isaiah 65:1, where the Lord
   declares, that the time would come when he should turn his favor to the
   Gentiles; and he immediately subjoins this reason, -- that he was
   wearied with the perverseness of Israel, which, through very long
   continuance, had become intolerable to him. He then speaks thus, --
   "They who inquired not of me before, and neglected my name, have now
   sought me, (the perfect tense for the future to denote the certainty of
   the prophecy.) [336]

   I know that this whole passage is changed by some Rabbins, as though
   God promised that he would cause that the Jews should repent of their
   defection: but nothing is more clear than that he speaks of aliens; for
   it follows in the same context, -- "I have said, Behold I come to a
   people, on whom my name is not called." Without doubt, then, the
   Prophet declares it as what would take place, that those who were
   before aliens would be received by a new adoption unto the family of
   God. It is then the calling of the Gentiles; and in which appears a
   general representation of the calling of all the faithful; for there is
   no one who anticipates the Lord; but we are all, without exception,
   delivered by his free mercy from the deepest abyss of death, when there
   is no knowledge of him, no desire of serving him, in a word, no
   conviction of his truth.

   21. But of Israel, etc. A reason is subjoined why God passed over to
   the Gentiles; it was because he saw that his favor was become a mockery
   to the Jews. But that readers may more fully understand that the
   blindness of the people is pointed out in the second clause, Paul
   expressly reminds us that the elect people were charged with their own
   wickedness. Literally it is, "He says to Israel;" but Paul has imitated
   the Hebrew idiom; for l, lamed, is often put for mn, men. And he says,
   that to Israel he stretched forth his hands, whom he continually by his
   word invited to himself, and ceased not to allure by every sort of
   kindness; for these are the two ways which he adopts to call men, as he
   thus proves his goodwill towards them. However, he chiefly complains of
   the contempt shown to his truth; which is the more abominable, as the
   more remarkable is the manner by which God manifests his paternal
   solicitude in inviting men by his word to himself.

   And very emphatical is the expression, that he stretches out his hands;
   for by seeking our salvation through the ministers of his word, he
   stretches forth to us his hands no otherwise than as a father who
   stretches forth his arms, ready to receive his son kindly into his
   bosom. And he says daily, that it might not seem strange to any one if
   he was wearied in showing kindness to them, inasmuch as he succeeded
   not by his assiduity. A similar representation we have in Jeremiah
   7:13; and Jeremiah 11:7, where he says that he rose up early to warn
   them.

   Their unfaithfulness is also set forth by two most suitable words. I
   have thought it right to render the participle apeithounta, refractory,
   or rebellious, and yet the rendering of Erasmus and of the Old
   Translator, which I have placed in the margin, is not to be wholly
   disapproved. But since the Prophet accuses the people of perverseness,
   and then adds that they wandered through ways which were not good, I
   doubt not but that the Greek Translator meant to express the Hebrew
   word svrr, surer, by two words, calling them first disobedient or
   rebellious, and then gainsaying; for their contumacy showed itself in
   this, because the people, with untamable pride and bitterness,
   obstinately rejected the holy admonitions of the Prophets. [337]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [334] Intepreters have been very much at a loss to account for this
   difference. The Apostle adopts the rendering of the Septuagint, as
   though the Hebrew word had been qvlm. Though there is no copy, yet
   consulted, that favors this reading, it is yet the probable one; not
   only because the Apostle sanctions it, but it is what the context
   demands, and especially the parallelism which prevails in Hebrew
   poetry. In the next line "words" are mentioned, and "voice" here would
   be the most suitable corresponding term. But we may go back to the
   preceding distich, and find not only a confirmation of this, but also
   an instance of terms being used in the same passage in different
   senses, while yet the meaning is obvious to a common reader, and at the
   same time intricate and puzzling to a critic. The two distichs may be
   thus rendered, -- 4. Without speech, and without words!^
   Not heard is their voice! -- 5. Through all the earth goes forth their
   voice,
   And through the extremity of the world their words. They have no words,
   and yet they have words; they have no voice, and yet they have a voice.
   Here the first and the last line Correspond, and the second and the
   third. There is indeed a different term used for "words" in the last
   line from that which is adopted in the first, but in the first there
   are two, "speech," 'mr, and "words," dvrym, which are expressed by one,
   mlym, in the last. It seems then most probable, that the true reading
   has been retained by the Septuagint The "sound," or voice, as applied
   in this passage, means the report, the news, respecting the gospel; and
   the "words," the actual preaching of it. -- Ed.

   [335] The quotation is from Deuteronomy 32:21, and it is literally the
   Hebrew as well as the Septuagint, except that "you" is put for "them."
   The contrast in Hebrew is very striking; the whole verse is this, --
   21. They have made me jealous by a no-God,^
   They have provoked me by their foolish idols;^
   And I will make them jealous by a no-people,^
   By a foolish nation will I provoke them. -- Ed.

   [336] Isaiah 65:1. The two sentences are reversed; the Septuagint and
   the Hebrew are the same. The reason for changing the order does not
   appear; but it may be observed, that it is an instance common in
   Hebrew, where essentially the same idea is expressed in two successive
   lines, so that it is immaterial which of them is put first. -- Ed.

   [337] The passage is taken from Isaiah 65:2. The Septuagint is
   followed, except that the order of the words in the first part of the
   sentence is changed, thought the Septuagint has preserved the order of
   the original. The version is according to the Hebrew, with the
   exception of the last word, which from its form, the last radical
   letter being doubled, can hardly be expressed in another language by a
   single term, and so the Septuagint has employed two. It means
   "revolting again and again," or willfully revolting. The simple verb
   sr, signifies to turn aside, to revolt, to apostatize: and in a
   reduplicate form, as here, it means either a repeated or an obstinate
   revolt. Indeed the revolt or the apostasy of the Jews was both
   reiterated and perverse, as their history abundantly testifies. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 11
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 11:1-6

   1. I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am
   an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

   1. Dico igitur, Num abjecit Deus populum suum? absit: etenim ego
   Israelita sum, ex genere Abrahae, tribu Benjamin.

   2. God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what
   the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against
   Israel, saying,

   2. Non abjecit Deus populum suum quem praecognovit. An nescitis in Elia
   quid scriptura dicat? quomodo appellet Deum adversus Israel, dicens,

   3. Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars;
   and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

   3. Domine, Prophetas tuas occiderunt, et altaria tua diruerunt, et ego
   relictus sum solus, et quaerunt animam meam.

   4. But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself
   seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.

   4. Sed quid dicit ei oraculum? [338] Reservavi mihi ipsi septem millia
   virorum, qui non flexerunt genu imagini Baal.

   5. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according
   to the election of grace.

   5. Sic ergo et hoc tempore, reliquiae secundum electionem gratiae
   supersunt:

   6. And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no
   more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise
   work is no more work.

   6. Quod si per gratiam, jam non ex operibus; alioqui gratia, jam non
   est gratia: si vero ex operibus, jam non est gratia; alioqui opus, jam
   non est opus.

   1. I say then, etc. What he has hitherto said of the blindness and
   obstinacy of the Jews, might seem to import that Christ at his coming
   had transferred elsewhere the promises of God, and deprived the Jews of
   every hope of salvation. This objection is what he anticipates in this
   passage, and he so modifies what he had previously said respecting the
   repudiation of the Jews, that no one might think that the covenant
   formerly made with Abraham is now abrogated, or that God had so
   forgotten it that the Jews were now so entirely alienated from his
   kingdom, as the Gentiles were before the coming of Christ. All this he
   denies, and he will presently show that it is altogether false. But the
   question is not whether God had justly or unjustly rejected the people;
   for it was proved in the last chapter that when the people, through
   false zeal, had rejected the righteousness of God, they suffered a just
   punishment for their presumption, were deservedly blinded, and were at
   last cut off from the covenant.

   The reason then for their rejection is not now under consideration; but
   the dispute is concerning another thing, which is this, That though
   they deserved such a punishment from God, whether yet the covenant
   which God made formerly with the fathers was abolished. That it should
   fail through any perfidiousness of men, was wholly unreasonable; for
   Paul holds this as a fixed principle, that since adoption is gratuitous
   and based on God alone and not on men, it stands firm and inviolable,
   howsoever great the unfaithfulness of men may be, which may tend to
   abolish it. It was necessary that this knot should be untied, lest the
   truth and election of God should be thought to be dependent on the
   worthiness of men.

   For I am also an Israelite, etc. Before he proceeds to the subject, he
   proves, in passing, by his own example, how unreasonable it was to
   think that the nation was utterly forsaken by God; for he himself was
   in his origin an Israelite, not a proselyte, or one lately introduced
   into the commonwealth of Israel. As then he was justly deemed to be one
   of God's special servants, it was an evidence that God's favor rested
   on Israel. He then assumes the conclusion as proved, which yet he will
   hereafter explain in a satisfactory manner.

   That in addition to the title of an Israelite, he called himself the
   seed of Abraham, and mentioned also his own tribe; this he did that he
   might be counted a genuine Israelite, and he did the same in his
   Epistle to the Philippians, Philippians 3:4. But what some think, that
   it was done to commend God's mercy, inasmuch as Paul sprung from that
   tribe which had been almost destroyed, seems forced and far-fetched.

   2. God has not cast away, etc. This is a negative answer, accompanied
   with a qualifying clause; for had the Apostle unreservedly denied that
   the people were rejected, he would have been inconsistent with himself;
   but by adding a modification, he shows it to be such a rejection, as
   that God's promise is not thereby made void. So the answer may be
   divided into two parts, -- that God has by no means cast away the whole
   race of Abraham, contrary to the tenor of his own covenant, -- and that
   yet the fruit of adoption does not exist in all the children of the
   flesh, for secret election precedes. Thus general rejection could not
   have caused that no seed should be saved; for the visible body of the
   people was in such a manner rejected, that no member of the spiritual
   body of Christ was cut off.

   If any one asks, "Was not circumcision a common symbol of God's favor
   to all the Jews, so that they ought to have been all counted his
   people?" To this the obvious answer is, -- That as outward calling is
   of itself ineffectual without faith, the honor which the unbelieving
   refuse when offered, is justly taken from them. Thus a special people
   remain, in whom God exhibits an evidence of his faithfulness; and Paul
   derives the origin of constancy from secret election. For it is not
   said here that God regards faith, but that he stands to his own
   purpose, so as not to reject the people whom he has foreknown.

   And here again must be noticed what I have before reminded you of, --
   that by the verb foreknow, is not to be understood a foresight, I know
   not what, by which God foresees what sort of being any one will be, but
   that good pleasure, according to which he has chosen those as sons to
   himself, who, being not yet born, could not have procured for
   themselves his favor. [339] So he says to the Galatians, that they had
   been known by God, (Galatians 4:9); for he had anticipated them with
   his favor, so as to call them to the knowledge of Christ. We now
   perceive, that though universal calling may not bring forth fruit, yet
   the faithfulness of God does not fail, inasmuch as he always preserves
   a Church, as long as there are elect remaining; for though God invites
   all people indiscriminately to himself, yet he does not inwardly draw
   any but those whom he knows to be his people, and whom he has given to
   his Son, and of whom also he will be the faithful keeper to the end.

   Know ye not, etc. As there were so few of the Jews who had believed in
   Christ, hardly another conclusion could have been drawn from this small
   number, but that the whole race of Abraham had been rejected; and creep
   in might this thought, -- that in so vast a ruin no sign of God's favor
   appeared: for since adoption was the sacred bond by which the children
   of Abraham were kept collected under the protection of God, it was by
   no means probable, unless that had ceased, that the people should be
   miserably and wretchedly dispersed. To remove this offense, Paul adopts
   a most suitable example; for he relates, that in the time of Elias
   there was such a desolation, that there remained no appearance of a
   Church, and yet, that when no vestige of God's favor appeared, the
   Church of God was, as it were, hid in the grave, and was thus
   wonderfully preserved.

   It hence follows, that they egregiously mistake who form an opinion of
   the Church according to their own perceptions. And surely if that
   celebrated Prophet, who was endued with so enlightened a mind, was so
   deceived, when he attempted by his own judgment to form an estimate of
   God's people, what shall be the case with us, whose highest
   perspicuity, when compared with his, is mere dullness? Let us not then
   determine any thing rashly on this point; but rather let this truth
   remain fixed in our hearts -- that the Church, though it may not appear
   to our eyes, is sustained by the secret providence of God. Let it also
   be remembered by us, that they are foolish and presumptuous who
   calculate the number of the elect according to the extent of their own
   perception: for God has a way, easy to himself, hidden from us, by
   which he wonderfully preserves his elect, even when all things seem to
   us past all remedy.

   And let readers observe this, -- that Paul distinctly compares here,
   and elsewhere, the state of things in his time with the ancient
   condition of the Church, and that it serves in no small degree to
   confirm our faith, when we bear in mind, that nothing happens to us, at
   this day, which the holy Fathers had not formerly experienced: for
   novelty, we know, is a grievous engine to torment weak minds.

   As to the words, In Elias, I have retained the expression of Paul; for
   it may mean either in the history or in the business of Elias; though
   it seems to me more probable, that Paul has followed the Hebrew mode of
   speaking; for v, beth, which is rendered in the Greek by en, in, is
   often taken in Hebrew for of

   How he appeals to God, etc [340] It was certainly a proof how much
   Elias honored the Lord, that for the glory of his name he hesitated not
   to make himself an enemy to his own nation, and to pray for their utter
   ruin, because he thought that the religion and worship of God had
   perished among them: but he was mistaken in charging the whole nation,
   himself alone excepted, with that impiety, for which he wished them to
   be severely visited. There is however in this passage, which Paul
   quotes, no imprecation, but a complaint only: but as he complains in
   such a way as to despair of the whole people, there is no doubt but
   that he gave them up to destruction. Let us then especially notice what
   is said of Elias, which was this, -- that when impiety had everywhere
   prevailed, and overspread almost the whole land, he thought that he was
   left alone.

   I have reserved for myself seven thousand, etc. Though you may take
   this finite for an indefinite number, it was yet the Lord's design to
   specify a large multitude. Since then the grace of God prevails so much
   in an extreme state of things, let us not lightly give over to the
   devil all those whose piety does not openly appear to us. It also ought
   to be fully imprinted on our minds, -- that however impiety may
   everywhere prevail, and dreadful confusion spread on every side, yet
   the salvation of many remains secured under the seal of God. [341] But
   that no one may under this error indulge his own sloth, as many seek
   hiding-places for their vices in the hidden providences of God, it is
   right to observe again, -- that they only are said to be saved who
   continue sound and unpolluted in the faith of God. This circumstance in
   the case ought also to be noticed, -- that those only remained safe who
   did not prostitute their body, no, not even by an external act of
   dissimulation, to the worship of idols; for he not only ascribes to
   them a purity of mind, but that they had also kept their body from
   being polluted by any filthiness of superstition. [342]

   So then also at this time, etc. He applies the example to his own age;
   and to make all things alike, he calls God's people a remnant, that is,
   in comparison with the vast number in whom impiety prevailed: and
   alluding at the same time to the prophecy he had quoted from Isaiah, he
   shows, that in the midst of a miserable and confused desolation the
   faithfulness of God yet shone forth, for there was still some remnant:
   and in order more fully to confirm this, he expressly calls them a
   remnant that survived through the grace of God: and thus he bore
   witness that God's election is unchangeable, according to what the Lord
   said to Elias, -- that where the whole people had fallen away to
   idolatry, he had reserved for himself seven thousand: and hence we
   conclude, that through his kindness they were delivered from
   destruction. Nor does he simply speak of grace; but he now calls our
   attention also to election, that we may learn reverently to rely on the
   hidden purpose of God.

   One thing then that is laid down is, -- that few are saved in
   comparison with the vast number of those who assume the name of being
   God's people; the other is, -- that those are saved by God's power whom
   he has chosen with no regard to any merit. The election of grace is a
   Hebrew idiom for gratuitous election.

   6. If through grace, it is no more by works, etc. This amplification is
   derived from a comparison between things of an opposite character; for
   such is the case between God's grace and the merit of works, that he
   who establishes the one overturns the other.

   But if no regard to works can be admitted in election, without
   obscuring the gratuitous goodness of God, which he designed thereby to
   be so much commended to us, what answer can be given to Paul by those
   infatuated persons, (phrenetici -- insane,) who make the cause of
   election to be that worthiness in us which God has foreseen? For
   whether you introduce works future or past, this declaration of Paul
   opposes you; for he says, that grace leaves nothing to works. Paul
   speaks not here of our reconciliation with God, nor of the means, nor
   of the proximate causes of our salvation; but he ascends higher, even
   to this, -- why God, before the foundation of the world, chose only
   some and passed by others: and he declares, that God was led to make
   this difference by nothing else, but by his own good pleasure; for if
   any place is given to works, so much, he maintains, is taken away from
   grace.

   It hence follows, that it is absurd to blend foreknowledge of works
   with election. For if God chooses some and rejects others, as he has
   foreseen them to be worthy or unworthy of salvation, then the grace of
   God, the reward of works being established, cannot reign alone, but
   must be only in part the cause of our election. For as Paul has
   reasoned before concerning the justification of Abraham, that where
   reward is paid, there grace is not freely bestowed; so now he draws his
   argument from the same fountain, -- that if works come to the account,
   when God adopts a certain number of men unto salvation, reward is a
   matter of debt, and that therefore it is not a free gift. [343]

   Now, though he speaks here of election, yet as it is a general
   reasoning which Paul adopts, it ought to be applied to the whole of our
   salvation; so that we may understand, that whenever it is declared that
   there are no merits of works, our salvation is ascribed to the grace of
   God, or rather, that we may believe that the righteousness of works is
   annihilated, whenever grace is mentioned.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [338] "Oraculum," ho chrematismos, the oracle, the divine response. The
   answer is put for him who gave the answer, for it is "Jehovah" in the
   passage that is quoted; as "Scripture" in Romans 11:2, and in other
   places, means him who speaks in the Scriptures. -- Ed.

   [339] That foreknowledge here includes election or predestination, as
   Augustine maintains, is evident from what follows in verse 5, where
   "the remnant" is said to be reserved "according to the election of
   grace," or gratuitous election. If it be gratuitous, then it cannot be
   according to any foreseen works: and works are expressly excluded in
   Romans 11:6. Were it otherwise, were foreseen works the ground of
   election, there would be no suitableness nor congruity in such terms as
   foreknowledge and election on the subject. It would have been much more
   appropriate in this case for the Apostle to say, "God will receive
   every Jew who will render himself worthy by his works." On this
   supposition there was no necessity for him to go back to election to
   remove the objection which he had stated; he had only to refer to the
   terms of the gospel, which regard Jews and Gentiles without any
   difference. But instead of doing this, which seems adequate to the
   purpose, he gives an answer by referring to the foreknowledge and free
   election of God. There is no way to account for this, except by
   admitting, that election is an efficacious purpose which secures the
   salvation of those who are its objects, who have been chosen in Christ
   before the foundation of the world. -- Ed.

   [340] "Quomodo appellet Deum adversus Israel -- how he appeals to or
   calls on God against Israel;" hos hentunchanei to Theo kata tou Israel;
   "how he solicits (interpellet) God against Israel," Beza; "when he
   pleadeth with God against Israel," Doddridge; "when he complaineth to
   God against Israel," Macknight. To "complain to God against, or, with
   respect to, Israel," would probably be the most suitable rendering. See
   Acts 25:24 The quotation in the following verse is from 1 Kings 19:10,
   and is not taken literally, either from the Hebrew, or from the
   Septuagint. The order of the two first clauses is changed; "prophets,"
   and not "altars," are mentioned first; in these he has adopted the
   words of the Septuagint, but in this clause which follows he has
   changed the terms; instead of kai hupoleleimmai ego monotatos, the
   Apostle has kago hupeleiphthen monos; and he has left out the words,
   "to take it away" after life. The case is similar with the quotation in
   Romans 11:4, from 1 Kings 19:18. The sense is given, but not exactly
   the words, either from the Hebrew or the Septuagint. -- Ed.

   [341] Pareus observes, that these seven thousand had no public
   ministry, for that was idolatrous; and that yet they were preserved by
   such instruction as they derived from the written word. -- Ed.

   [342] Calvin, as some others, has supplied "image" before "Baal," as
   the feminine article tho is by Paul prefixed to it. In the Septuagint
   it is to, and a masculine pronoun is found at the end of the verse in 1
   Kings 19:18, so that it could not have been a female deity, as some
   have supposed. It is indeed evident, especially from a passage in
   Tobit, chapter 1:5, that there was a female deity of this name, but the
   text in Kings will not allow us to regard this goddess to be intended.
   -- Ed.

   [343] The last half of this verse is considered spurious by Griesbach,
   being not found in the greatest number of MSS., nor in the Vulgate, nor
   in the Latin Fathers; but it is found in some of the Greek Fathers,
   Theodoret, Oecumenius, Photius, and in the text, though not in the
   comment of Chrysostom, and in Theophylact, with the exception of the
   last clause, "Otherwise work," etc. The Syriac and Arabic versions also
   contain the whole verse. The argument is complete without the last
   portion, which is, in fact, a repetition of the first in another form.
   But this kind of statement is wholly in unison with the character of
   the Apostle's mode of writing. He often states a thing positively and
   negatively, or in two different ways. See Romans 4:4,5; Romans 9:1;
   Ephesians 2:8,9. Then an omission more probable than an addition. Beza,
   Pareus, Wolfius, etc., regard it as genuine, and Doddridge and
   Macknight have retained it in their versions. Every reason, except the
   number of MSS., is in favor of its genuineness. -- Ed.

   Romans 11:7-10

   7. What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but
   the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded

   7. Quid ergo? Quod quaerit Israel, non est assequutus; [344] electio
   autem assequuta est, reliqui vero excaecati fuerunt;

   8. (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
   slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not
   hear;) unto this day.

   8. Quemadmodum scriptum est, Dedit illis Deus spiritum compunctionis,
   oculos ut non videant, et aures ut non audiant, usque ad hodiernum
   diem.

   9. And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a
   stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

   9. Et David dicit, Fiat mensa eorum in laqueum et in captionem et in
   offendiculum et in retributionem ipsis:

   10. Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down
   their back alway.

   10. Obscurentur oculi eorum ne videant, et dorsum eorum semper incurva.

   7. What then? What Israel seeks, etc. As he is here engaged on a
   difficult subject, he asks a question, as though he was in doubt. He
   intended, however, by expressing this doubt, to render the answer,
   which immediately follows, more evident; for he intimates, that no
   other can be given; and the answer is, -- that Israel in vain labored
   to seek salvation, because his attempt was absurd. Though he mentions
   here no cause, yet as he had expressed it before, he certainly meant it
   to be understood in this place. For his words are the same, as though
   he had said, -- that it ought not to seem strange, that Israel gained
   nothing in striving after righteousness. And hence is proved what he
   presently subjoins concerning election, -- For if Israel has obtained
   nothing by merit, what have others obtained whose case or condition was
   not better? Whence has come so much difference between equals? Who does
   not here see that it is election alone which makes the difference?

   Now the meaning of the word election here is doubtful; for to some it
   seems that it ought to be taken in a collective sense, for the elect
   themselves, that there may be a correspondence between the two clauses.
   Of this opinion I do not disapprove, provided it be allowed that there
   is something more in the word than if he had said, the elect, even
   this, that he intimates that there was no other reason for obtaining
   their election, as though he said, -- "They are not those who strive by
   relying on merits, but those whose salvation depends on the gratuitous
   election of God." For he distinctly compares with the whole of Israel,
   or body of the people, the remnant which was to be saved by God's
   grace. It hence follows, that the cause of salvation exists not in men,
   but depends on the good pleasure of God alone.

   And the rest have been blinded [345] As the elect alone are delivered
   by God's grace from destruction, so all who are not elected must
   necessarily remain blinded. For what Paul means with regard to the
   reprobate is, -- that the beginning of their ruin and condemnation is
   from this -- that they are forsaken by God.

   The quotations which he adduces, collected from various parts of
   Scripture, and not taken from one passage, do seem, all of them, to be
   foreign to his purpose, when you closely examine them according to
   their contexts; for you will find that in every passage, blindness and
   hardening are mentioned as scourges, by which God punished crimes
   already committed by the ungodly; but Paul labors to prove here, that
   not those were blinded, who so deserved by their wickedness, but who
   were rejected by God before the foundation of the world.

   You may thus briefly untie this knot, -- that the origin of the impiety
   which provokes God's displeasure, is the perversity of nature when
   forsaken by God. Paul therefore, while speaking of eternal reprobation,
   has not without reason referred to those things which proceed from it,
   as fruit from the tree or river from the fountain. The ungodly are
   indeed, for their sins, visited by God's judgment with blindness; but
   if we seek for the source of their ruin, we must come to this, -- that
   being accursed by God, they cannot by all their deeds, sayings, and
   purposes, get and obtain any thing but a curse. Yet the cause of
   eternal reprobation is so hidden from us, that nothing remains for us
   but to wonder at the incomprehensible purpose of God, as we shall at
   length see by the conclusion. But they reason absurdly who, whenever a
   word is said of the proximate causes, strive, by bringing forward
   these, to cover the first, which is hid from our view; as though God
   had not, before the fall of Adam, freely determined to do what seemed
   good to him with respect to the whole human race on this account, --
   because he condemns his corrupt and depraved seed, and also, because he
   repays to individuals the reward which their sins have deserved. [346]

   8. Given them has God, etc. There is no doubt, I think, but that the
   passage quoted here from Isaiah is that which Luke refers to in Acts,
   as quoted from him, only the words are somewhat altered. Nor does he
   record here what we find in the Prophet, but only collects from him
   this sentiment, -- that they were imbued from above with the spirit of
   maliciousness, so that they continued dull in seeing and hearing. The
   Prophet was indeed bidden to harden the heart of the people: but Paul
   penetrates to the very fountain, -- that brutal stupor seizes on all
   the senses of men, after they are given up to this madness, so that
   they excite themselves by virulent stimulants against the truth. For he
   does not call it the spirit of giddiness, but of compunction, when the
   bitterness of gall shows itself; yea, when there is also a fury in
   rejecting the truth. And he declares, that by the secret judgment of
   God the reprobate are so demented, that being stupified, they are
   incapable of forming a judgment; for when it is said, that by seeing
   they see nothing, the dullness of their senses is thereby intimated.
   [347]

   Then Paul himself adds, to this very day, lest any one should object
   and say, that this prophecy had been formerly fulfilled, and that it
   was therefore absurd to apply it to the time of the gospel: this
   objection he anticipates, by subjoining, that it was not only a
   blindness of one day, which is described, but that it had continued,
   together with the unhealable obstinacy of the people, to the coming of
   Christ. [348]

   9. And David says, etc. In this testimony of David there is also made
   some change in the words, but it is not what changes the meaning. For
   he thus speaks, "Let their table before them become a snare, and their
   peaceful things a trap;" there is no mention of retribution. As to the
   main point there is sufficient agreement. The Prophet prays, that
   whatever is desirable and happy in life might turn out to the ruin and
   destruction of the ungodly; and this is what he means by table and
   peaceful things. [349] He then gives them up to blindness of spirit and
   weakening of strength; the one of which he expresses by the darkening
   of the eyes, and the other by the incurvation of the back. But that
   this should be extended almost to the whole nation, is not to be
   wondered at; for we know, that not only the chief men were incensed
   against David, but that the common people were also opposed to him. It
   appears plain, that what is read in that passage was not applied to a
   few, but to a large number; yea, when we consider of whom David was a
   type, there appears to be a spiritual import in the opposite clause.
   [350]

   Seeing then that this imprecation remains for all the adversaries of
   Christ, -- that their meat shall be converted into poison, (as we see
   that the gospel is to be the savor of death unto death,) let us embrace
   with humility and trembling the grace of God. We may add, that since
   David speaks of the Israelites, who descended according to the flesh
   from Abraham, Paul fitly applies his testimony to the subject in hand,
   that the blindness of the majority of the people might not appear new
   or unusual.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [344] Literally it is, "what Israel seeks, this he has not obtained."
   The pronoun for "this," toutou Griesbach has displaced, and introduced
   touto in its stead, as the most approved reading. -- Ed.

   [345] "Excaecati fuerunt," eporothesan; it means hardened, stupified,
   rendered callous or obdurate. Occalluerunt -- "were hardened," Beza;
   both Macknight and Doddridge render it, "blinded." It is applied to the
   heart in Mark 6:52; 8:17; John 12:40, -- to the mind in 2 Corinthians
   3:14. -- Ed.

   [346] The foregoing reasoning is not satisfactory: it goes beyond the
   evident meaning of the Apostle. He no doubt quoted the texts according
   to their original design, and to say he did not is to assert what is
   incapable of being proved, and what is even contrary to the Apostle's
   reasoning throughout. The hardening or blinding spoken of by the
   Prophets, is stated uniformly as a punishment for previous unbelief and
   impenitence, as admitted by our author himself, and the obvious fact as
   to the Jews in the Apostle's days, was an evidence of the same, and
   though he states not this fact here, he states it in the sequel of this
   Epistle. But why some were hardened, and others were softened, is what
   must be resolved altogether to the will of God. This, and no more than
   this, is what the Apostle evidently teaches here: and it is neither
   wise nor right to go beyond what is expressly taught, especially on a
   subject of a nature so mysterious and incomprehensible. -- Ed.

   [347] The quotation in this verse is taken from two passages: the first
   clause is from Isaiah 29:10, and the rest from Isaiah 6:9, or
   Deuteronomy 29:4. The first clause is not exactly according to the
   Hebrew or the Septuagint; instead of "God gave them," etc., it is in
   the Septuagint, "the Lord hath made you drink," etc., and in Hebrew,
   "Jehovah has poured upon you," etc. It is the "spirit of slumber" in
   both, or rather, "of deep sleep" -- trdmh, a dead or an overwhelming
   sleep; and katanuxis, though not as to its primary sense the same, is
   yet used according to this meaning. The verb means to puncture, to
   prick, either with grief or remorse, and also to affect with stupor.
   The latter idea the noun must have in this place, for the Hebrew does
   not admit of the other. The latter part is found in substance, though
   not in the same form of words in the two places referred to. -- Ed.

   [348] Some consider this passage as taken from Deuteronomy 29:4, and
   regard the last words as part of the quotation. -- Ed.

   [349] Grotius understands by "table" guests, or friends, who partake of
   the provisions spread on the table. The wish is, that these should be a
   snare, etc. "Table," according to Pareus, means luxury or festivity:
   and he adds, that there are here three metaphors, -- the ensnaring of
   birds -- the entrapping of wild beasts -- and the stumbling in the
   dark, or that of blind men. Then the recompense or retaliation implies,
   that this evil of being ensnared and entrapped, and of stumbling, are
   only just retaliations for similar acts on their part; as they had
   ensnared, entrapped, and caused others to stumble, it was but just that
   they should be treated in the same way. And if we take "table" as a
   metonymy for friends or guests, the meaning would be very striking. And
   we know that the very friends and confederates of the Jews became their
   enemies and effected their ruin. See Jeremiah 38:22. The subject of
   imprecations is attended with some difficulty. To imprecate, or to
   pronounce a curse on others, or to wish others accursed, was forbidden
   even under the law, and it is expressly forbidden under the gospel,
   Matthew 5:45; Romans 12:14; we have the example of our Savior praying
   for his enemies even on the cross; and yet we find that God pronounced
   a curse on all the transgressors of the law, Deuteronomy 27:26, -- that
   Christ pronounced a curse on Chorazin and Bethsaida, -- that the
   Psalmist often imprecated vengeance on his enemies, Psalm 5:10; Psalm
   109:7-15, -- that the Apostle cursed Alexander the coppersmith, 2
   Timothy 4:14, -- and that John bids us not to pray for him who sins the
   sin unto death, 1 John 5:16. The truth is, that circumstances make the
   difference; what is forbidden in one respect is allowed in another. The
   rule to man is, not to curse, but to bless, except to pronounce on
   God's enemies as such the judgment which God has already denounced on
   them. But to curse individuals is what no one is allowed to do, except
   he be inspired so as to know who those are who are given up by God to
   final judgment; which may be supposed to have been the case with the
   Psalmist and with St. Paul. -- Ed.

   [350] Psalm 69:22,23. The passage is given as in the Septuagint, except
   that kai eis theran is added, and the two following words are
   transposed, with autois put after them, and antapodoma is put for
   antapodosin Romans 11:10 is given without any variation from the
   Septuagint. The Hebrew is in words considerably different, and more so
   in our version than it really is. The word, slvmym, is improperly
   rendered "welfare," while it ought to be "recompenses," or, according
   to Tremelius and Bp. Horseley, "retributions," or "retribution." See
   Isaiah 34:8. The last clause of Romans 11:10, though in meaning the
   same, is yet wholly different in words from the Hebrew, which is thus
   correctly rendered in our version, "and make their loins continually to
   shake." The idea in both instances is the taking away of vigor and
   strength. -- Ed.

   Romans 11:11-15

   11. I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid:
   but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for
   to provoke them to jealousy.

   11. Dico igitur, Num impegerunt ut corruerent? Absit: sed eorum lapsu
   salus contigit gentibus in hoc, ut ipsi ad aemulationem provocarentur.

   12. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
   diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their
   fulness?

   12. Si vero eorum lapsus divitiae sunt mundi, et imminutio eorum
   divitiae gentium, quanto magis complementum ipsorum?

   13. For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the
   Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

   13. Vobis enim dico gentibus, quatenus certe ego gentium sum Apostolus,
   ministerium meum illustror,

   14. If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh,
   and might save some of them.

   14. Si quomodo ad aemulationem provocavero carnem meam, et aliquos ex
   ea salvos fecero:

   15. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,
   what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?

   15. Si enim rejectio eorum, reconciliatio est mundi, quid assumptio
   nisi vita ex mortius?

   11. Have they stumbled, etc. You will be greatly hindered in
   understanding this argument, except you take notice, that the Apostle
   speaks sometimes of the whole nation of the Jews, and sometimes of
   single individuals; for hence arises the diversity, that one while he
   speaks of the Jews as being banished from the kingdom of God, cut off
   from the tree and precipitated by God's judgment into destruction, and
   that at another he denies that they had fallen from grace, but that on
   the contrary they continued in the possession of the covenant, and had
   a place in the Church of God.

   It is then in conformity with this difference that he now speaks; for
   since the Jews for the most part rejected Christ, so that perverseness
   had taken hold almost on the whole nation, and few among them seemed to
   be of a sane mind, he asks the question, whether the Jewish nation had
   so stumbled at Christ, that it was all over with them universally, and
   that no hope of repentance remained. Here he justly denies that the
   salvation of the Jews was to be despaired of, or that they were so
   rejected by God, that there was to be no future restoration, or that
   the covenant of grace, which he had once made with them, was entirely
   abolished, since there had ever remained in that nation the seed of
   blessing. That we are so to understand his meaning is evident from
   this, -- that having before connected a sure ruin with blindness, he
   now gives a hope of rising again; which two things are wholly
   different. They then, who perversely stumbled at Christ, fell and fell
   into destruction; yet the nation itself had not fallen, so that he who
   is a Jew must necessarily perish or be alienated from God.

   But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, etc. The Apostle
   asserts two things in this place, -- that the fall of the Jews had
   turned out for salvation to the Gentiles; but to this end -- that they
   might be kindled by a sort of jealousy, and be thus led to repentance.
   He no doubt had an eye to the testimony of Moses, which he had already
   quoted, where the Lord threatened Israel, -- that as he had been
   provoked by them to emulation through their false gods; so he also,
   according to the law of retaliation, would provoke them by a foolish
   nation.

   The word here used denotes the feeling of emulation or jealousy with
   which we are excited, when we see another preferred before us. Since
   then it was the Lord's purpose that Israel should be provoked to
   emulation, they were not so fallen as to be precipitated into eternal
   ruin; but that God's blessing, despised by them, might come to the
   Gentiles, in order that they might at length be also stirred up to seek
   the Lord, from whom they had fallen away.

   But there is no reason for readers to weary themselves much as to the
   application of this testimony: for Paul does not dwell on the strict
   meaning of the word, but alludes only to a common and well-known
   practice. For as emulation stimulates a wife, who for her fault has
   been rejected by her husband, so that she strives to be reconciled
   again; so it may be now, he says, that the Jews, seeing the Gentiles
   introduced into their place, will be touched with grief for their
   divorce, and seek reconciliation.

   12. And if their fall, etc. As he had taught us that after the Jews
   were repudiated, the Gentiles were introduced in their place, that he
   might not make the salvation of the Jews to be disliked by the
   Gentiles, as though their salvation depended on the ruin of the Jews,
   he anticipates this false notion, and lays down a sentiment of an
   opposite kind, that nothing would conduce more to advance the salvation
   of the Gentiles, than that the grace of God should flourish and abound
   among the Jews. To prove this, he derives an argument from the less, --
   "If their fall had raised the Gentiles, and their diminution had
   enriched them, how much more their fullness?" for the first was done
   contrary to nature, and the last will be done according to a natural
   order of things. And it is no objection to this reasoning, that the
   word of God had flowed to the Gentiles, after the Jews had rejected,
   and, as it were, cast it from them; for if they had received it, their
   faith would have brought forth much more fruit than their unbelief had
   occasioned; for the truth of God would have been thereby confirmed by
   being accomplished in them, and they also themselves would have led
   many by their teaching, whom they, on the contrary, by their
   perverseness, had turned aside.

   Now he would have spoken more strictly correct, if, to the fall, he had
   opposed rising: [351] of this I remind you, that no one may expect here
   an adorned language, and may not be offended with this simple mode of
   speaking; for these things were written to mold the heart and not the
   tongue.

   13. For to you Gentiles I speak, etc. He confirms by a strong reason,
   that nothing shall be lost by the Gentiles, were the Jews to return
   again to favor with God; for he shows, that the salvation of both is so
   connected, that it can by the same means be promoted. For he thus
   addresses the Gentiles, -- "Though I am peculiarly destined to be your
   Apostle, and ought therefore with special care to seek your salvation,
   with which I am charged, and to omit as it were all other things, and
   to labor for that only, I shall yet be faithfully discharging my
   office, by gaining to Christ any of my own nation; and this will be for
   the glory of my ministry, and so for your good." [352] For whatever
   served to render Paul's ministry illustrious, was advantageous to the
   Gentiles, whose salvation was its object.

   And here also he uses the verb parazelosai, to provoke to emulation,
   and for this purpose, that the Gentiles might seek the accomplishment
   of Moses' prophecy, such as he describes, when they understood that it
   would be for their benefit.

   14. And save, etc. Observe here that the minister of the word is said
   in some way to save those whom he leads to the obedience of faith. So
   conducted indeed ought to be the ministry of our salvation, as that we
   may feel that the whole power and efficacy of it depends on God, and
   that we may give him his due praise: we ought at the same time to
   understand that preaching is an instrument for effecting the salvation
   of the faithful, and though it can do nothing without the Spirit of
   God, yet through his inward operation it produces the most powerful
   effects.

   15. For if their rejections, etc. This passage, which many deem
   obscure, and some awfully pervert, ought, in my view, to be understood
   as another argument, derived from a comparison of the less with the
   greater, according to this import, "Since the rejection of the Jews has
   availed so much as to occasion the reconciling of the Gentiles, how
   much more effectual will be their resumption? Will it not be to raise
   them even from the dead?" For Paul ever insists on this, that the
   Gentiles have no cause for envy, as though the restoration of the Jews
   to favor were to render their condition worse. Since then God has
   wonderfully drawn forth life from death and light from darkness, how
   much more ought we to hope, he reasons, that the resurrection of a
   people, as it were, wholly dead, will bring life to the Gentiles. [353]
   It is no objection what some allege, that reconciliation differs not
   from resurrection, as we do indeed understand resurrection in the
   present instance, that is, to be that by which we are translated from
   the kingdom of death to the kingdom of life, for though the thing is
   the same, yet there is more force in the expression, and this a
   sufficient answer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [351] This is not quite correct: the first part is a mere announcement
   of a fact -- the fall of the Jews; and then in what follows, according
   to the usual style of Scripture, the same thing is stated in other
   words, and a corresponding clause is added; and the antithesis is found
   to be suitable -- the diminution and the completion. The reason for the
   restatement of the first clause seems to be this, -- that the fall
   might not be deemed as total, but in part; it was hettema, a less part,
   a diminution, a lessening of their number in God's kingdom. A contrast
   to this is the pleroma, the full or complete portion, that is, their
   complete restoration, as it is said in Romans 11:26. To preserve the
   antithesis, the first word must have its literal meaning, a diminution
   or lessening, that is, as to the number saved. Hammond renders the
   phrase, "their paucity." -- Ed.

   [352] The meaning attached here to the words ten diakonian mou doxazo,
   is somewhat different from what is commonly understood. Its classical
   sense, "highly to estimate," is what is generally given here to the
   verb: but Calvin takes it in a sense in which it is mostly taken in
   Scripture, as meaning, "to render illustrious," or eminent, "to render
   glorious." The construction of the two Romans 11:13 and 14, is somewhat
   difficult, and the meaning is not very clear. To include the words, "as
   I am indeed the Apostle of the Gentiles," in a parenthesis, as it is
   done by some, would render the sense more evident, and to add "this"
   after "say," and "that" before "I render." The version then would be as
   follows, -- 13. For I say this to you Gentiles (as I am indeed the
   Apostle of the Gentiles,) that I render my ministry glorious, 14. If I
   shall by any means excite to emulation my own flesh and save some of
   them. The sentiment in the last clause is the same as that at the end
   of Romans 11:11. The Vulgate, and some of the Latin Fathers, and also
   Luther, read doxaso in the future tense; which would make the passage
   read better, -- "that I shall render," etc. These two verses are not
   necessarily connected with the Apostle's argument; for in the following
   verse he resumes the subject of Romans 11:12, or rather, as his usual
   manner is, he states the same thing in other words and in more explicit
   and stronger terms. So that the gar in the next verse may very properly
   be rendered "yea," or as an illative, "then." -- Ed.

   [353] Some view the last words, "life from the dead," as understood of
   the Jews and not of the Gentiles. But the antithesis seems to require
   the latter meaning. The rejection or casting away, apobole of the Jews
   was the occasion of reconciliation to the world, that is, the Gentiles;
   then the reception, proslepsis, of the Jews will be "life from the
   dead" to the Gentiles or to the world. He expresses by stronger terms
   the sentiment in Romans 11:12, "the riches of the world," only
   intimating, as it appears, the decayed state of religion among the
   Gentiles; for to be dead sometimes means a religious declension,
   Revelation 3:1,2; or a state of oppression and wretchedness, as the
   case was with the Israelites when in captivity, Ezekiel 37:1-14; Isaiah
   26:19. The phrase is evidently figurative, and signifies a wonderful
   revival, such as the coming to life of those in a condition resembling
   that of death. The restoration of the Jews unto God's favor will
   occasion the revival and spread of true religion through the whole
   Gentile world. This is clearly the meaning. Some of the fathers, such
   as Chrysostom and Theodoret, regarded the words as referring to the
   last resurrection: but this is wholly at variance with the context. --
   Ed.

   Romans 11:16-21

   16. For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the
   root be holy, so are the branches.

   16. Quod si primitiae sanctae, etiam conspersio; et si radix sancta
   etiam rami:

   17. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild
   olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the
   root and fatness of the olive tree;

   17. Si vero ex ramis quidam defracti sunt, tu vero oleaster quum esses,
   insitus es pro ipsis, et particeps factus es radicis et pinguedinis
   oleae;

   18. Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not
   the root, but the root thee.

   18. Ne contra ramos glorieris: quod si gloriaris, non tu radicem
   portas; sed radix to.

   19. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be
   graffed in.

   19. Dices ergo, Defracti sunt rami, ut ego insererer.

   20. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest
   by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear:

   20. Bene; propter incredulitatem defracti sunt, tu vero fide stabilitus
   es; Ne animo efferaris, sed timeas.

   21. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also
   spare not thee.

   21. Si enim Deus naturalibus ramis non perpercit, vide ne qua fit, ut
   et tibi non parcat.

   16. For if the first-fruits, etc. By comparing the worthiness of the
   Jews and of the Gentiles, he now takes away pride from the one and
   pacifies the other, as far as he could; for he shows that the Gentiles,
   if they pretended any prerogative of honor of their own, did in no
   respect excel the Jews, nay, that if they came to a contest, they
   should be left far behind. Let us remember that in this comparison man
   is not compared with man, but nation with nation. If then a comparison
   be made between them, they shall be found equal in this respect, that
   they are both equally the children of Adam; the only difference is that
   the Jews had been separated from the Gentiles, that they might be a
   peculiar people to the Lord. [354]

   They were then sanctified by the holy covenant, and adorned with
   peculiar honor, with which God had not at that time favored the
   Gentiles; but as the efficacy of the covenant appeared then but small,
   he bids us to look back to Abraham and the patriarchs, in whom the
   blessing of God was not indeed either empty or void. He hence
   concludes, that from them an heredity holiness had passed to all their
   posterity. But this conclusion would not have been right had he spoken
   of persons, or rather had he not regarded the promise; for when the
   father is just, he cannot yet transmit his own uprightness to his son:
   but as the Lord had sanctified Abraham for himself for this end, that
   his seed might also be holy, and as he thus conferred holiness not only
   on his person but also on his whole race, the Apostle does not
   unsuitably draw this conclusion, that all the Jews were sanctified in
   their father Abraham. [355]

   Then to confirm this view, he adduces two similitudes: the one taken
   from the ceremonies of the law, and the other borrowed from nature. The
   first-fruits which were offered sanctified the whole lump, in like
   manner the goodness of the juice diffuses itself from the root to the
   branches; and posterity hold the same connection with their parents
   from whom they proceed as the lump has with the first-fruits, and the
   branches with the tree. It is not then a strange thing that the Jews
   were sanctified in their father. There is here no difficulty if you
   understand by holiness the spiritual nobility of the nation, and that
   indeed not belonging to nature, but what proceeded from the covenant.
   It may be truly said, I allow, that the Jews were naturally holy, for
   their adoption was hereditary; but I now speak of our first nature,
   according to which we are all, as we know, accursed in Adam. Therefore
   the dignity of an elect people, to speak correctly, is a supernatural
   privilege.

   17. And if some of the branches, etc. He now refers to the present
   dignity of the Gentiles, which is no other than to be of the branches;
   which, being taken from another, are set in some noble tree: for the
   origin of the Gentiles was as it were from some wild and unfruitful
   olive, as nothing but a curse was to be found in their whole race.
   Whatever glory then they had was from their new insition, not from
   their old stock. There was then no reason for the Gentiles to glory in
   their own dignity in comparison with the Jews. We may also add, that
   Paul wisely mitigates the severity of the case, by not saying that the
   whole top of the tree was cut off, but that some of the branches were
   broken, and also that God took some here and there from among the
   Gentiles, whom he set in the holy and blessed trunk. [356]

   18. But if thou gloriest, thou bearest not the root, etc. The Gentiles
   could not contend with the Jews respecting the excellency of their race
   without contending with Abraham himself; which would have been
   extremely unbecoming, since he was like a root by which they were borne
   and nourished. As unreasonable as it would be for the branches to boast
   against the root, so unreasonable would it have been for the Gentiles
   to glory against the Jews, that is, with respect to the excellency of
   their race; for Paul would have them ever to consider whence was the
   origin of their salvation. And we know that after Christ by his coming
   has pulled down the partition-wall, the whole world partook of the
   favor which God had previously conferred on the chosen people. It hence
   follows, that the calling of the Gentiles was like an ingrafting, and
   that they did not otherwise grow up as God's people than as they were
   grafted in the stock of Abraham.

   19. Thou wilt then say, etc. In the person of the Gentiles he brings
   forward what they might have pleaded for themselves; but that was of
   such a nature as ought not to have filled them with pride, but, on the
   contrary, to have made them humble. For if the cutting off of the Jews
   was through unbelief, and if the ingrafting of the Gentiles was by
   faith, what was their duty but to acknowledge the favor of God, and
   also to cherish modesty and humbleness of mind? For it is the nature of
   faith, and what properly belongs to it, to generate humility and fear.
   [357] But by fear understand that which is in no way inconsistent with
   the assurance of faith; for Paul would not have our faith to vacillate
   or to alternate with doubt, much less would he have us to be frightened
   or to quake with fear. [358]

   Of what kind then is this fear? As the Lord bids us to take into our
   consideration two things, so two kinds of feeling must thereby be
   produced. For he would have us ever to bear in mind the miserable
   condition of our nature; and this can produce nothing but dread,
   weariness, anxiety, and despair; and it is indeed expedient that we
   should thus be thoroughly laid prostrate and broken down, that we may
   at length groan to him; but this dread, derived from the knowledge of
   ourselves, keeps not our minds while relying on his goodness, from
   continuing calm; this weariness hinders us not from enjoying full
   consolation in him; this anxiety, this despair, does not prevent us
   from obtaining in him real joy and hope. Hence the fear, of which he
   speaks, is set up as an antidote to proud contempt; for as every one
   claims for himself more than what is right, and becomes too secure and
   at length insolent towards others, we ought then so far to fear, that
   our heart may not swell with pride and elate itself.

   But it seems that he throws in a doubt as to salvation, since he
   reminds them to beware lest they also should not be spared. To this I
   answer, -- that as this exhortation refers to the subduing of the
   flesh, which is ever insolent even in the children of God, he derogates
   nothing from the certainty of faith. And we must especially notice and
   remember what I have before said, -- that Paul's address is not so much
   to individuals as to the whole body of the Gentiles, among whom there
   might have been many, who were vainly inflated, professing rather than
   having faith. On account of these Paul threatens the Gentiles, not
   without reason, with excision, as we shall hereafter find again.

   21. For if God has not spared the natural branches, etc. This is a most
   powerful reason to beat down all self-confidence: for the rejection of
   the Jews should never come across our minds without striking and
   shaking us with dread. For what ruined them, but that through supine
   dependence on the dignity which they had obtained, they despised what
   God had appointed? They were not spared, though they were natural
   branches; what then shall be done to us, who are the wild olive and
   aliens, if we become beyond measure arrogant? But this thought, as it
   leads us to distrust ourselves, so it tends to make us to cleave more
   firmly and steadfastly to the goodness of God.

   And here again it appears more evident, that the discourse is addressed
   generally to the body of the Gentiles, for the excision, of which he
   speaks, could not apply to individuals, whose election is unchangeable,
   based on the eternal purpose of God. Paul therefore declares to the
   Gentiles, that if they exulted over the Jews, a reward for their pride
   would be prepared for them; for God will again reconcile to himself the
   first people whom he has divorced.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [354] There were two kinds of first-fruits: the sheaf, being the first
   ripe fruit, Leviticus 23:10; and the dough, the first kneaded cake,
   Numbers 15:20. It is to the last that the reference is here made. The
   first-fruits are considered by some, such as Mede and Chalmers, to have
   been the first Jewish converts to Christianity -- the apostles and
   disciples; but this is not consistent with the usual manner of the
   Apostle, which is to express the same thing in two ways, or by two
   metaphors. Besides, the whole context refers to the first adoption of
   the Jewish nation, or to the covenant made with Abraham and confirmed
   to the patriarchs. -- Ed.

   [355] That the holiness here mentioned is external and relative, and
   not personal and inward, is evident from the whole context. The
   children of Israel were denominated holy in all their wickedness and
   disobedience, because they had been consecrated to God, adopted as his
   people, and set apart for his service, and they enjoyed all the
   external privileges of the covenant which God had made with their
   fathers. Pareus makes a distinction between what passes from
   progenitors to their offspring and what does not pass. In the present
   case the rights and privileges of the covenant were transmitted, but
   not faith and inward holiness. "Often," he says, "the worst descend
   from the best, and the best from the worst; from wicked Ahaz sprang
   good Hezekiah, from Hezekiah descended impious Manasse, from Manasse
   again came good Josiah, and from Josiah sprang wicked sons, Shallum and
   Jehoiakim." But all were alike holy in the sense intended here by the
   Apostle, as they were circumcised, and inherited the transmissible
   rights and privileges of the covenant. "The holiness," says Turrettin,
   "of the first-fruits and of the root was no other than an external,
   federal, and national consecration, such as could be transferred from
   parents to their children." "The attentive reader," says Scott, "will
   readily perceive that relative holiness, or consecration to God, is
   here exclusively meant. [...] Abraham was as it were the root of the
   visible Church. Ishmael was broken off, and the tree grew up in Isaac;
   and when Esau was broken off, it grew up in Jacob and his sons. [...]
   When the nation rejected the Messiah, their relation to Abraham and to
   God was as it were suspended. They no longer retained even the outward
   seal of the covenant; for circumcision lost its validity and baptism
   became the sign of regeneration: they were thenceforth deprived of the
   ordinances of God." -- Ed.

   [356] There is a difference of opinion as to the precise meaning of the
   words enekentristhes en autois Calvin's version is, "insitus es pro
   ipsis -- thou hast been ingrafted for them," or in their stead; that of
   Beza and Pareus is the same, and also that of Macknight; but Grotius
   has "inter illos -- between them," that is, the remaining branches; and
   Doddridge renders the words "among them," according to our version.
   What is most consonant with the first part of the verse, is the
   rendering of Calvin; what is stated is the cutting off of some of the
   branches, and the most obvious meaning is, that others were put in for
   them, or in their stead. It has been said, that it was not the practice
   to graft a wild olive in a good olive, except when the latter was
   decaying, such may have been the case; but the Apostle's object was not
   so much to refer to what was usual, as to form a comparison suitable to
   his purpose; and this is what our Savior in his parables had sometimes
   done. Contrary to what the case is in nature, the Apostle makes the
   stock good and the graft bad, and makes the stock to communicate its
   goodness to the graft and to improve the quality of its fruit. But his
   main object is to show the fact of incision, without any regard to the
   character of the stock and of the graft in natural things; for both his
   stock and his graft are of a different character. -- Ed.

   [357] "Be not elated in mind -- ne animo efferaris;" me hupselophronei;
   "be not high-minded," as in our version, is the literal rendering. --
   Ed.

   [358] Some have deduced from what Paul says here the uncertainty of
   faith, and its possible failure. This has been done through an entire
   misapprehension of the subject handled by the Apostle. He speaks not of
   individuals, but of the Gentile world, not of living faith but of
   professed faith, not the inward change, but of outward privileges, not
   of the union of the soul to Christ, but of union with his Church. The
   two things are wholly different; and to draw an argument from the one
   to the other is altogether illegitimate; that is to say, that as
   professed faith may be lost, therefore living faith may be lost.
   Augustine, in commenting on Jeremiah 32:40, says, "God promised
   perseverance when he said, I will put fear in their heart, that they
   may not depart from me.' What else does it mean but this, such and so
   great will my fear be, which I shall put in their heart, that they
   shall perseveringly cleave to me.'" "As those," says Pareus, "who
   believe for a time never had true faith, though they seem to have had
   it, and hence fall away and do not persevere: so they who possess true
   faith never fail, but continue steadfast, for God infallibly sustains
   them and secures their perseverance." -- Ed.

   Romans 11:22-24

   22. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which
   fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his
   goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

   22. Vide igitur lenitatem [359] et severitatem Dei; in eos quidem qui
   ceciderunt, severitatem; [360] in te vero lenitatem, si permanseris in
   lenitate; alioqui tu quoque excideris:

   23. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
   graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.

   23. Et illi, si non perstiterint in incredulitate, inserentur; potens
   enim est Deus rursum inserere ipsos.

   24. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature,
   and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much
   more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their
   own olive tree?

   24. Si enim tu ex oleastro, quae tibi nativa erat, exectus es, et
   printer naturam insitus es in veram oleam; multo magis hi secundum
   naturam propriae oleae inserentur.

   22. See then, etc. By laying the case before their eyes he more clearly
   and fully confirms the fact, -- that the Gentiles had no reason to be
   proud. They saw in the Jews an example of God's severity, which ought
   to have terrified them; while in themselves they had an evidence of his
   grace and goodness, by which they ought to have been stimulated to
   thankfulness only, and to exalt the Lord and not themselves. The words
   import the same, as though he had said, -- "If thou exultest over their
   calamity, think first what thou hast been; for the same severity of God
   would have impended over thee, hadst thou not been delivered by his
   gratuitous favor: then consider what thou art even now; for salvation
   shall not continue to thee, except thou humbly recognisest the mercy of
   God; for if thou forgettest thyself and arrogantly exultest, the ruin,
   into which they have fallen, awaits thee: it is not indeed enough for
   thee to have once embraced the favor of God, except thou followest his
   call through the whole course of thy life." They indeed who have been
   illuminated by the Lord ought always to think of perseverance; for they
   continue not in the goodness of God, who having for a time responded to
   the call of God, do at length begin to loathe the kingdom of heaven,
   and thus by their ingratitude justly deserve to be blinded again.

   But he addresses not each of the godly apart, as we have already said,
   but he makes a comparison between the Gentiles and the Jews. It is
   indeed true that each individual among the Jews received the reward due
   to his own unbelief, when they were banished from the kingdom of God,
   and that all who front among the Gentiles were called, were vessels of
   God's mercy; but yet the particular design of Paul must be borne in
   mind. For he would have the Gentiles to depend on the eternal covenant
   of God, so as to connect their own with the salvation of the elect
   people, and then, lest the rejection of the Jews should produce
   offense, as though their ancient adoption were void, he would have them
   to be terrified by this example of punishment, so as reverently to
   regard the judgment of God. For whence comes so great licentiousness on
   curious questions, except that we almost neglect to consider those
   things which ought to have duly taught us humility?

   But as he speaks not of the elect individually, but of the whole body,
   a condition is added, If they continued in his kindness I indeed allow,
   that as soon as any one abuses God's goodness, he deserves to be
   deprived of the offered favor; but it would be improper to say of any
   one of the godly particularly, that God had mercy on him, when he chose
   him, provided he would continue in his mercy; for the perseverance of
   faith, which completes in us the effect of God's grace, flows from
   election itself. Paul then teaches us, that the Gentiles were admitted
   into the hope of eternal life on the condition, that they by their
   gratitude retained possession of it. And dreadful indeed was the
   defection of the whole world, which afterwards happened; and this
   dearly proves, that this exhortation was not superfluous; for when God
   had almost in a moment watered it with his grace, so that religion
   flourished everywhere, soon after the truth of the gospel vanished, and
   the treasure of salvation was taken away. And whence came so sudden a
   change, except that the Gentiles had fallen away from their calling?

   Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off, etc. We now understand in what
   sense Paul threatens them with excision, whom he has already allowed to
   have been grafted into the hope of life through God's election. For,
   first, though this cannot happen to the elect, they have yet need of
   such warning, in order to subdue the pride of the flesh; which being
   really opposed to their salvation, ought justly to be terrified with
   the dread of perdition. As far then as Christians are illuminated by
   faith, they hear, for their assurance, that the calling of God is
   without repentance; but as far as they carry about them the flesh,
   which wantonly resists the grace of God, they are taught humility by
   this warning, "Take heed lest thou be cut off." Secondly, we must bear
   in mind the solution which I have before mentioned, -- that Paul speaks
   not here of the special election of individuals, but sets the Gentiles
   and Jews in opposition the one to the other; and that therefore the
   elect are not so much addressed in these words, as those who falsely
   gloried that they had obtained the place of the Jews: nay, he speaks to
   the Gentiles generally, and addresses the whole body in common, among
   whom there were many who were faithful, and those who were members of
   Christ in name only.

   But if it be asked respecting individuals, "How any one could be cut
   off from the grafting, and how, after excision, he could be grafted
   again," -- bear in mind, that there are three modes of insition, and
   two modes of excision. For instance, the children of the faithful are
   ingrafted, to whom the promise belongs according to the covenant made
   with the fathers; ingrafted are also they who indeed receive the seed
   of the gospel, but it strikes no root, or it is choked before it brings
   any fruit; and thirdly, the elect are ingrafted, who are illuminated
   unto eternal life according to the immutable purpose of God. The first
   are cut off, when they refuse the promise given to their fathers, or do
   not receive it on account of their ingratitude; the second are cut off,
   when the seed is withered and destroyed; and as the danger of this
   impends over all, with regard to their own nature, it must be allowed
   that this warning which Paul gives belongs in a certain way to the
   faithful, lest they indulge themselves in the sloth of the flesh. But
   with regard to the present passage, it is enough for us to know, that
   the vengeance which God had executed on the Jews, is pronounced on the
   Gentiles, in case they become like them.

   23. For God is able, etc. Frigid would this argument be to the profane;
   for however they may concede power to God, yet as they view it at a
   distance, shut up as it were in heaven, they do for the most part rob
   it of its effect. But as the faithful, whenever they hear God's power
   named, look on it as in present operation, he thought that this reason
   was sufficient to strike their minds. We may add, that he assumes this
   as an acknowledged axiom, -- that God had so punished the unbelief of
   his people as not to forget his mercy; according to what he had done
   before, having often restored the Jews, after he had apparently
   banished them from his kingdom. And he shows at the same time by the
   comparison, how much more easy it would be to reverse the present state
   of things than to have introduced it; that is, how much easier it would
   be for the natural branches, if they were again put in the place from
   which they had been cut off, to draw substance from their own root,
   than for the wild and the unfruitful, from a foreign stock: for such is
   the comparison made between the Jews and the Gentiles.

   [359] "Lenitatem;" chrestoteta; "indulgentiam -- indulgence," Jerome;
   "benignitatem -- benignity," Beza. Its most literal meaning is
   "beneficence," as chestos is useful or beneficial: but "goodness," as
   in our version, expresses its sense here perhaps better than any other
   word. It is rendered "kindness" in 2 Corinthians 6:6; Ephesians 2:7;
   Colossians 3:12; Titus 3:4; -- "gentleness" in Galatians 5:22, -- and
   "good" in Romans 3:12. It is nowhere else found and has a similar
   meaning in the Septuagint, and stands often for tvv, which signifies
   good, goodness, benevolence. -- Ed.

   [360] "Severitatem;" apotomian; "rigorem -- rigor," Erasmus, "praecisam
   severitatem -- a cut-off severity," Beza. It means literally excision,
   cutting off, amputation, and metaphorically, rigor, severity; and it is
   taken, says Schleusner, not from the amputation of infected limbs, but
   from the cutting off of barren and useless branches of trees. It occurs
   here only, and is not found in the Septuagint Apotmia ton nomon --
   rigor of the laws, Diod. Sic. It is used adverbially in two places, 2
   Corinthians 13:10, and Titus 1:13; where it means rigidly, sharply,
   severely. The adjective, apotomos, is found in Wisdom of Solomon 5:20,
   and Solomon 6:6, connected with "wrath" and "judgment," and means rigid
   or severe. -- Ed.

   Romans 11:25-27

   25. For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
   mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in
   part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come
   in.

   25. Nolo enim vos ignorare, fratres, mysterium hoc, ut ne apud
   vosmetipsos superbiatis, quod caecitas ex parte Israeli contigit, donec
   plenitudo gentium ingrediatur:

   26. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall
   come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
   Jacob:

   26. Atque ita universus Israel salvus fiet; quemadmodum scriptum est,
   Veniet ex Sion is qui liberat, et avertet impietates a Iacob:

   27. For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their
   sins.

   27. Et hoc illis a me testamentum, quum abstulero peccata eorum.

   25. I would not, etc. Here he rouses his hearers to a greater
   attention, while he avows that he is going to declare something that
   was secret. Nor did he do this without reason; for he wished to
   conclude, by a brief or plain sentence, a very perplexed question; and
   yet he declares what no one could have expected. But the words, Lest ye
   should be proud in yourselves, [361] show what was his designed object;
   and that was, to check the arrogance of the Gentiles, lest they should
   exult over the Jews. This admonition was also necessary, lest the
   defection of that people should immoderately disturb the minds of the
   weak, as though the salvation of them all was to be forever despaired
   of. The same is still not less useful to us at this day, so that we may
   know, that the salvation of the remnant, whom the Lord will at length
   gather to himself, is hid, sealed as it were by his signet. And
   whenever a long delay tempts us to despair, let us remember this word
   mystery; by which Paul clearly reminds us, that the mode of their
   conversion will neither be common nor usual; and hence they act
   absurdly who attempt to measure it by their own judgment; for what can
   be more unreasonable than to regard that as incredible which is far
   removed from our view? It is called a mystery, because it will be
   incomprehensible until the time of its revelation. [362] It is,
   however, made known to us, as it was to the Romans, that our faith may
   be content with the word, and support us with hope, until the event
   itself come to light.

   That blindness in part, etc. "In part," I think, refers not simply to
   time, nor to the number, but means, in a manner, or in a measure; by
   which expression he intended, as it seems to me, only to qualify a
   declaration which in itself was severe. Until does not specify the
   progress or order of time, but signifies the same thing, as though he
   had said, "That the fullness of the Gentiles," etc. The meaning then
   is, -- That God had in a manner so blinded Israel, that while they
   refused the light of the gospel, it might be transferred to the
   Gentiles, and that these might occupy, as it were, the vacated
   possession. And so this blindness served the providence of God in
   furthering the salvation of the Gentiles, which he had designed. And
   the fullness of the Gentiles is to be taken for a great number: for it
   was not to be, as before, when a few proselytes connected themselves
   with the Jews; but such was to be the change, that the Gentiles would
   form almost the entire body of the Church. [363]

   26. And so all Israel, etc. Many understand this of the Jewish people,
   as though Paul had said, that religion would again be restored among
   them as before: but I extend the word Israel to all the people of God,
   according to this meaning, -- "When the Gentiles shall come in, the
   Jews also shall return from their defection to the obedience of faith;
   and thus shall be completed the salvation of the whole Israel of God,
   which must be gathered from both; and yet in such a way that the Jews
   shall obtain the first place, being as it were the first-born in God's
   family." This interpretation seems to me the most suitable, because
   Paul intended here to set forth the completion of the kingdom of
   Christ, which is by no means to be confined to the Jews, but is to
   include the whole world. The same manner of speaking we find in
   Galatians 6:16. The Israel of God is what he calls the Church, gathered
   alike from Jews and Gentiles; and he sets the people, thus collected
   from their dispersion, in opposition to the carnal children of Abraham,
   who had departed from his faith.

   As it is written, etc. He does not confirm the whole passage by this
   testimony of Isaiah, (Isaiah 59:20,) but only one clause, -- that the
   children of Abraham shall be partakers of redemption. But if one takes
   this view, -- that Christ had been promised and offered to them, but
   that as they rejected him, they were deprived of his grace; yet the
   Prophet's words express more, even this, -- that there will be some
   remnant, who, having repented, shall enjoy the favor of deliverance.

   Paul, however, does not quote what we read in Isaiah, word for word;

   "come," he says, "shall a Redeemer to Sion, and to those who shall
   repent of iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord." (Isaiah 59:20.)

   But on this point we need not be very curious; only this is to be
   regarded, that the Apostles suitably apply to their purpose whatever
   proofs they adduce from the Old Testament; for their object was to
   point but passages, as it were by the finger, that readers might be
   directed to the fountain itself.

   But though in this prophecy deliverance to the spiritual people of God
   is promised, among whom even Gentiles are included; yet as the Jews are
   the first-born, what the Prophet declares must be fulfilled, especially
   in them: for that Scripture calls all the people of God Israelites, is
   to be ascribed to the pre-eminence of that nation, whom God had
   preferred to all other nations. And then, from a regard to the ancient
   covenant, he says expressly, that a Redeemer shall come to Sion; and he
   adds, that he will redeem those in Jacob who shall return from their
   transgression. [364] By these words God distinctly claims for himself a
   certain seed, so that his redemption may be effectual in his elect and
   peculiar nation. And though fitter for his purpose would have been the
   expression used by the Prophet, "shall come to Sion;" yet Paul made no
   scruple to follow the commonly received translation, which reads, "The
   Redeemer shall come forth from Mount Sion." And similar is the case as
   to the second part, "He shall turn away iniquities from Jacob:" for
   Paul thought it enough to regard this point only, -- that as it is
   Christ's peculiar office to reconcile to God an apostate and faithless
   people, some change was surely to be looked for, lest they should all
   perish together.

   27. And, this is my covenant with them, etc. Though Paul, by the last
   prophecy of Isaiah, briefly touched on the office of the Messiah, in
   order to remind the Jews what was to be expected especially from him,
   he further adds these few words from Jeremiah, expressly for the same
   purpose; for what is added is not found in the former passage. [365]
   This also tends to confirm the subject in hand; for what he said of the
   conversion of a people who were so stubborn and obstinate, might have
   appeared incredible: he therefore removes this stumblingblock, by
   declaring that the covenant included a gratuitous remission of sins.
   For we may gather from the words of the Prophet, -- that God would have
   no more to do with his apostate people, until he should remit the crime
   of perfidy, as well as their other sins.

   [361] "Ne apud vos superbiatis;" hina me ote par heautois phronimoi;
   "ut ne sitis apud vosmetipsos sapientes -- lest ye should be wise in
   yourselves," -- Beza and Piscator. The meaning, as given by Grotius,
   is, "Lest ye think yourselves so wise as to suppose that ye can by your
   own understanding know what it is to come." But the object of the
   Apostle seems to have been, to keep down self-elevation on account of
   the privileges they had attained. The phrase seems to have been taken
   from Proverbs 3:7; where the Septuagint render, "in thine own eyes,"
   vynyk, para seauto, "in thyself," that is, in thine own esteem. And it
   appears to be its meaning here, "Lest ye should be wise in your own
   esteem," which signifies, "Lest ye should be proud," or elated, that
   is, on account of your now superior privileges and advantages.
   Doddridge's version expresses the idea, "Lest you should have too high
   an opinion of yourselves." -- Ed.

   [362] The mystery is accounted for in rather a singular way. The most
   obvious meaning is, that the mystery was the fact of the restoration,
   and not the manner of it. No doubt the word sometimes means what is
   obscure, sublime, or profound, as "great is the mystery of godliness,"
   1 Timothy 3:16: but here the mystery is made known, in the same manner
   as Paul mentions a fact respecting the resurrection, 1 Corinthians
   15:51, and also the call of the Gentiles, Romans 16:25. -- Ed.

   [363] The explanation of this verse is by no means satisfactory. It
   does not Correspond at all with what the Apostle has already declared
   in Romans 11:11,12, and 15; where the restoration of the Jews to the
   faith is most clearly set forth. Besides, by making Israel, in the next
   verse, to mean generally the people of God, the contrast, observable
   through the whole argument, is completely destroyed. The word for
   "blindness" is porosis, hardness, callousness, and hence contumacy. "In
   part," is generally regarded as having reference both to extent and
   duration: the hardness did not extend to all the Jews, and it was not
   to endure, but to continue for a time; and the time is mentioned,
   "until the fullness of the Gentiles come in." This is obviously the
   meaning, and confirmed by the whole context. The attempt of Grotius and
   Hammond, and of some of the Fathers, to confine what is said to the
   Apostolic times, is wholly irreconcilable with the drift of the whole
   passage and with facts. Much as been written on the words, achris ou to
   pleroma ton ethnon eiselthHu. That the event was future in the
   Apostle's time, (and future still as history proves) is evident,
   especially from the following verse, "and so all Israel shall be
   saved." The plain construction of the passage is, "until the fullness
   of the Gentiles shall come." What this "fullness" is to be has been
   much controverted. But by taking a view of the whole context, without
   regard to any hypothesis, we shall, with no great difficulty, ascertain
   its meaning. The "fullness" of the Jews in Romans 11:12, is determined
   by Romans 11:26; it includes the whole nation. Then the "fullness of
   the Gentiles" must mean the same thing, the introduction of all nations
   into the Church. The grafting more particularly signifies profession.
   It then follows that all nations shall be brought publicly to profess
   the gospel prior to the removal of the hardness from the whole nation
   of the Jews. There may be isolated cases of conversion before this
   event, for "in part" as to extent the hardness is to be: but all shall
   not be brought to the faith, until the faith spread through the whole
   world: and the effect of their restoration will be a great revival of
   vital religion among the professing Gentiles, according to what is said
   in Romans 11:15. This is clearly the view presented to us in this
   extraordinary passage, when all its parts are compared with each other.
   Hammond tells us, that many of the Fathers wholly denied the future
   restoration of the Jews, and we are told by Pareus, who mentions some
   of the same Fathers, that they maintained it. But it appears from the
   quotations made by the first, that the restoration disallowed was that
   to their own land, and that the restoration referred to by the latter
   was restoration to the faith; two things wholly distinct. That "Israel"
   means exclusively the Jewish nation, was almost the unanimous opinion
   of the Fathers, according to Estius; and that their future restoration
   to the faith is here foretold was the sentiment held by Beza, Pareus,
   Willet, Mede, and others, and is generally held by modern divines. --
   Ed.

   [364] There is more discrepancy in this reference than any we have met
   with. The Apostle follows not literally either the Hebrew or the
   Septuagint, though the latter more than the former. In the Hebrew, it
   is, "to Sion," ltsyvn, and in the Septuagint, "for the sake of Sion,"
   heneken Sion. Then the following clause is given verbatim from the
   Septuagint, and differs materially from the Hebrew, at least as
   translated in our version. The Syriac and Chaldee give the verb a
   causative meaning, so as to make the sense the same as here. But it may
   be regarded as an infinitive with a pargogic y, and in a transitive
   sense, which it sometimes has. See 1 Kings 2:16; Psalm 132:10. If so,
   the verse will agree with the Apostle's words, and may be thus
   rendered, -- Come to Sion shall a deliverer,
   And to turn away the ungodliness that is in Jacob. He shall come to
   Sion, and shall come "to turn away," etc.; or the v may be rendered
   even, "Even to turn away," etc. This rendering corresponds more than
   that of our version with the substance of the verse which follows. --
   Ed.

   [365] The former part of it is, "This is my covenant," but not the
   latter, "when I shall take away their sins." Some suppose that this is
   taken from Isaiah 27:9, where we find this phrase in the Septuagint,
   "When I shall take away his sins," ten hamartian autou: but the Hebrew
   is somewhat different and farther from the form of the sentence here.
   We must therefore consider it as an abridgment of what is contained in
   Jeremiah 31:33, and quoted in Hebrews 8:10. -- Ed.

   Romans 11:28-32

   28. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as
   touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.

   28. Secundum Evangelium quidem inimici propter vos; secundum electionem
   vero dilecti propter Patres:

   29. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

   29. Sine poenitentia enim sunt dona et vocatio Dei.

   30. For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
   obtained mercy through their unbelief:

   30. Quemadmodum enim vos quoque [366] increduli fuistis Deo, nunc autem
   misericordiam estis consequuti istorum incredulitate:

   31. Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy
   they also may obtain mercy.

   31. Sic et ii nunc increduli facti sunt, eo quod adepti estis
   misericordiam, ut ipsi quoque misericordiam consequantur. [367]

   32. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
   mercy upon all.

   32. Concludit enim Deus omnes sub incredulitate, ut omnium misereatur.

   28. With regard indeed to the gospel, etc. He shows that the worst
   thing in the Jews ought not to subject them to the contempt of the
   Gentiles. Their chief crime was unbelief: but Paul teaches us, that
   they were thus blinded for a time by God's providence, that a way to
   the gospel might be made for the Gentiles; [368] and that still they
   were not for ever excluded from the favor of God. He then admits, that
   they were for the present alienated from God on account of the gospel,
   that thus the salvation, which at first was deposited with them, might
   come to the Gentiles; and yet that God was not unmindful of the
   covenant which he had made with their fathers, and by which he
   testified that according to his eternal purpose he loved that nation:
   and this he confirms by this remarkable declaration, -- that the grace
   of the divine calling cannot be made void; for this is the import of
   the words, --

   29. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance. He has
   mentioned gifts and calling; which are to be understood, according to a
   figure in grammar, [369] as meaning the gift of calling: and this is
   not to be taken for any sort of calling but of that, by which God had
   adopted the posterity of Abraham into covenant; since this is
   especially the subject here, as he has previously, by the word,
   election, designated the secret purpose of God, by which he had
   formerly made a distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles. [370]
   For we must bear this in mind, -- that he speaks not now of the
   election of individuals, but of the common adoption of the whole
   nation, which might seem for a time, according to the outward
   appearance, to have failed, but had not been cut up by the roots. As
   the Jews had fallen from their privilege and the salvation promised
   them, that some hope might remain to the remnant, Paul maintains that
   the purpose of God stands firm and immovable, by which he had once
   deigned to choose them for himself as a peculiar nation. Since then it
   cannot possibly be, that the Lord will depart from that covenant which
   he made with Abraham,

   "I will be the God of thy seed," (Genesis 17:7,)

   it is evident that he has not wholly turned away his kindness from the
   Jewish nation.

   He does not oppose the gospel to election, as though they were contrary
   the one to the other, for whom God has chosen he calls; but inasmuch as
   the gospel had been proclaimed to the Gentiles beyond the expectation
   of the world, he justly compares this favor with the ancient election
   of the Jews, which had been manifested so many ages before: and so
   election derives its name from antiquity; for God had in past ages of
   the world chosen one people for himself.

   On account of the Fathers, he says not, because they gave any cause for
   love, but because God's favor had descended from them to their
   posterity, according to the tenor of the covenant, "Thy God and the God
   of thy seed." How the Gentiles had obtained mercy through the unbelief
   of the Jews, has been before stated, namely, that God, being angry with
   the Jews for their unbelief, turned his kindness to them. What
   immediately follows, that they became unbelievers through the mercy
   manifested to the Gentiles, seems rather strange; and yet there is in
   it nothing unreasonable; for Paul assigns not the cause of blindness,
   but only declares, that what God transferred to the Gentiles had been
   taken away from the Jews. But lest what they had lost through unbelief,
   should be thought by the Gentiles to have been gained by them through
   the merit of faith, mention is made only of mercy. What is
   substantially said then is, -- that as God purposed to show mercy to
   the Gentiles, the Jews were on this account deprived of the light of
   faith.

   32. For God has shut up, etc. A remarkable conclusion, by which he
   shows that there is no reason why they who have a hope of salvation
   should despair of others; for whatever they may now be, they have been
   like all the rest. If they have emerged from unbelief through God's
   mercy alone, they ought to leave place for it as to others also. For he
   makes the Jews equal in guilt with the Gentiles, that both might
   understand that the avenue to salvation is no less open to others than
   to them. For it is the mercy of God alone which saves; and this offers
   itself to both. This sentence then corresponds with the testimony of
   Hosea, which he had before quoted, "I will call those my people who
   were not my people." But he does not mean, that God so blinds all men
   that their unbelief is to be imputed to him; but that he hath so
   arranged by his providence, that all should be guilty of unbelief, in
   order that he might have them subject to his judgment, and for this
   end, -- that all merits being buried, salvation might proceed from his
   goodness alone. [371]

   Paul then intends here to teach two things -- that there is nothing in
   any man why he should be preferred to others, apart from the mere favor
   of God; and that God in the dispensation of his grace, is under no
   restraint that he should not grant it to whom he pleases. There is an
   emphasis in the word mercy; for it intimates that God is bound to none,
   and that he therefore saves all freely, for they are all equally lost.
   But extremely gross is their folly who hence conclude that all shall be
   saved; for Paul simply means that both Jews and Gentiles do not
   otherwise obtain salvation than through the mercy of God, and thus he
   leaves to none any reason for complaint. It is indeed true that this
   mercy is without any difference offered to all, but every one must seek
   it by faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [366] Pote -- formerly, left out.

   [367] Our common version departs here from the original by connecting
   "your mercy" with the last clause. Calvin keeps the proper order of the
   words, though he paraphrases them, to humetero eleei, "eo quod adepti
   estis misericordiam." They might have been rendered, "through your
   mercy," that is, the mercy shown to you, or the mercy of which you are
   the objects. -- Ed.

   [368] They were "enemies" to Paul and the Church, say Grotius and
   Luther, -- to the gospel, says Pareus, -- to God, says Mede and Stuart.
   The parallel in the next clause, "beloved," favors the last sentiment.
   They were become God's enemies, and alienated through their rejection
   of the gospel; but they were still regarded as descendants of the
   Fathers and in some sense on their account "beloved," as those for whom
   God entertained love, inasmuch as his "gifts and calling" made in their
   behalf, were still in force and never to be changed. -- Ed.

   [369] Hypallage -- transposition, a change in the arrangement of a
   sentence.

   [370] It is not desirable to amalgamate words in this manner; nor is it
   necessary. The Apostle ascends; he mentions first the "gifts," the free
   promises which God made to the Jews; and then he refers to the origin
   of them, the calling or the election of God, and says that both are
   irreversible, or, as Castellio well explains the word ametameleta,
   irrevocable. See a similar instance in Romans 13:13 Calvin seems to
   regard "the gifts and calling" as having reference to the adoption of
   the Jewish nation, and their adoption to certain privileges included in
   the Abrahamic covenant, probably those mentioned in Romans 9:4. But
   Pareus, Mede, and others, extend the meaning farther, and consider "the
   gifts" as including those of "faith, remission of sins, sanctification,
   perseverance and salvation;" and they understand by "calling," not the
   external, which often fails, but the internal, made by the Spirit, and
   every efficacious, of which the Apostle had spoken, when he said,
   "Those whom he has predestinated, he has called, justified, and
   glorified." According to this view the Apostle must be considered to
   mean, that according to what is said in Romans 11:5, the gifts and
   callings of God shall be effectual towards some of the Jews throughout
   all ages, and towards the whole nation, when the fullness of the
   Gentiles shall come in; or, that though they may be suspended, they
   shall yet be made evident at the appointed time; so that what secures
   and renders certain the restoration of the Jews is the covenant of free
   grace which God made with their fathers. Some, as Pareus informs us,
   have concluded from what is here said, that no Gentile nation, once
   favored with "the gifts and calling of God," shall be wholly forsaken;
   and that though religion may for a long season be in a degenerated
   state, God will yet, in his own appointed time, renew his gifts and his
   calling, and restore true religion. The ground of hope is the
   irrevocability of his gifts and calling. -- Ed.

   [371] The verb which Calvin renders conclusi, sunekleise means to shut
   up together. The paraphrase of Chrysostom is, that "God has proved
   (elenxen) all to be unbelieving." Wolfius considers the meaning the
   same with Romans 3:9, and with Galatians 3:22. God has in his
   providence, as well as in his word, proved and demonstrated, that all
   mankind are by nature in a state of unbelief and of sin and of
   condemnation. God has shut up together, etc., "how?" asks Pareus; then
   he answers, "by manifesting, accusing, and condemning unbelief, but not
   by effecting or approving it." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 11:33-36

   33. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
   how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

   33. O profunditatem divitiarum et sapientiae et cognitionis Dei! quam
   incomprehensibilia [372] sunt judicia ejus et impervestigabiles [373]
   viae ipsius!

   34. For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his
   counsellor?

   34. Quis enim cognovit mentem Domini? aut quis illi a consiliis fuit?

   35. Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto
   him again?

   35. Aut quis prior dedit ei et retribuetur illi?

   36. For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be
   glory for ever. Amen.

   36. Quoniam ex illo et per illum et in illum sunt omnia: Ipsi gloria in
   secula. Amen.

   33. Oh! the depth, etc. Here first the Apostle bursts into an
   exclamation, which arose spontaneously from a devout consideration of
   God's dealings with the faithful; then in passing he checks the
   boldness of impiety, which is wont to clamor against the judgments of
   God. When therefore we hear, Oh! the depth, this expression of wonder
   ought greatly to avail to the beating down of the presumption of our
   flesh; for after having spoken from the word and by the Spirit of the
   Lord, being at length overcome by the sublimity of so great a mystery,
   he could not do otherwise than wonder and exclaim, that, the riches of
   God's wisdom are deeper than our reason can penetrate to. Whenever then
   we enter on a discourse respecting the eternal counsels of God, let a
   bridle be always set on our thoughts and tongue, so that after having
   spoken soberly and within the limits of God's word, our reasoning may
   at last end in admiration. Nor ought we to be ashamed, that if we are
   not wiser than he, who, having been taken into the third heaven, saw
   mysteries to man ineffable, and who yet could find in this instance no
   other end designed but that he should thus humble himself.

   Some render the words of Paul thus, "Oh! the deep riches, and wisdom,
   and knowledge of God!" as though the word bathos was an adjective; and
   they take riches for abundance, but this seems to me strained, and I
   have therefore no doubt but that he extols God's deep riches of wisdom
   and knowledge. [374]

   How incomprehensible, etc. By different words, according to a practice
   common in Hebrew, he expresses the same thing. For he speaks of
   judgments, then he subjoins ways, which mean appointments or the mode
   of acting, or the manner of ruling. But he still continues his
   exclamation, and thus the more he elevates the height of the divine
   mystery, the more he deters us from the curiosity of investigating it.
   Let us then learn to make no searchings respecting the Lord, except as
   far as he has revealed himself in the Scriptures; for otherwise we
   shall enter a labyrinth, from which the retreat is not easy. It must
   however be noticed, that he speaks not here of all God's mysteries, but
   of those which are hid with God himself, and ought to be only admired
   and adored by us.

   34. Who has known the mind of the Lord? He begins here to extend as it
   were his hand to restrain the audacity of men, lest they should clamor
   against God's judgments, and this he does by stating two reasons: the
   first is, that all mortals are too blind to take a view of God's
   predestination by their own understanding, and to reason on a thing
   unknown is presumptuous and absurd; the other is, that we can have no
   cause of complaint against God, since no mortal can boast that God is a
   debtor to him; but that, on the contrary, all are under obligations to
   him for his bounty. [375]

   Within this limit then let every one remember to keep his own mind,
   lest he be carried beyond God's oracles in investigating
   predestination, since we hear that man can distinguish nothing in this
   case, any more than a blind man in darkness. This caution, however, is
   not to be so applied as to weaken the certainty of faith, which
   proceeds not from the acumen of the human mind, but solely from the
   illumination of the Spirit; for Paul himself in another place, after
   having testified that all the mysteries of God far exceed the
   comprehension of our minds, immediately subjoins that the faithful
   understand the mind of the Lord, because they have not received the
   spirit of this world, but the Spirit which has been given them by God,
   by whom they are instructed as to his goodness, which otherwise would
   be incomprehensible to them.

   As then we cannot by our own faculties examine the secrets of God, so
   we are admitted into a certain and clear knowledge of them by the grace
   of the Holy Spirit: and if we ought to follow the guidance of the
   Spirit, where he leaves us, there we ought to stop and as it were to
   fix our standing. If any one will seek to know more than what God has
   revealed, he shall be overwhelmed with the immeasurable brightness of
   inaccessible light. But we must bear in mind the distinction, which I
   have before mentioned, between the secret counsel of God, and his will
   made known in Scripture; for though the whole doctrine of Scripture
   surpasses in its height the mind of man, yet an access to it is not
   closed against the faithful, who reverently and soberly follow the
   Spirit as their guide; but the case is different with regard to his
   hidden counsel, the depth and height of which cannot by any
   investigation be reached.

   35. Who has first given to him, etc. Another reason, by which God's
   righteousness is most effectually defended against all the accusations
   of the ungodly: for if no one retains him bound to himself by his own
   merits, no one can justly expostulate with him for not having received
   his reward; as he, who would constrain another to do him good, must
   necessarily adduce those deeds by which he has deserved a reward. The
   import then of Paul's words is this -- "God cannot be charged with
   unrighteousness, except it can be proved, that he renders not to every
   one his due: but it is evident, that no one is deprived by him of his
   right, since he is under obligation to none; for who can boast of any
   thing of his own, by which he has deserved his favor?" [376]

   Now this is a remarkable passage; for we are here taught, that it is
   not in our power to constrain God by our good works to bestow salvation
   on us, but that he anticipates the undeserving by his gratuitous
   goodness. But if we desire to make an honest examination, we shall not
   only find, that God is in no way a debtor to us, but that we are all
   subject to his judgment, -- that we not only deserve no layout, but
   that we are worthy of eternal death. And Paul not only concludes, that
   God owes us nothing, on account of our corrupt and sinful nature; but
   he denies, that if man were perfect, he could bring anything before
   God, by which he could gain his favor; for as soon as he begins to
   exist, he is already by the right of creation so much indebted to his
   Maker, that he has nothing of his own. In vain then shall we try to
   take from him his own right, that he should not, as he pleases, freely
   determine respecting his own creatures, as though there was mutual debt
   and credit.

   36. For from him and through him, etc. A confirmation of the last
   verse. He shows, that it is very far from being the case, that we can
   glory in any good thing of our own against God, since we have been
   created by him from nothing, and now exist through him. He hence
   infers, that our being should be employed for his glory: for how
   unreasonable would it be for creatures, whom he has formed and whom he
   sustains, to live for any other purpose than for making his glory
   known? It has not escaped my notice, that the phrase, eis auton, to
   him, is sometimes taken for en auto, in or by him, but improperly: and
   as its proper meaning is more suitable to the present subject, it is
   better to retain it, than to adopt that which is improper. The import
   of what is said is, -- That the whole order of nature would be
   strangely subverted, were not God, who is the beginning of all things,
   the end also.

   To him be glory, etc. The proposition being as it were proved, he now
   confidently assumes it as indubitable, -- That the Lord's own glory
   ought everywhere to continue to him unchangeably: for the sentence
   would be frigid were it taken generally; but its emphasis depends on
   the context, that. God justly claims for himself absolute supremacy,
   and that in the condition of mankind and of the whole world nothing is
   to be sought beyond his own glory. It hence follows, that absurd and
   contrary to reason, and even insane, are all those sentiments which
   tend to diminish his glory.

   [372] "Incomprehensibilia," so the Vulgate; "anexereuneta --
   inscrutabilia -- inscrutable," Beza. It means what cannot be found out
   by searching. Our version conveys the correct idea -- "unsearchable."
   -- Ed.

   [373] "Impervestigabiles," so Beza; "anexichniastoi -- investigabiles
   -- ininvestigable," Vulgate; what cannot be investigated, and of which
   there are no footsteps -- untraceable; "cannot be traced out" is the
   version of Doddridge. -- Ed.

   [374] It has indeed been thought by many that ploutou, riches, is a
   noun belonging to wisdom and knowledge, used, after the Hebrew manner,
   instead of an adjective. It means abundance or exuberance. The
   sentence, according to our idiom, would then be, "O the profundity of
   the abounding wisdom and knowledge of God!" The Apostle, as in the
   words, "the gifts and calling of God," adopts an ascending scale, and
   mentions wisdom first, and then knowledge, which in point of order
   precedes it. Then in the following clause, according to his usual
   practice, he retrogrades, and states first what belongs to knowledge --
   "judgments," decisions, divine decrees, such as knowledge determines;
   and then "ways," actual proceedings, for the guiding of which wisdom is
   necessary. Thus we see that his style is thoroughly Hebraistic. It
   appears from Poole's Syn., that Origen, Chrysostom, and Theodoret
   connected "riches" with "depth," "O the abounding depth," etc.; but
   that Ambrose and Augustine connected it with "wisdom," etc. The use of
   the term in Ephesians 1:7, favors the last; for "the riches of his
   grace" mean clearly "his abounding grace." But some, with Stuart,
   suppose that by "riches" here is meant God's goodness or mercy,
   according to Romans 11:12, and Ephesians 3:8. And Stuart gives this
   version, "O the boundless goodness, and wisdom, and knowledge of God!"
   But this destroys the evident correspondence that is to be found in the
   latter clause of the verse, except we take in the remaining portion of
   the chapter, and this perhaps is what ought to be done. But if we do
   this, then ploutou means "treasures, or blessings," or copia
   beneficiorum," as Schleusner expresses it. "Riches of Christ" mean the
   abounding blessings laid up in him, Ephesians 3:8. God may be viewed as
   set forth here as the source of all things, and as infinite in wisdom
   and knowledge; and these three things are the subjects to the end of
   the chapter, the two last verses referring to the first, and the end of
   the thirty-third and the thirty-fourth to the two others, and in an
   inverted order. The depth or vastness of his wealth or bounty is such,
   that he has nothing but his own, no one having given him anything,
   (Romans 11:35,) and from him, and through him, and to him are all
   things, (Romans 11:36.) Then as to the vastness of his wisdom and of
   his knowledge; what his knowledge has decided cannot be searched out,
   and what his wisdom has devised, as to the manner of executing his
   purposes, cannot be investigated; and no one can measure the extent of
   his knowledge, and no one has been his counselor, so as to add to the
   stores of his wisdom, (Romans 11:34.) That we may see the whole passage
   in lines -- 33. Oh the depth of God's bounty and wisdom and knowledge!^
   How inscrutable his judgments^
   And untraceable his ways! 34. Who indeed hath known the Lord's mind,^
   Or who has become his counselor? 35. Or who has first given to him?^
   And it shall be repayed to him: 36. For from him and through him and to
   him are all things:^
   To him the glory for ever. -- Amen. -- Ed.

   [375] The words of this verse seem to have been taken literally from
   Isaiah 40:13, as given in the Septuagint. The Hebrew is in some measure
   different, but the words will admit of a rendering approaching nearer
   to the meaning here than what is presented in our version, as follows
   -- Who has weighed the spirit of Jehovah,^
   And, being a man of his counsel, has taught him? To "weigh the spirit"
   is to know it thoroughly: the same verb, tkn, is used in this sense in
   Proverbs 16:2; Proverbs 24:12. It indeed means to compute by measure or
   by weight; so that it may be rendered "measure" as well as "weigh," and
   if we adopt "measure," it will then appear that to "know the mind of
   the Lord," is to know the extent of his understanding or knowledge; an
   idea which remarkably corresponds with the passage. -- Ed.

   [376] There is a passage in Job 41:11, 12, (in the Hebrew Bible,) of
   which this verse seems to be a translation, made by the Apostle
   himself, as totally another meaning is given in the Septuagint. The
   person is alone changed. The Hebrew is literally this, Who has
   anticipated me,^
   And I will repay? To "anticipate" means here with favor or gift; for
   the remainder of the verse is the following, -- Everything under the
   whole heaven, mine it is. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 12
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 12:1-2

   1. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
   present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
   which is your reasonable service.

   1. Obsecro itaque vos fratres, per miserationes Dei, ut sistatis
   corpora vestra hostiam vivam, sanctam, acceptam Deo, rationabilem
   cultum vestrum.

   2. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
   renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
   acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

   2. Et ne conformetis vos huic mundo, sed transfiguremini renovatione
   mentis vestrae, ut probetis quae sit voluntas Dei bona et placita et
   perfecta.

   After having handled those things necessary for the erection of the
   kingdom of God, -- that righteousness is to be sought from God alone,
   that salvation is to come to us alone from his mercy, that all
   blessings are laid up and daily offered to us in Christ only, -- Paul
   now passes on, according to the best order, to show how the life is to
   be formed. If it be, that through the saving knowledge of God and of
   Christ, the soul is, as it were, regenerated into a celestial life, and
   that the life is in a manner formed and regulated by holy exhortations
   and precepts; it is then in vain that you show a desire to form the
   life aright, except you prove first, that the origin of all
   righteousness in men is in God and Christ; for this is to raise them
   from the dead.

   And this is the main difference between the gospel and philosophy: for
   though the philosophers speak excellently and with great judgment on
   the subject of morals, yet whatever excellency shines forth in their
   precepts, it is, as it were, a beautiful superstructure without a
   foundation; for by omitting principles, they offer a mutilated
   doctrine, like a body without a head. Not very unlike this is the mode
   of teaching under the Papacy: for though they mention, by the way,
   faith in Christ and the grace of the Holy Spirit, it yet appears quite
   evident, that they approach heathen philosophers far nearer than Christ
   and his Apostles.

   But as philosophers, before they lay down laws respecting morals,
   discourse first of the end of what is good, and inquire into the
   sources of virtues, from which afterwards they draw and derive all
   duties; so Paul lays down here the principle from which all the duties
   of holiness flow, even this, -- that we are redeemed by the Lord for
   this end -- that we may consecrate to him ourselves and all our
   members. But it may be useful to examine every part.

   1. I therefore beseech you by the mercies (miserationes -- compassions)
   of God, etc. We know that unholy men, in order to gratify the flesh,
   anxiously lay hold on whatever is set forth in Scripture respecting the
   infinite goodness of God; and hypocrites also, as far as they can,
   maliciously darken the knowledge of it, as though the grace of God
   extinguished the desire for a godly life, and opened to audacity the
   door of sin. But this exhortation teaches us, that until men really
   apprehend how much they owe to the mercy of God, they will never with a
   right feeling worship him, nor be effectually stimulated to fear and
   obey him. It is enough for the Papists, if they can extort by terror
   some sort of forced obedience, I know not what. But Paul, that he might
   bind us to God, not by servile fear, but by the voluntary and cheerful
   love of righteousness, allures us by the sweetness of that favor, by
   which our salvation is effected; and at the same time he reproaches us
   with ingratitude, except we, after having found a Father so kind and
   bountiful, do strive in our turn to dedicate ourselves wholly to him.
   [377]

   And what Paul says, in thus exhorting us, ought to have more power over
   us, inasmuch as he excels all others in setting forth the grace of God.
   Iron indeed must be the heart which is not kindled by the doctrine
   which has been laid down into love towards God, whose kindness towards
   itself it finds to have been so abounding. Where then are they who
   think that all exhortations to a holy life are nullified, if the
   salvation of men depends on the grace of God alone, since by no
   precepts, by no sanctions, is a pious mind so framed to render
   obedience to God, as by a serious meditation on the Divine goodness
   towards it?

   We may also observe here the benevolence of the Apostle's spirit, --
   that he preferred to deal with the faithful by admonitions and friendly
   exhortations rather than by strict commands; for he knew that he could
   prevail more with the teachable in this way than in any other.

   That ye present your bodies, etc. It is then the beginning of a right
   course in good works, when we understand that we are consecrated to the
   Lord; for it hence follows, that we must cease to live to ourselves, in
   order that we may devote all the actions of our life to his service.

   There are then two things to be considered here, -- the first, that we
   are the Lord's, -- and secondly, that we ought on this account to be
   holy, for it is an indignity to God's holiness, that anything, not
   first consecrated, should be offered to him. These two things being
   admitted, it then follows that holiness is to be practiced through
   life, and that we are guilty of a kind of sacrilege when we relapse
   into uncleanness, as it is nothing else than to profane what is
   consecrated.

   But there is throughout a great suitableness in the expressions. He
   says first, that our body ought to be offered a sacrifice to God; by
   which he implies that we are not our own, but have entirely passed over
   so as to become the property of God; which cannot be, except we
   renounce ourselves and thus deny ourselves. Then, secondly, by adding
   two adjectives, he shows what sort of sacrifice this ought to be. By
   calling it living, he intimates, that we are sacrificed to the Lord for
   this end, -- that our former life being destroyed in us, we may be
   raised up to a new life. By the term holy, he points out that which
   necessarily belongs to a sacrifice, already noticed; for a victim is
   then only approved, when it had been previously made holy. By the third
   word, acceptable, he reminds us, that our life is framed aright, when
   this sacrifice is so made as to be pleasing to God: he brings to us at
   the same time no common consolation; for he teaches us, that our work
   is pleasing and acceptable to God when we devote ourselves to purity
   and holiness.

   By bodies he means not only our bones and skin, but the whole mass of
   which we are composed; and he adopted this word, that he might more
   fully designate all that we are: for the members of the body are the
   instruments by which we execute our purposes. [378] He indeed requires
   from us holiness, not only as to the body, but also as to the soul and
   spirit, as in 1 Thessalonians 5:23. In bidding us to present our
   bodies, he alludes to the Mosaic sacrifices, which were presented at
   the altar, as it were in the presence of God. But he shows, at the same
   time, in a striking manner, how prompt we ought to be to receive the
   commands of God, that we may without delay obey them.

   Hence we learn, that all mortals, whose object is not to worship God,
   do nothing but miserably wander and go astray. We now also find what
   sacrifices Paul recommends to the Christian Church: for being
   reconciled to God through the one only true sacrifice of Christ, we are
   all through his grace made priests, in order that we may dedicate
   ourselves and all we have to the glory of God. No sacrifice of
   expiation is wanted; and no one can be set up, without casting a
   manifest reproach on the cross of Christ.

   Your reasonable service This sentence, I think, was added, that he
   might more clearly apply and confirm the preceding exhortation, as
   though he had said, -- "Offer yourselves a, sacrifice to God, if ye
   have it in your heart to serve God: for this is the right way of
   serving God; from which, if any depart, they are but false
   worshippers." If then only God is rightly worshipped, when we observe
   all things according to what he has prescribed, away then with all
   those devised modes of worship, which he justly abominates, since he
   values obedience more than sacrifice. Men are indeed pleased with their
   own inventions, which have an empty show of wisdom, as Paul says in
   another place; but we learn here what the celestial Judge declares in
   opposition to this by the mouth of Paul; for by calling that a
   reasonable service which he commands, he repudiates as foolish,
   insipid, and presumptuous, whatever we attempt beyond the rule of his
   word. [379]

   2. And conform ye not to this world, etc. The term world has several
   significations, but here it means the sentiments and the morals of men;
   to which, not without cause, he forbids us to conform. For since the
   whole world lies in wickedness, it behooves us to put off whatever we
   have of the old man, if we would really put on Christ: and to remove
   all doubt, he explains what he means, by stating what is of a contrary
   nature; for he bids us to be transformed into a newness of mind. These
   kinds of contrast are common in Scripture; and thus a subject is more
   clearly set forth.

   Now attend here, and see what kind of renovation is required from us:
   It is not that of the flesh only, or of the inferior part of the soul,
   as the Sorbonists explain this word; but of the mind, which is the most
   excellent part of us, and to which philosophers ascribe the supremacy;
   for they call it hegemonikon, the leading power; and reason is imagined
   to be a most wise queen. But Paul pulls her down from her throne, and
   so reduces her to nothing by teaching us that we must be renewed in
   mind. For how much soever we may flatter ourselves, that declaration of
   Christ is still true, -- that every man must be born again, who would
   enter into the kingdom of God; for in mind and heart we are altogether
   alienated from the righteousness of God.

   That ye may prove, [380] etc. Here you have the purpose for which we
   must put on a new mind, -- that bidding adieu to our own counsels and
   desires, and those of all men, we may be attentive to the only will of
   God, the knowledge of which is true wisdom. But if the renovation of
   our mind is necessary, in order that we may prove what is the will of
   God, it is hence evident how opposed it is to God.

   The epithets which are added are intended for the purpose of
   recommending God's will, that we may seek to know it with greater
   alacrity: and in order to constrain our perverseness, it is indeed
   necessary that the true glory of justice and perfection should be
   ascribed to the will of God. The world persuades itself that those
   works which it has devised are good; Paul exclaims, that what is good
   and right must be ascertained from God's commandments. The world
   praises itself, and takes delight in its own inventions; but Paul
   affirms, that nothing pleases God except what he has commanded. The
   world, in order to find perfection, slides from the word of God into
   its own devices; Paul, by fixing perfection in the will of God, shows,
   that if any one passes over that mark he is deluded by a false
   imagination.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [377] By "mercies," the Apostle refers, as some think, to the various
   sects of God's mercy, such as election, vocation, justification, and
   final salvation. Grotius considers that God's attributes are referred
   to, such as are described in Exodus 34:6,7. Erasmus, quoting Origen,
   says, that the plural is used for amplification, in order to show the
   greatness of God's mercy, as though the Apostle had said, "by God's
   great mercy." Schleusner renders the clause, "per summam Dei
   benignitatem -- by God's great kindness," that is, in bringing you to
   the knowledge of the gospel. So "Father of mercies," in 2 Corinthians
   1:3, may mean "most merciful Father," or the meaning may be, "the
   Father of all blessings," as mercy signifies sometimes what mercy
   bestows, (Philippians 2:1,) as grace or favor often means the gift
   which flows from it. According to this view, "mercies" here are the
   blessings which God bestows, even the blessings of redemption. -- Ed.

   [378] The word somata, "bodies," he seems to have used, because of the
   similitude he adopts respecting sacrifices; for the bodies of beasts we
   are to consecrate our own bodies. As he meant before by "members,"
   chapter 6:13, the whole man, so he means here by "bodies," that is,
   themselves. They were to be living sacrifices, not killed as the legal
   sacrifices, they were to be holy, not maimed or defective, but whole
   and perfect as to all the members, and free from disease. See Leviticus
   22:19-22. They were to be acceptable, eua'reston; "placentem --
   pleasing," Beza; "well-pleasing," Doddridge. It was not sufficient
   under the law for the sacrifices themselves to be holy, blameless, such
   as God required; but a right motive and a right feeling on the part of
   the offerer were necessary, in order that they might be accepted or
   approved by God. Without faith and repentance, and a reformed life,
   they were not accepted, but regarded as abominations. See Psalm 51:19;
   Isaiah 1:11-19 It is said by Wolfius, that all the terms here are
   derived from the sacrificial rites of the law, and that Christians are
   represented both as the priests who offered, and as the sacrifices
   which were offered by them. -- Ed.

   [379] The word logiken, "reasonable," was considered by Origen, and by
   many after him, as designating Christian service consonant with reason,
   in opposition to the sacrifices under the law, which were not agreeable
   to reason. But Chrysostom, whom also many have followed, viewed the
   word as meaning what is spiritual, or what belongs to the mind, in
   contradistinction to the ritual and external service of the law; but
   there is no example of the word having such a meaning, except it be 1
   Peter 2:2, which is by no means decisive. Rational, or reasonable, is
   its meaning, or, what agrees with the word, as Phavorinus explains it.
   There is no need here to suppose any contrast: the expression only
   designates the act or the service which the Apostle prescribes; as
   though he said, "What I exhort you to do is nothing but a reasonable
   service, consistent with the dictates of reason. God has done great
   things for you, and it is nothing but right and just that you should
   dedicate yourselves wholly to him." This seems to be the obvious
   meaning. To draw this expression to another subject, in order to set up
   reason as an umpire in matters of faith, is wholly a perversion: and to
   say, that as it seems to refer to the word in 1 Peter 2:2, it must be
   so considered here, is what does not necessarily follow; for as logos
   sometimes means "word," and sometimes "reason," so its derivative may
   have a similar variety. -- Ed.

   [380] Ut probetis, eis to dokimazein humas; "ut noscatis -- that ye may
   know," Theophylact; "ut diligenter scrutemini -- that ye may carefully
   search," Jerome, "That ye may experimentally know," Doddridge; "that ye
   may learn," Stuart. The verb means chiefly three things, -- to test,
   i.e., metals by fire, to try, to prove, to examine, 1 Peter 1:7; Luke
   14:19; 2 Corinthians 13:5, -- to approve what is proved, Romans 14:22;
   1 Corinthians 16:3, -- and also to prove a thing so as to make a proper
   distinction, to discern, to understand, to distinguish, Luke 12:56;
   Romans 2:18. The last idea is the most suitable here, "in order that ye
   may understand what the will of God is, even that which is good and
   acceptable and perfect." What Stuart says on the last clause seems
   just, that it is to be taken by itself, and that the words do not agree
   with "will," but stand by themselves, being in the neuter gender.
   Otherwise we cannot affix any idea to "acceptable;" for it would be
   unsuitable to say that God's will is "acceptable" to him, that being
   self-evident. "Good," agathon, is useful, advantageous, beneficial;
   "acceptable," euareston, is what is pleasing to and accepted by God;
   and "perfect," teleion, is complete, entire, without any defect, or
   just and right. It ought to be borne in mind, as Pareus observes, that
   in order to discern, and rightly to understand God's will, the Apostle
   teaches us, that "the renewing of the mind" is necessary; otherwise, as
   he adds, "our corrupt nature will fascinate our eyes that they may not
   see, or if they see, will turn our hearts and wills, that they may not
   approve, or if they approve, will hinder us to follow what is
   approved." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 12:3

   3. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
   among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think;
   but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the
   measure of faith.

   3. Dico enim per gratiam, quae data est mihi, cuilibet vestrum, ne
   supra modum sapiat praeter id quod oportet sapere, sed sapiat ad
   sobrietatem, sicuti unicuique distribuit Deus mensuram fidei.

   3. For I say, through the grace, etc. If you think not the causal
   particle superfluous, this verse will not be unsuitably connected with
   the former; for since he wished that our whole study should be employed
   in investigating the will of God, the next thing to this was, to draw
   us away from vain curiosity. As however the causal particle is often
   used redundantly by Paul, you may take the verse as containing a simple
   affirmation; for thus the sense would also be very appropriate.

   But before he specifies his command, he reminds them of the authority
   which had been given to him, so that they might not otherwise attend to
   his voice than if it was the voice of God himself; for his words are
   the same, as though he had said, "I speak not of myself; but, as God's
   ambassador, I bring to you the commands which he has entrusted to me."
   By "grace" (as before) he means the Apostleship, with respect to which
   he exalts God's kindness, and at the same time intimates, that he had
   not crept in through his own presumption, but, that he was chosen by
   the calling of God. Having then by this preface secured authority to
   himself, he laid the Romans under the necessity of obeying, unless they
   were prepared to despise God in the person of his minister.

   Then the command follows, by which he draws us away from the
   investigation of those things which can bring nothing but harassment to
   the mind, and no edification; and he forbids every one to assume more
   than what his capacity and calling will allow; and at the same time he
   exhorts us to think and meditate on those things which may render us
   sober-minded and modest. For so I understand the words, rather than in
   the sense given by Erasmus, who thus renders them, "Let no one think
   proudly of himself;" for this sense is somewhat remote from the words,
   and the other is more accordant with the context. The clause, Beyond
   what it behooves him to be wise, shows what he meant by the former verb
   huperphronein, to be above measure wise; that is, that we exceed the
   measure of wisdom, if we engage in those things concerning which it is
   not meet that we should be anxious. [381] To be wise unto sobriety is
   to attend to the study of those things by which you may find that you
   learn and gain moderation.

   To every one as God has distributed, etc. (Unicuique ut divisit Deus.)
   There is here an inversion of words, instead of -- As to every one God
   has distributed [382] And here a reason is given for that sober-minded
   wisdom which he had mentioned; for as distribution of graces is
   various, so every one preserves himself within the due boundaries of
   wisdom, who keeps within the limits of that grace of faith bestowed on
   him by the Lord. Hence there is an immoderate affectation of wisdom,
   not only in empty things and in things useless to be known, but also in
   the knowledge of those things which are otherwise useful, when we
   regard not what has been given to us, but through rashness and
   presumption go beyond the measure of our knowledge; and such outrage
   God will not suffer to go unpunished. It is often to be seen, with what
   insane trifles they are led away, who, by foolish ambition, proceed
   beyond those bounds which are set for them. [383]

   The meaning is, that it is a part of our reasonable sacrifice to
   surrender ourselves, in a meek and teachable spirit, to be ruled and
   guided by God. And further, by setting up faith in opposition to human
   judgment, he restrains us from our own opinions, and at the same time
   specifies the due measure of it, that is, when the faithful humbly keep
   themselves within the limits allotted to them. [384]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [381] "Ne supra modum sapiat," so the Vulgate and Beza; me
   huperthronein, "ne supra modum de se sentiat -- let him not think
   immoderately of himself," Mede; "not to arrogate to himself,"
   Doddridge; "not to overestimate himself," Stuart. This and the
   following clause may be thus rendered, "not to think highly above what
   it behooves him to think," that is, of himself. Then what follows may
   admit of this rendering, "but to think so as to think rightly," or
   modestly, (eis to sophronein.) The last verb occurs elsewhere five
   times; thrice it means "to be of a sane mind," Mark 5:15; Luke 8:35; 2
   Corinthians 5:13; and twice it means "to act prudently," Titus 2:6; 1
   Peter 4:7; or, it may be, in the last passage, "to live temperately."
   As it refers here to the mind, it must mean such an estimate of one's
   self as is sound, just, and right, such as becomes one who is sound and
   sane in his mind. Pride is a species of insanity; but humility betokens
   a return to a sane mind: and an humble estimate of ourselves, as
   Professor Hodge observes, is the only sound, sane, and right estimate.
   -- Ed.

   [382] We find a similar transposition in 1 Corinthians 3:5. -- Ed.

   [383] "It is better," says Augustine, "to doubt respecting hidden
   things, than to contend about things uncertain." -- Ed.

   [384] The expression "the measures of faith," metron pisteos, is
   differently explained. Some, as Beza and Pareus, consider "faith" here
   as including religion or Christian truth, because faith is the main
   principle, "as God has divided to each the measure of Christian truth
   or knowledge." Others suppose with Mede, that "faith" here is to be
   taken for those various gifts and endowments which God bestowed on
   those who believed or professed the faith of the gospel; "as God has
   divided to each the measure of those gifts which come by faith, or
   which are given to those who believe." The last view is most suitable
   to the context. We may, however, take, "faith" here for grace, and
   consider the meaning the same as in Ephesians 4:7. The subject there is
   the same as here, for the Apostle proceeds there to mention the
   different offices which Christ had appointed in his Church. -- Ed.

   4. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
   the same office:

   4. Quemadmodum enim in uno corpore membra multa habemus, membra vero
   omnia non eandem habent actionem;

   5. So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one
   of another.

   5. Sic multi unum sumus corpus in Christo membra mutuo alter alterius.

   6. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to
   us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of
   faith;

   6. Habentes autem dona secundum gratiam nobis datam differentia; sive
   prophetiam, secundum analogiam fidei;

   7. Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on
   teaching;

   7. Sive ministerium, in ministerio; sive qui docet, in doctrina;

   8. Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it
   with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy,
   with cheerfulness.

   8. Sive qui exhortatur, in exhortatione; sive qui largitur, in
   simplicitate; sive qui praeest, in studio; sive qui miseretur, in
   hilaritate.

   4. For as in one body, etc. The very thing which he had previously said
   of limiting the wisdom of each according to the measure of faith, he
   now confirms by a reference to the vocation of the faithful; for we are
   called for this end, that we may unite together in one body, since
   Christ has ordained a fellowship and connection between the faithful
   similar to that which exists between the members of the human body; and
   as men could not of themselves come together into such an union, he
   himself becomes the bond of this connection. As then the case is with
   the human body, so it ought to be with the society of the faithful. By
   applying this similitude he proves how necessary it is for each to
   consider what is suitable to his own nature, capacity, and vocation.
   But though this similitude has various parts, it is yet to be chiefly
   thus applied to our present subject, -- that as the members of the same
   body have distinct offices, and all of them are distinct, for no member
   possesses all powers, nor does it appropriate to itself the offices of
   others; so God has distributed various gifts to us, by which diversity
   he has determined the order which he would have to be observed among
   us, so that every one is to conduct himself according to the measure of
   his capacity, and not to thrust himself into what peculiarly belongs to
   others; nor is any one to seek to have all things himself, but to be
   content with his lot, and willingly to abstain from usurping the
   offices of others. When, however, he points out in express words the
   communion which is between us, he at the same time intimates, how much
   diligence there ought to be in all, so that they may contribute to the
   common good of the body according to the faculties they possess. [385]

   6. Having gifts, etc. Paul speaks not now simply of cherishing among
   ourselves brotherly love, but commends humility, which is the best
   moderator of our whole life. Every one desires to have so much himself,
   so as not to need any help from others; but the bond of mutual
   communication is this, that no one has sufficient for himself, but is
   constrained to borrow from others. I admit, then that the society of
   the godly cannot exist, except when each one is content with his own
   measure, and imparts to others the gifts which he has received, and
   allows himself by turns to be assisted by the gifts of others.

   But Paul especially intended to beat down the pride which he knew to be
   innate in men; and that no one might be dissatisfied that all things
   have not been bestowed on him, he reminds us that according to the wise
   counsel of God every one has his own portion given to him; for it is
   necessary to the common benefit of the body that no one should be
   furnished with fullness of gifts, lest he should heedlessly despise his
   brethren. Here then we have the main design which the Apostle had in
   view, that all things do not meet in all, but that the gifts of God are
   so distributed that each has a limited portion, and that each ought to
   be so attentive in imparting his own gifts to the edification of the
   Church, that no one, by leaving his own function, may trespass on that
   of another. By this most beautiful order, and as it were symmetry, is
   the safety of the Church indeed preserved; that is, when every one
   imparts to all in common what he has received from the Lord, in such a
   way as not to impede others. He who inverts this order fights with God,
   by whose ordinance it is appointed; for the difference of gifts
   proceeds not from the will of man, but because it has pleased the Lord
   to distribute his grace in this manner.

   Whether prophecy, etc. By now bringing forward some examples, he shows
   how every one in his place, or as it were in occupying his station,
   ought to be engaged. For all gifts have their own defined limits, and
   to depart from them is to mar the gifts themselves. But the passage
   appears somewhat confused; we may yet arrange it in this manner, "Let
   him who has prophecy, test it by the analogy of faith; let him in the
   ministry discharge it in teaching," [386] etc. They who will keep this
   end in view, will rightly preserve themselves within their own limits.

   But this passage is variously understood. There are those who consider
   that by prophecy is meant the gift of predicting, which prevailed at
   the commencement of the gospel in the Church; as the Lord then designed
   in every way to commend the dignity and excellency of his Church; and
   they think that what is added, according to the analogy of faith, is to
   be applied to all the clauses. But I prefer to follow those who extend
   this word wider, even to the peculiar gift of revelation, by which any
   one skillfully and wisely performed the office of an interpreter in
   explaining the will of God. Hence prophecy at this day in the Christian
   Church is hardly anything else than the right understanding of the
   Scripture, and the peculiar faculty of explaining it, inasmuch as all
   the ancient prophecies and all the oracles of God have been completed
   in Christ and in his gospel. For in this sense it is taken by Paul when
   he says,

   "I wish that you spoke in tongues, but rather that ye prophesy,"
   (1 Corinthians 14:5;)

   "In part we know and in part we prophesy,"
   (1 Corinthians 13:9.)

   And it does not appear that Paul intended here to mention those
   miraculous graces by which Christ at first rendered illustrious his
   gospel; but, on the contrary, we find that he refers only to ordinary
   gifts, such as were to continue perpetually in the Church. [387]

   Nor does it seem to me a solid objection, that the Apostle to no
   purpose laid this injunction on those who, having the Spirit of God,
   could not call Christ an anathema; for he testifies in another place
   that the spirit of the Prophets is subject to the Prophets; and he bids
   the first speaker to be silent, if anything were revealed to him who
   was sitting down, (1 Corinthians 14:32;) and it was for the same reason
   it may be that he gave this admonition to those who prophesied in the
   Church, that is, that they were to conform their prophecies to the rule
   of faith, lest in anything they should deviate from the right line. By
   faith he means the first principles of religion, and whatever doctrine
   is not found to correspond with these is here condemned as false. [388]

   As to the other clauses there is less difficulty. Let him who is
   ordained a minister, he says, execute his office in ministering; nor
   let him think, that he has been admitted into that degree for himself,
   but for others; as though he had said, "Let him fulfill his office by
   ministering faithfully, that he may answer to his name." So also he
   immediately adds with regard to teachers; for by the word teaching, he
   recommends sound edification, according to this import, -- "Let him who
   excels in teaching know what the end is, that the Church may be really
   instructed; and let him study this one thing, that he may render the
   Church more informed by his teaching:" for a teacher is he who forms
   and builds the Church by the word of truth. Let him also who excels in
   the gift of exhorting, have this in view, to render his exhortation
   effectual.

   But these offices have much affinity and even connection; not however
   that they were not different. No one indeed could exhort, except by
   doctrine: yet he who teaches is not therefore endued with the
   qualification to exhort. But no one prophesies or teaches or exhorts,
   without at the same time ministering. But it is enough if we preserve
   that distinction which we find to be in God's gifts, and which we know
   to be adapted to produce order in the Church. [389]

   8. Or he who gives, let him do so in simplicity, etc. From the former
   clauses we have clearly seen, that he teaches us here the legitimate
   use of God's gifts. By the metadidountois, the givers, of whom he
   speaks here, he did not understand those who gave of their own
   property, but the deacons, who presided in dispensing the public
   charities of the Church; and by the elountois, those who showed mercy,
   he meant the widows, and other ministers, who were appointed to take
   care of the sick, according to the custom of the ancient Church: for
   there were two different offices, -- to provide necessaries for the
   poor, and to attend to their condition. But to the first he recommends
   simplicity, so that without fraud or respect of persons they were
   faithfully to administer what was entrusted to them. He required the
   services of the other party to be rendered with cheerfulness, lest by
   their peevishness (which often happens) they marred the favor conferred
   by them. For as nothing gives more solace to the sick or to any one
   otherwise distressed, than to see men cheerful and prompt in assisting
   them; so to observe sadness in the countenance of those by whom
   assistance is given, makes them to feel themselves despised.

   Though he rightly calls those proistamenous presidents, to whom was
   committed the government of the Church, (and they were the elders, who
   presided over and ruled others and exercised discipline;) yet what he
   says of these may be extended universally to all kinds of governors:
   for no small solicitude is required from those who provide for the
   safety of all, and no small diligence is needful for them who ought to
   watch day and night for the wellbeing of the whole community. Yet the
   state of things at that time proves that Paul does not speak of all
   kinds of rulers, for there were then no pious magistrates; but of the
   elders who were the correctors of morals.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [385] The Apostle pursues this likeness of the human body much more at
   large in 1 Corinthians 12:12-31. There are two bonds of union; one,
   which is between the believer and Christ by true faith; and the other,
   which is between the individual member of a church or a congregation
   and the rest of the members by a professed faith. It is the latter that
   is handled by the Apostle, both here and in the Epistle to the
   Corinthians. -- Ed.

   [386] The ellipsis to be supplied here is commonly done as in our
   version, adopted from Beza. The supplement proposed by Pareus is
   perhaps more in unison with the passage; he repeats after "prophecy"
   the words in verse 3, changing the person, "let us think soberly," or
   "let us be modestly wise." -- Ed.

   [387] It is somewhat difficult exactly to ascertain what this
   "prophecy" was. The word "prophet," nvy', means evidently two things in
   the Old Testament and also in the New -- a foreteller and a teacher, or
   rather an interpreter of the word. Prophecy in the New Testament
   sometimes signifies prediction, its primary meaning. Acts 2:17; 2 Peter
   1:21; Revelation 1:3; but most commonly, as it is generally thought,
   the interpretation of prophecy, that is, of prophecies contained in the
   Old Testament, and for this work there were some in the primitive
   Church, as it is supposed, who were inspired, and thus peculiarly
   qualified. It is probable that this kind of prophecy is what is meant
   here. See 1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 13:2,8; 1 Corinthians
   14:3,6,22; 1 Thessalonians 5:20 That this was a distinct function from
   that of apostles, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, is evident from
   Ephesians 4:11; and from the interpretation of tongues, as it appears
   from 1 Corinthians 12:10; and from revelation, knowledge, and doctrine,
   as we find from 1 Corinthians 14:6. It also appears that it was more
   useful than other extraordinary gifts, as it tended more to promote
   edification and comfort, 1 Corinthians 14:1,3. It is hence most
   probable that it was the gift already stated, that of interpreting the
   Scriptures, especially the prophecies of the Old Testament, and
   applying them for the edification of the Church. "Prophets" are put
   next to "apostles" in Ephesians 4:11. -- Ed.

   [388] "Secundum analogiam fidei," so Pareus; kata ten analogian tes
   pisteos; "pro proportione fidei -- according to the proportions of
   faith," Beza, Piscator; that is, as the former explains the phrase,
   "according to the measure or extent of the individual's faith;" he was
   not to go beyond what he knew or what had been communicated to him by
   the Spirit. But the view which Calvin takes is the most obvious and
   consistent with the passage; and this is the view which Hammond gives,
   "according to that form of faith or wholesome doctrine by which every
   one who is sent out to preach the gospel is appointed to regulate his
   preaching, according to those heads or principles of faith and good
   life which are known among you." The word analogia means properly
   congruity, conformity, or proportion, not in the sense of measure or
   extent, but of equality, as when one thing is equal or comformable to
   another; hence the analogy of faith must mean what is conformable to
   the faith. And faith here evidently signifies divine truth, the object
   of faith, or what faith receives. See Romans 10:8; Galatians 3:23;
   Titus 1:4; Jude 1:3. -- Ed.

   [389] Critics have found it difficult to distinguish between these
   offices. The word diakonia, ministry is taken sometimes in a restricted
   sense, as meaning deaconship, an office appointed to manage the
   temporal affairs of the Church, Acts 6:1-3; 1 Timothy 3:8-13; and
   sometimes in a general sense, as signifying the ministerial office, 2
   Corinthians 6:3; Ephesians 3:7; Colossians 1:23. As the "teacher" and
   "exhorter" are mentioned, some think that the deaconship is to be
   understood here, and that the Apostle first mentioned the highest
   office, next to the apostleship -- prophecy, and the lowest -- the
   deaconship, and afterwards named the intervening offices -- those of
   teachers and exhorters. But what are we to think of those mentioned in
   the following clauses? Stuart thinks that they were not public
   officers, but private individuals, and he has sustained this opinion by
   some very cogent reasons. The form of the sentence is here changed; and
   the Apostle, having mentioned the deaconship, cannot be supposed to
   have referred to the same again. The word that seems to stand in the
   way of this view is what is commonly rendered "ruler," or, "he who
   rules:" but ho proistamenos, as our author shows, means a helper, an
   assistant, (see Romans 16:2,) as well as a ruler; it means to stand
   over, either for the purpose of taking care of, assisting, protecting
   others, or of presiding over, ruling, guiding them. Then en spoudho,
   with promptness or diligence, will better agree with the former than
   with the latter idea. The other two clauses correspond also more with
   this view than with the other. It has been said, that if a distributor
   of alms had been intended, the word would have been diadidous and not
   metadidous. See Ephesians 4:28. The expression haploteti, means "with
   liberality, or liberally." See 2 Corinthians 8:2; 2 Corinthians
   9:11,13; James 1:5. -- Ed.

   Romans 12:9-13

   9. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave
   to that which is good.

   9. Dilectio sit non simulata; sitis aversantes malum, adherentes bono;

   10. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour
   preferring one another;

   10. Fraterna charitate ad vos mutuo amandos propensi, alii alios honore
   paevenientes;

   11. Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

   11. Studio non pigri, spiritu ferventes, tempori servientes;

   12. Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in
   prayer;

   12. Spe gaudientes, in tribulatione patientes, in oratione
   perseverantes;

   13. Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

   13. Necessitatibus sanctorum communicantes, hospitalitatem sectantes.

   9. Let love be, etc. Proceeding now to speak of particular duties, he
   fitly begins with love, which is the bond of perfection. And respecting
   this he enjoins what is especially necessary, that all disguises are to
   be cast aside, and that love is to arise from pure sincerity of mind.
   It is indeed difficult to express how ingenious almost all men are to
   pretend a love which they really have not, for they not only deceive
   others, but impose also on themselves, while they persuade themselves
   that those are not loved amiss by them, whom they not only neglect, but
   really slight. Hence Paul declares here, that love is no other but that
   which is free from all dissimulation: and any one may easily be a
   witness to himself, whether he has anything in the recesses of his
   heart which is opposed to love. [390] The words good and evil, which
   immediately follow in the context, have not here a general meaning; but
   evil is to be taken for that malicious wickedness by which an injury is
   done to men; and good for that kindness, by which help is rendered to
   them; and there is here an antithesis usual in Scripture, when vices
   are first forbidden and then virtues enjoined.

   As to the participle, apostugountes, I have followed neither Erasmus
   nor the old translators, who have rendered it "hating," (odio
   habentes;) for in my judgment Paul intended to express something more;
   and the meaning of the term "turning away," corresponds better with the
   opposite clause; for he not only bids us to exercise kindness, but even
   to cleave to it.

   10. With brotherly love, etc. By no words could he satisfy himself in
   setting forth the ardor of that love, with which we ought to embrace
   one another: for he calls it brotherly, and its emotion storgen,
   affection, which, among the Latins, is the mutual affection which
   exists between relatives; and truly such ought to be that which we
   should have towards the children of God. [391] That this may be the
   case, he subjoins a precept very necessary for the preservation of
   benevolence, -- that every one is to give honor to his brethren and not
   to himself; for there is no poison more effectual in alienating the
   minds of men than the thought, that one is despised. But if by honor
   you are disposed to understand every act of friendly kindness, I do not
   much object: I however approve more of the former interpretation. For
   as there is nothing more opposed to brotherly concord than contempt,
   arising from haughtiness, when each one, neglecting others, advances
   himself; so the best fomenter of love is humility, when every one
   honors others.

   11. Not slothful in business, etc. This precept is given to us, not
   only because a Christian life ought to be an active life; but because
   it often becomes us to overlook our own benefit, and to spend our
   labors in behalf of our brethren. In a word, we ought in many things to
   forget ourselves; for except we be in earnest, and diligently strive to
   shake off all sloth, we shall never be rightly prepared for the service
   of Christ. [392]

   By adding fervent in spirit, he shows how we are to attain the former;
   for our flesh, like the ass, is always torpid, and has therefore need
   of goals; and it is only the fervency of the Spirit that can correct
   our slothfulness. Hence diligence in doing good requires that zeal
   which the Spirit of God kindles in our hearts. Why then, some one may
   say, does Paul exhort us to cultivate this fervency? To this I answer,
   -- that though it be the gift of God, it is yet a duty enjoined the
   faithful to shake off sloth, and to cherish the flame kindled by
   heaven, as it for the most part happens, that the Spirit is suppressed
   and extinguished through our fault.

   To the same purpose is the third particular, serving the time: for as
   the course of our life is short, the opportunity of doing good soon
   passes away; it hence becomes us to show more alacrity in the
   performance of our duty. So Paul bids us in another place to redeem the
   time, because the days are evil. The meaning may also be, that we ought
   to know how to accommodate ourselves to the time, which is a matter of
   great importance. But Paul seems to me to set in opposition to idleness
   what he commands as to the serving of time. But as kurio, the Lord, is
   read in many old copies, though it may seem at first sight foreign to
   this passage, I yet dare not wholly to reject this reading. And if it
   be approved, Paul, I have no doubt, meant to refer the duties to be
   performed towards brethren, and whatever served to cherish love, to a
   service done to God, that he might add greater encouragement to the
   faithful. [393]

   12. Rejoicing in hope, etc. Three things are here connected together,
   and seem in a manner to belong to the clause "serving the time;" for
   the person who accommodates himself best to the time, and avails
   himself of the opportunity of actively renewing his course, is he who
   derives his joy from the hope of future life, and patiently bears
   tribulations. However this may be, (for it matters not much whether you
   regard them as connected or separated,) he first; forbids us to
   acquiesce in present blessings, and to ground our joy on earth and on
   earthly things, as though our happiness were based on them; and he bids
   us to raise our minds up to heaven, that we may possess solid and full
   joy. If our joy is derived from the hope of future life, then patience
   will grow up in adversities; for no kind of sorrow will be able to
   overwhelm this joy. Hence these two things are closely connected
   together, that is, joy derived from hope, and patience in adversities.
   No man will indeed calmly and quietly submit to bear the cross, but he
   who has learnt to seek his happiness beyond this world, so as to
   mitigate and allay the bitterness of the cross with the consolation of
   hope.

   But as both these things are far above our strength, we must be instant
   in prayer, and continually call on God, that he may not suffer our
   hearts to faint and to be pressed down, or to be broken by adverse
   events. But Paul not only stimulates us to prayer, but expressly
   requires perseverance; for we have a continual warfare, and new
   conflicts daily arise, to sustain which, even the strongest are not
   equal, unless they frequently gather new rigor. That we may not then be
   wearied, the best remedy is diligence in prayer.

   13. Communicating to the necessities, [394] etc. He returns to the
   duties of love; the chief of which is to do good to those from whom we
   expect the least recompense. As then it commonly happens, that they are
   especially despised who are more than others pressed down with want and
   stand in need of help, (for the benefits conferred on them are regarded
   as lost,) God recommends them to us in an especial manner. It is indeed
   then only that we prove our love to be genuine, when we relieve needy
   brethren, for no other reason but that of exercising our benevolence.
   Now hospitality is not one of the least acts of love; that is, that
   kindness and liberality which are shown towards strangers, for they are
   for the most part destitute of all things, being far away from their
   friends: he therefore distinctly recommends this to us. We hence see,
   that the more neglected any one commonly is by men, the more attentive
   we ought to be to his wants.

   Observe also the suitableness of the expression, when he says, that we
   are to communicate to the necessities of the saints; by which he
   implies, that we ought so to relieve the wants of the brethren, as
   though we were relieving our own selves. And he commands us to assist
   especially the saints: for though our love ought to extend itself to
   the whole race of man, yet it ought with peculiar feeling to embrace
   the household of faith, who are by a closer bond united to us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [390] "Love," says an old author, "is the sum and substance of all
   virtues. Philosophers make justice the queen of virtues; but love is
   the mother of justice, for it renders to God and to our neighbor what
   is justly due to them." -- Ed.

   [391] It is difficult to render this clause: Calvin's words are,
   "Fraterna charitate ad vos mutuo amandos propensi;" so Beza. The
   Apostle joins two things -- mutual love of brethren, with the natural
   love of parents and children, as though he said, "Let your brotherly
   love have in it the affectionate feelings which exists between parents
   and children." "In brotherly love, be mutually full of tender
   affection," Doddridge. "In brotherly love, be kindly disposed toward
   each other," Macknight. It may be thus rendered, "In brotherly love, be
   tenderly affectionate to one another." Calvin's version of the next
   clause is, "Alii alios honore praevenientes;" so Erasmus; tho timho
   allelous proegoumenoi; "honore alii aliis praeuntes -- in honor (that
   is, in conceding honor) going before one another," Beza, Piscator,
   Macknight. It is thus explained by Mede, "Wait not for honor from
   others, but be the first to concede it." The participle means to take
   the lead of, or outrunning, one another." See Philippians 2:3 -- Ed.

   [392] "Studio non pigri," tho spoudho me okneroi; "Be not slothful in
   haste," that is, in a matter requiring haste. "We must strive," says
   Theophylact, "to assist with promptness those whose circumstances
   require immediate help and relief." -- Ed

   [393] The balance of evidence, according to Griesbach, is in favor, of
   to kairo, "time," though there is much, too, which countenances the
   other reading. Luther, Erasmus, and Hammond prefer the former, while
   Beza, Piscator, Pareus, and most of the moderns, the latter. The most
   suitable to the context is the former. -- Ed.

   [394] There is here an instance of the depravation of the text by some
   of the fathers, such as Ambrose, Hilary, Pelagius, Optatus, etc., who
   substituted mneias, monuments, for chreias, necessities, or wants: but
   though there are a few copies which have this reading, yet it has been
   discarded by most; it is not found in the Vulgate, nor approved by
   Erasmus nor Grotius. The word was introduced evidently, as Whitby
   intimates, to countenance the superstition of the early Church
   respecting the monuments or sepulchres of martyrs and confessors. The
   fact, that there were no monuments of martyrs at this time in Rome, was
   wholly overlooked. -- Ed.

   Romans 12:14-16

   14. Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

   14. Benedicite iis qui vos persequuntur; benedicite et ne malum
   imprecemini.

   15. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

   15. Gaudete cum gaudentibus, flete cum fientibus;

   16. Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but
   condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

   16. Mutuo alii in altos sensu affecti, non arroganter de vobis
   sentientes, sed humilibus vos accommodantes: ne sitis apud vos ipsos
   prudentes.

   14. Bless them, etc. I wish, once for all, to remind the reader, that
   he is not scrupulously to seek a precise order as to the precepts here
   laid down, but must be content to have short precepts, unconnected,
   though suited to the formation of a holy life, and such as are deduced
   from the principle the Apostle laid down at the beginning of the
   chapter.

   He will presently give direction respecting the retaliation of the
   injuries which we may suffer: but here he requires something even more
   difficult, -- that we are not to imprecate evils on our enemies, but to
   wish and to pray God to render all things prosperous to them, how much
   soever they may harass and cruelly treat us: and this kindness, the
   more difficult it is to be practiced, so with the more intense desire
   we ought to strive for it; for the Lord commands nothing, with respect
   to which he does not require our obedience; nor is any excuse to be
   allowed, if we are destitute of that disposition, by which the Lord
   would have his people to differ from the ungodly and the children of
   this world.

   Arduous is this, I admit, and wholly opposed to the nature of man; but
   there is nothing too arduous to be overcome by the power of God, which
   shall never be wanting to us, provided we neglect not to seek for it.
   And though you can hardly find one who has made such advances in the
   law of the Lord that he fulfills this precept, yet no one can claim to
   be the child of God or glory in the name of a Christian, who has not in
   part attained this mind, and who does not daily resist the opposite
   disposition.

   I have said that this is more difficult than to let go revenge when any
   one is injured: for though some restrain their hands and are not led
   away by the passion of doing harm, they yet wish that some calamity or
   loss would in some way happen to their enemies; and even when they are
   so pacified that they wish no evil, there is yet hardly one in a
   hundred who wishes well to him from whom he has received an injury;
   nay, most men daringly burst forth into imprecations. But God by his
   word not only restrains our hands from doing evil, but also subdues the
   bitter feelings within; and not only so, but he would have us to be
   solicitous for the wellbeing of those who unjustly trouble us and seek
   our destruction.

   Erasmus was mistaken in the meaning of the verb gein to bless; for he
   did not perceive that it stands opposed to curses and maledictions: for
   Paul would have God in both instances to be a witness of our patience,
   and to see that we not only bridle in our prayers the violence of our
   wrath, but also show by praying for pardon that we grieve at the lot of
   our enemies when they willfully ruin themselves.

   15. Rejoice with those who rejoice, etc. A general truth is in the
   third place laid down, -- that the faithful, regarding each other with
   mutual affection, are to consider the condition of others as their own.
   He first specifies two particular things, -- That they were to "rejoice
   with the joyful, and to weep with the weeping." For such is the nature
   of true love, that one prefers to weep with his brother, rather than to
   look at a distance on his grief, and to live in pleasure or ease. What
   is meant then is, -- that we, as much as possible, ought to sympathize
   with one another, and that, whatever our lot may be, each should
   transfer to himself the feeling of another, whether of grief in
   adversity, or of joy in prosperity. And, doubtless, not to regard with
   joy the happiness of a brother is envy; and not to grieve for his
   misfortunes is inhumanity. Let there be such a sympathy among us as may
   at the same time adapt us to all kinds of feelings.

   16. Not thinking arrogantly of yourselves, [395] etc. The Apostle
   employs words in Greek more significant, and more suitable to the
   antithesis, "Not thinking," he says, "of high things:" by which he
   means, that it is not the part of a Christian ambitiously to aspire to
   those things by which he may excel others, nor to assume a lofty
   appearance, but on the contrary to exercise humility and meekness: for
   by these we excel before the Lord, and not by pride and contempt of the
   brethren. A precept is fitly added to the preceding; for nothing tends
   more to break that unity which has been mentioned, than when we elevate
   ourselves, and aspire to something higher, so that we may rise to a
   higher situation. I take the term humble in the neuter gender, to
   complete the antithesis.

   Here then is condemned all ambition and that elation of mind which
   insinuates itself under the name of magnanimity; for the chief virtue
   of the faithful is moderation, or rather lowliness of mind, which ever
   prefers to give honor to others, rather than to take it away from them.

   Closely allied to this is what is subjoined: for nothing swells the
   minds of men so much as a high notion of their own wisdom. His desire
   then was, that we should lay this aside, hear others, and regard their
   counsels. Erasmus has rendered phronimous, arrogantes -- arrogant; but
   the rendering is strained and frigid; for Paul would in this case
   repeat the same word without any meaning. However, the most appropriate
   remedy for curing arrogance is, that man should not be over-wise in his
   own esteem.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [395] The first clause is omitted. The text of Calvin is, "Mutuo alii
   in alios sensu affecti;" to auto eis allelous phronountes; "Itidem alii
   in alios affecti -- Feel alike towards one another," Beza; "Be entirely
   united in your regards for each other," Doddridge; "Be of the same
   disposition towards one another," Macknight. The verb means to think,
   or to feel, or to mind, in the sense of attending to, or aspiring after
   a thing. It is used also in the next clause, evidently in the last
   sense, minding. There is no reason why its meaning should be different
   here; it would then be, "Mind the same things towards one another,"
   that is, Do to others what you expect others to do to you. It is to
   reduce to an axiom what is contained in the former verse. We may indeed
   give this version, "Feel the same, or alike towards one another," that
   is, sympathize with one another: and this would still be coincident in
   meaning with the former verse; and it would be in accordance with the
   Apostle's mode of writing. But another construction has been given,
   "Think the same of one another," that is, Regard one another alike in
   dignity and privilege as Christians, without elevating yourselves, and
   viewing yourselves better than others. This would well agree with the
   sentence which follows. The two following clauses are thus given by
   Doddridge, "Affect not high things, but condescend to men of low rank,"
   -- and by Macknight, "Do not care for high things; but associate with
   lowly men." The word tapeinois, is not found in the New Testament to be
   applied to things, but to persons. "Associate" is perhaps the best
   rendering of sunapagomenoi, which literally means to withdraw from one
   party in order to walk with another: they were to withdraw from those
   who minded high things, and walk or associate with the humble and
   lowly. "And cleave to the humble," is the Syriac version. -- Ed.

   Romans 12:17-19

   17. Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
   sight of all men.

   17. Nemini malum pro malo rependentes, providentes bona coram omnibus
   hominibus.

   18. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
   men.

   18. Si fieri potest, quantum est in vobis, cum omnibus hominibus pacem
   habentes;

   19. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
   wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
   Lord.

   19. Non vosmetipsos ulciscentes, dilecti; sed date locum irae; scriptum
   est enim, Mihi vindictam, et ego rependam, dicit Dominus.

   17. Repaying to no one, etc. This differs but little from what shortly
   after follows, except that revenge is more than the kind of repaying of
   which he speaks here; for we render evil for evil sometimes, even when
   we exact not the requiting of an injury, as when we treat unkindly
   those who do us no good. We are indeed wont to form an estimate of the
   deserts of each, or of what they merit at our hands, so that we may
   confer our benefits on those, by whom we have been already obliged, or
   from whom we expect something: and again, when any one denies help to
   us when we need it, we, by returning like for like, as they say, do not
   help him in time of need, any more than he assisted us. There are also
   other instances of the same kind, in which evil is rendered for evil,
   when there is no open revenge.

   Providing good things, etc. I no not disapprove of the rendering of
   Erasmus, "Providently preparing," (Provide parantes;) but I prefer a
   literal rendering. As every one is more than justly devoted to his own
   advantage, and provident in avoiding losses, Paul seems to require a
   care and an attention of another kind. What is meant is, that we ought
   diligently to labor, that all may be edified by our honest dealings.
   For as purity of conscience is necessary for us before God, so
   uprightness of character before men is not to be neglected: for since
   it is meet that God should be glorified by our good deeds, even so much
   is wanting to his glory, as there is a deficiency of what is
   praiseworthy in us; and not only the glory of God is thus obscured, but
   he is branded with reproach; for whatever sin we commit, the ignorant
   employ it for the purpose of calumniating the gospel.

   But when we are bidden to prepare good things before men, [396] we must
   at the same time notice for what purpose: it is not indeed that men may
   admire and praise us, as this is a desire which Christ carefully
   forbids us to indulge, since he bids us to admit God alone as the
   witness of our good deeds, to the exclusion of all men; but that their
   minds being elevated to God, they may give praise to him, that by our
   example they may be stirred up to the practice of righteousness, that
   they may, in a word, perceive the good and the sweet odor of our life,
   by which they may be allured to the love of God. But if we are evil
   spoken of for the name of Christ, we are by no means to neglect to
   provide good things before men: for fulfilled then shall be that
   saying, that we are counted as false, and are yet true. (2 Corinthians
   6:8.)

   18. If it be possible, etc. Peaceableness and a life so ordered as to
   render us beloved by all, is no common gift in a Christian. If we
   desire to attain this, we must not only be endued with perfect
   uprightness, but also with very courteous and kind manners, which may
   not only conciliate the just and the good, but produce also a favorable
   impression on the hearts of the ungodly.

   But here two cautions must be stated: We are not to seek to be in such
   esteem as to refuse to undergo the hatred of any for Christ, whenever
   it may be necessary. And indeed we see that there are some who, though
   they render themselves amicable to all by the sweetness of their
   manners and peaceableness of their minds, are yet hated even by their
   nearest connections on account of the gospel. The second caution is, --
   that courteousness should not degenerate into compliance, so as to lead
   us to flatter the vices of men for the sake of preserving peace. Since
   then it cannot always be, that we can have peace with all men, he has
   annexed two particulars by way of exception, If it be possible, and, as
   far as you can. But we are to conclude from what piety and love
   require, that we are not to violate peace, except when constrained by
   either of these two things. For we ought, for the sake of cherishing
   peace, to bear many things, to pardon offenses, and kindly to remit the
   full rigor of the law; and yet in such a way, that we may be prepared,
   whenever necessity requires, to fight courageously: for it is
   impossible that the soldiers of Christ should have perpetual peace with
   the world, whose prince is Satan.

   19. Avenge not yourselves, etc. The evil which he corrects here, as we
   have reminded you, is more grievous than the preceding, which he has
   just stated; and yet both of them arise from the same fountain, even
   from an inordinate love of self and innate pride, which makes us very
   indulgent to our own faults and inexorable to those of others. As then
   this disease begets almost in all men a furious passion for revenge,
   whenever they are in the least degree touched, he commands here, that
   however grievously we may be injured, we are not to seek revenge, but
   to commit it to the Lord. And inasmuch as they do not easily admit the
   bridle, who are once seized with this wild passion, he lays, as it
   were, his hand upon us to restrain us, by kindly addressing us as
   beloved

   The precept; then is, -- that we are not to revenge nor seek to revenge
   injuries done to us. The manner is added, a place is to be given to
   wrath. To give place to wrath, is to commit to the Lord the right of
   judging, which they take away from him who attempt revenge. Hence, as
   it is not lawful to usurp the office of God, it is not lawful to
   revenge; for we thus anticipate the judgment of God, who will have this
   office reserved for himself. He at the same time intimates, that they
   shall have God as their defender, who patiently wait for his help; but
   that those who anticipate him leave no place for the help of God. [397]

   But he prohibits here, not only that we are not to execute revenge with
   our own hands, but that our hearts also are not to be influenced by a
   desire of this kind: it is therefore superfluous to make a distinction
   here between public and private revenge; for he who, with a malevolent
   mind and desirous of revenge, seeks the help of a magistrate, has no
   more excuse than when he devises means for self-revenge. Nay, revenge,
   as we shall presently see, is not indeed at all times to be sought from
   God: for if our petitions arise from a private feeling, and not from
   pure zeal produced by the Spirit, we do not make God so much our judge
   as the executioner of our depraved passion.

   Hence, we do not otherwise give place to wrath, than when with quiet
   minds we wait for the seasonable time of deliverance, praying at the
   same time, that they who are now our adversaries, may by repentance
   become our friends.

   For it is written, etc. He brings proof, taken from the song of Moses,
   Deuteronomy 32:35, where the Lord declares that he will be the avenger
   of his enemies; and God's enemies are all who without cause oppress his
   servants. "He who touches you," he says, "touches the pupil of mine
   eye." With this consolation then we ought to be content, -- that they
   shall not escape unpunished who undeservedly oppress us, -- and that
   we, by enduring, shall not make ourselves more subject or open to the
   injuries of the wicked, but, on the contrary, shall give place to the
   Lord, who is our only judge and deliverer, to bring us help.

   Though it be not indeed lawful for us to pray to God for vengeance on
   our enemies, but to pray for their conversion, that they may become
   friends; yet if they proceed in their impiety, what is to happen to the
   despisers of God will happen to them. But Paul quoted not this
   testimony to show that it is right for us to be as it were on fire as
   soon as we are injured, and according to the impulse of our flesh, to
   ask in our prayers that God may become the avenger of our injuries; but
   he first teaches us that it belongs not to us to revenge, except we
   would assume to ourselves the office of God; and secondly, he
   intimates, that we are not to fear that the wicked will more furiously
   rage when they see us bearing patiently; for God does not in vain take
   upon himself the office of executing vengeance.

   [396] "Providentes bona;" pronooumenoi kala; "procurantes honesta --
   providing honest things," Beza; "providing things reputable,"
   Doddridge; "premeditating things comely," Macknight. The participle
   means to mind beforehand, to prepare, to provide, and also to take care
   of or to attend to a thing. "Attending to things honorable" may be the
   rendering here. The adjective kalos, means fair, good; and good in
   conduct as here is not "comely," but just, right, or reputable, as
   Doddridge renders it. The word "honest" does not now retain its
   original idea of honorable. -- Ed.

   [397] Many have been the advocates of this exposition, Chrysostom,
   Theophylact, Luther, Beza, Hammond, Macknight, Stuart, etc. But there
   is no instance of the expression, "to give place," having this meaning.
   In the two places where it occurs, it means to give way, to yield. See
   Luke 14:9; Ephesians 4:27. Then to give place to wrath, is to yield to
   and patiently to endure the wrath of the man who does the wrong. Some
   have maintained that the meaning is, that the injured man is to give
   place to his own wrath, that is, allow it time to cool: but this view
   comports not with the passage. The subject is, that a Christian is not
   to retaliate, or to return wrath for wrath, but to endure the wrath of
   his enemy, and to leave the matter in the hand of God. With this sense
   the quotation accords as much as with that given by Calvin. Not a few
   have taken this view, Basil, Ambrose, Drusius, Mede, Doddridge, Scott,
   etc. -- Ed.

   Romans 12:20-21

   20. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him
   drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

   20. Itaque si esurit inimicus tuus, pasce illum; si sitit, potum da
   illi: hoc enim faciens carbones ignis congeres in caput ipsius.

   21. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

   21. Ne vincaris a malo, sed vincas bono malum.

   20. If therefore, etc. He now shows how we may really fulfill the
   precepts of not revenging and of not repaying evil, even when we not
   only abstain from doing injury but when we also do good to those who
   have done wrong to us; for it is a kind of an indirect retaliation when
   we turn aside our kindness from those by whom we have been injured.
   Understand as included under the words meat and drink, all acts of
   kindness. Whatsoever then may be thine ability, in whatever business
   thy enemy may want either thy wealth, or thy counsel, or thy efforts,
   thou oughtest to help him. But he calls him our enemy, not whom we
   regard with hatred, but him who entertains enmity towards us. And if
   they are to be helped according to the flesh, much less is their
   salvation to be opposed by imprecating vengeance on them.

   Thou shalt heap coals of fire, etc. As we are not willing to lose our
   toil and labor, he shows what fruit will follow, when we treat our
   enemies with acts of kindness. But some by coals understand the
   destruction which returns on the head of our enemy, when we show
   kindness to one unworthy, and deal with him otherwise than he deserves;
   for in this manner his guilt is doubled. Others prefer to take this
   view, that when he sees himself so kindly treated, his mind is allured
   to love us in return. I take a simpler view, that his mind shall be
   turned to one side or another; for doubtless our enemy shall either be
   softened by our benefits, or if he be so savage that nothing can tame
   him, he shall yet be burnt and tormented by the testimony of his own
   conscience, on finding himself overwhelmed with our kindness. [398]

   21. Be not overcome by evil, etc. This sentence is laid down as a
   confirmation; for in this case our contest is altogether with
   perverseness, if we try to retaliate it, we confess that we are
   overcome by it; if, on the contrary, we return good for evil, by that
   very deed we show the invincible firmness of our mind. This is truly a
   most glorious kind of victory, the fruit of which is not only
   apprehended by the mind, but really perceived, while the Lord is giving
   success to their patience, than which they can wish nothing better. On
   the other hand, he who attempts to overcome evil with evil, may perhaps
   surpass his enemy in doing injury, but it is to his own ruin; for by
   acting thus he carries on war for the devil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [398] Calvin has in this exposition followed Chrysostom and Theodoret.
   The former part no doubt contains the right view; the following verse
   proves it, "Overcome evil with good." The idea of "heaping coals of
   fire" is said to have been derived from the practice of heaping coals
   on the fire to melt hard metals; but as "the coals of fire" must mean
   "burning coals," as indeed the word in Proverbs 25:22, whence the
   passage is taken, clearly means, this notion cannot be entertained. It
   seems to be a sort of proverbial saying, signifying something
   intolerable, which cannot be borne without producing strong effects:
   such is represented to be kindness to any enemy, to feed him when
   hungry and to give him drink when thirsty, has commonly such a power
   over him that he cannot resist its influence, no more than he can
   withstand the scorching heat of burning coals. Of course the natural
   tendency of such a conduct is all that is intended, and not that it
   invariably produces such an effect; for in Scripture things are often
   stated in this way; but human nature is such a strange thing, that it
   often resists what is right, just, and reasonable, and reverses, as it
   were, the very nature of things. It is not true what Whitby and others
   have held, that "coals of fire" always mean judgments or punishments.
   The word indeed in certain connections, as in Psalm 18:13; Psalm
   140:10, has this meaning, but in Proverbs 25:22, it cannot be taken in
   this sense, as the preceding verse most clearly proves. There is no
   canon of interpretation more erroneous than to make words or phrases to
   bear the same meaning in every place. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 13
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 13:1-2

   1. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
   power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

   1. Omnis anima potestatibus supereminentibus subdita sit: non enim est
   potestas, nisi a Deo; quae vero sunt potestates a Deo sunt ordinatae.

   2. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of
   God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

   2. Itaque qui resistit potestati, Dei ordinationi resistit; qui vero
   restiterint judicium sibi accersent.

   1. Let every soul, [399] etc. Inasmuch as he so carefully handles this
   subject in connection with what forms the Christian life, it appears
   that he was constrained to do so by some great necessity which existed
   especially in that age, though the preaching of the gospel at all times
   renders this necessary. There are indeed always some tumultuous spirits
   who believe that the kingdom of Christ cannot be sufficiently elevated,
   unless all earthly powers be abolished, and that they cannot enjoy the
   liberty given by him, except they shake off every yoke of human
   subjection. This error, however, possessed the minds of the Jews above
   all others; for it seemed to them disgraceful that the offspring of
   Abraham, whose kingdom flourished before the Redeemer's coming, should
   now, after his appearance, continue in submission to another power.
   There was also another thing which alienated the Jews no less than the
   Gentiles from their rulers, because they all not only hated piety, but
   also persecuted religion with the most hostile feelings. Hence it
   seemed unreasonable to acknowledge them for legitimate princes and
   rulers, who were attempting to take away the kingdom from Christ, the
   only Lord of heaven and earth.

   By these reasons, as it is probable, Paul was induced to establish,
   with greater care than usual, the authority of magistrates, and first
   he lays down a general precept, which briefly includes what he
   afterwards says: secondly, he subjoins an exposition and a proof of his
   precept.

   He calls them the higher powers, [400] not the supreme, who possess the
   chief authority, but such as excel other men. Magistrates are then thus
   called with regard to their subjects, and not as compared with each
   other. And it seems indeed to me, that the Apostle intended by this
   word to take away the frivolous curiosity of men, who are wont often to
   inquire by what right they who rule have obtained their authority; but
   it ought to be enough for us, that they do rule; for they have not
   ascended by their own power into this high station, but have been
   placed there by the Lord's hand. And by mentioning every soul, he
   removes every exception, lest any one should claim an immunity from the
   common duty of obedience. [401]

   For there is no power, etc. The reason why we ought to be subject to
   magistrates is, because they are constituted by God's ordination. For
   since it pleases God thus to govern the world, he who attempts to
   invert the order of God, and thus to resist God himself, despises his
   power; since to despise the providence of him who is the founder of
   civil power, is to carry on war with him. Understand further, that
   powers are from God, not as pestilence, and famine, and wars, and other
   visitations for sin, are said to be from him; but because he has
   appointed them for the legitimate and just government of the world. For
   though tyrannies and unjust exercise of power, as they are full of
   disorder, (ataxias) are not an ordained government; yet the right of
   government is ordained by God for the wellbeing of mankind. As it is
   lawful to repel wars and to seek remedies for other evils, hence the
   Apostle commands us willingly and cheerfully to respect and honor the
   right and authority of magistrates, as useful to men: for the
   punishment which God inflicts on men for their sins, we cannot properly
   call ordinations, but they are the means which he designedly appoints
   for the preservation of legitimate order.

   2. And they who resist, etc. As no one can resist God but to his own
   ruin, he threatens, that they shall not be unpunished who in this
   respect oppose the providence of God. Let us then beware, lest we incur
   this denunciation. And by judgment, [402] I understand not only the
   punishment which is inflicted by the magistrate, as though he had only
   said, that they would be justly punished who resisted authority; but
   also the vengeance of God, however it may at length be executed: for he
   teaches us in general what end awaits those who contend with God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [399] "Anima," psuche, not only the Hebrews, (see Genesis 14:21;
   46:27,) but the Greeks also designate man by this word. Man is
   sometimes designated by his immaterial part, soul, and sometimes by his
   material part, flesh, or body, as in Romans 12:1. One author says that
   the word soul is used here in order to show that the obedience enforced
   should be from the soul, not feigned, but sincere and genuine. Let
   every soul, that is "every one," says Grotius, "even apostles,
   prophets, and bishops." -- Ed.

   [400] "Potestates supereminentes -- pre-eminent powers." Hammond
   renders the words exousiais huperechousais, supreme powers, meaning
   kings, and refers to archontes in Romans 13:3, as a proof; but this
   word means magistrates as well as kings. See Luke 12:58. The ruling
   power as exercised by those in authority is evidently what is meant
   here, without any reference to any form of government. Of course
   obedience to kings, or to emperors, or to any exercising a ruling
   power, whatever name they may bear, is included. -- Ed

   [401] Grotius qualifies this obedience by saying, that it should not
   extend to what is contrary to the will of God. But it is remarkable,
   that often in Scripture things are stated broadly and without any
   qualifying terms, and yet they have limits, as it is clear from other
   portions. This peculiarity is worthy of notice. Power is from God, the
   abuse of power is from what is evil in men. The Apostle throughout
   refers only to power justly exercised. He does not enter into the
   subject of tyranny and oppression. And this is probably the reason why
   he does not set limits to the obedience required: he contemplated no
   other than the proper and legitimate use of power. -- Ed.

   [402] "Judicium," krima; some render it "punishment;" Beza,
   "condemnation." The word is used in both senses: but according to the
   tenor of the former part of the verse, it seems that the Apostle means
   that which is inflicted by God. -- Ed.

   Romans 13:3-4

   3. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
   thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou
   shalt have praise of the same:

   3. Principes enim non sunt terrori bonis operibus sed malis; vis ergo
   non timere potestatem? bene fac, et habebis laudem ab ea;

   4. For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that
   which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he
   is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth
   evil.

   4. Dei enim minister est tibi in bonum; si vero quid mali feceris,
   time; non enim frustra gladium gerit; Dei enim minister est, vindex in
   iram adversus eos qui male agunt. [403]

   3. For princes, etc. He now commends to us obedience to princes on the
   ground of utility; for the causative gar, for, is to be referred to the
   first proposition, and not to the last verse. Now, the utility is this,
   -- that the Lord has designed in this way to provide for the
   tranquillity of the good, and to restrain the waywardness of the
   wicked; by which two things the safety of mankind is secured: for
   except the fury of the wicked be resisted, and the innocent be
   protected from their violence, all things would come to an entire
   confusion. Since then this is the only remedy by which mankind can be
   preserved from destruction, it ought to be carefully observed by us,
   unless we wish to avow ourselves as the public enemies of the human
   race.

   And he adds, Wilt not thou then fear the power? Do good. By this he
   intimates, that there is no reason why we should dislike the
   magistrate, if indeed we are good; nay, that it is an implied proof of
   an evil conscience, and of one that is devising some mischief, when any
   one wishes to shake off or to remove from himself this yoke. But he
   speaks here of the true, and, as it were, of the native duty of the
   magistrate, from which however they who hold power often degenerate;
   yet the obedience due to princes ought to be rendered to them. For
   since a wicked prince is the Lord's scourge to punish the sins of the
   people, let us remember, that it happens through our fault that this
   excellent blessing of God is turned into a curse.

   Let us then continue to honor the good appointment of God, which may be
   easily done, provided we impute to ourselves whatever evil may
   accompany it. Hence he teaches us here the end for which magistrates
   are instituted by the Lord; the happy effects of which would always
   appear, were not so noble and salutary an institution marred through
   our fault. At the same time, princes do never so far abuse their power,
   by harassing the good and innocent, that they do not retain in their
   tyranny some kind of just government: there can then be no tyranny
   which does not in some respects assist in consolidating the society of
   men.

   He has here noticed two things, which even philosophers have considered
   as making a part of a well-ordered administration of a commonwealth,
   that is, rewards for the good, and punishment for the wicked. The word
   praise has here, after the Hebrew manner, a wide meaning.

   4. For he is God's minister for good, etc. Magistrates may hence learn
   what their vocation is, for they are not to rule for their own
   interest, but for the public good; nor are they endued with unbridled
   power, but what is restricted to the wellbeing of their subjects; in
   short, they are responsible to God and to men in the exercise of their
   power. For as they are deputed by God and do his business, they must
   give an account to him: and then the ministration which God has
   committed to them has a regard to the subjects, they are therefore
   debtors also to them. And private men are reminded, that it is through
   the divine goodness that they are defended by the sword of princes
   against injuries done by the wicked.

   For they bear not the sword in vain, etc. It is another part of the
   office of magistrates, that they ought forcibly to repress the
   waywardness of evil men, who do not willingly suffer themselves to be
   governed by laws, and to inflict such punishment on their offenses as
   God's judgment requires; for he expressly declares, that they are armed
   with the sword, not for an empty show, but that they may smite
   evil-doers.

   And then he says, An avenger, to execute wrath, [404] etc. This is the
   same as if it had been said, that he is an executioner of God's wrath;
   and this he shows himself to be by having the sword, which the Lord has
   delivered into his hand. This is a remarkable passage for the purpose
   of proving the right of the sword; for if the Lord, by arming the
   magistrate, has also committed to him the use of the sword, whenever he
   visits the guilty with death, by executing God's vengeance, he obeys
   his commands. Contend then do they with God who think it unlawful to
   shed the blood of wicked men.

   [403] The words, "Vindex in iram adversus eos qui male agunt," can
   hardly be translated; and the latter part is improperly put in the
   plural. -- Ed.

   [404] Vindex in iram, ekdikos eis orgen; "a revenger to execute wrath,"
   Com. Ver., Doddridge; "a revenger for wrath," Hammond. Wrath is here
   taken to mean punishment, by Luther, Beza, Grotius, Mede, etc. see
   Romans 2:5; Romans 3:5; Romans 4:15. The phrase then might be rendered,
   "condemning to punishment the doer of evil." There is a contrast
   between "for wrath" and "for good" at the beginning of the verse. --
   Ed.

   Romans 13:5-7

   5. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for
   conscience sake.

   5. Itaque necesse est subjici, non modo propter iram, sed etiam propter
   conscientiam.

   6. For, for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
   ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

   6. Propterea enim tributa quoque solutis; ministri [405] enim Dei sunt,
   in hoc incumbentes.

   7. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due;
   custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

   7. Reddite ergo omnibus quod debetur; cui tributum, tributum; cui
   vectigal, vectigal; cui timorem, timorem; cui honorem, honorem.

   5. It is therefore necessary, etc. What he had at first commanded as to
   the rendering of obedience to magistrates, he now briefly repeats, but
   with some addition, and that is, -- that we ought to obey them, not
   only on the ground of necessity arising from man, but that we thereby
   obey God; for by wrath he means the punishment which the magistrates
   inflict for the contempt of their dignity; as though he had said, "We
   must not only obey, because we cannot with impunity resist the powerful
   and those armed with authority, as injuries are wont to be borne with
   which cannot be repelled; but we ought to obey willingly, as conscience
   through God's word thus binds us." Though then the magistrate were
   disarmed, so that we could with impunity provoke and despise him, yet
   such a thing ought to be no more attempted than if we were to see
   punishment suspended over us; for it belongs not to a private
   individual to take away authority from him whom the Lord has in power
   set over us. This whole discourse is concerning civil government; it is
   therefore to no purpose that they who would exercise dominion over
   consciences do hence attempt to establish their sacrilegious tyranny.

   6. For this reason also, etc. He takes occasion to introduce the
   subject of tributes, the reason for which he deduces from the office of
   magistrates; for if it be their duty to defend and safely preserve the
   peace of the good, and to resist the mischievous attempts of the
   wicked, this they cannot do unless they are aided by sufficient force.
   Tributes then are justly paid to support such necessary expenses. [406]
   But respecting the proportion of taxes or tributes, this is not the
   place to discuss the subject; nor does it belong to us either to
   prescribe to princes how much they ought to expend in every affair, or
   to call them to an account. It yet behooves them to remember, that
   whatever they receive from the people, is as it were public property,
   and not to be spent in the gratification of private indulgence. For we
   see the use for which Paul appoints these tributes which are to be paid
   -- even that kings may be furnished with means to defend their
   subjects.

   7. Render then to all what is due, etc. The Apostle seems here
   summarily to include the particulars in which the duties of subjects
   towards magistrates consist, -- that they are to hold them in esteem
   and honor, that they are to obey their edicts, laws, and judgments, --
   that they are to pay tributes and customs. By the word fear, he means
   obedience; by customs and tributes, not only imposts and taxes, but
   also other revenues. [407]

   Now this passage confirms what I have already said, -- that we ought to
   obey kings and governors, whoever they may be, not because we are
   constrained, but because it is a service acceptable to God; for he will
   have them not only to be feared, but also honored by a voluntary
   respect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [405] "Ministri," leitourgoi, administrators, functionaries, the
   performers of public service, or public ministers, according to
   Macknight. Rulers were called before, in Romans 13:4, diakonoi,
   servants, deacons, ministers. The same titles are given to them as to
   the Apostles and ministers of the gospel, and even to Christ himself:
   and they are said to be the ministers and functionaries of God, being
   so in civil matters, as those are in spiritual things who preach the
   gospel. -- Ed.

   [406] The words "to this very thing," eis auto touto, seem to be an
   instance of Hebraism, as z't, "this," in that language is both singular
   and plural, and means "this," or "those," according to the context. "To
   these very things," before mentioned as to the works and duties of
   magistrates, appears to be the meaning here: and so the words are
   rendered in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions. A singular instance is
   found at the beginning of Romans 13:9, "For this," to gar, and then
   several commandments are mentioned; "for this" is the law, says Stuart;
   but the word for "law" is of a different gender. What we would say in
   English is, "for these," etc. It is a Hebrew idiom transferred into
   Greek. -- Ed.

   [407] The distinction commonly made between the two words is this, --
   phoros, "tribute," is a tax on the person or on lands, and telos,
   "custom," is what is levied on merchandise. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 13:8-10

   8. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
   another hath fulfilled the law.

   8. Nemini quicquam debeatis, nisi ut invicem diligatis; qui enim
   diligit alterum Legem implevit.

   9. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou
   shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not
   covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly
   comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself.

   9. Illud enim, Non moechaberis, Non occides, Non falsum testimonium
   dices, Non concupisces, et si quod est aliud praeceptum, in hoc sermone
   comprehenditur, Diliges proximum sicut teipsum.

   10. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
   fulfilling of the law.

   10. Dilectio proximo malum non infert: plenitudo ergo legis est
   dilectio.

   8. To no one owe ye, etc. There are those who think that this was not
   said without a taunt, as though Paul was answering the objection of
   those who contended that Christians were burdened in having other
   precepts than that of love enjoined them. And indeed I do not deny, but
   that it may be taken ironically, as though he conceded to those who
   allowed no other law but that of love, what they required, but in
   another sense. And yet I prefer to take the words simply as they are;
   for I think that Paul meant to refer the precept respecting the power
   of magistrates to the law of love, lest it should seem to any one too
   feeble; as though he had said, -- "When I require you to obey princes,
   I require nothing more than what all the faithful ought to do, as
   demanded by the law of love: for if ye wish well to the good, (and not
   to wish this is inhuman,) ye ought to strive, that the laws and
   judgments may prevail, that the administrators of the laws may have an
   obedient people, so that through them peace may be secured to all." He
   then who introduces anarchy, violates love; for what immediately
   follows anarchy, is the confusion of all things. [408]

   For he who loves another, etc. Paul's design is to reduce all the
   precepts of the law to love, so that we may know that we then rightly
   obey the commandments, when we observe the law of love, and when we
   refuse to undergo no burden in order to keep it. He thus fully confirms
   what he has commanded respecting obedience to magistrates, in which
   consists no small portion of love.

   But some are here impeded, and they cannot well extricate themselves
   from this difficulty, -- that Paul teaches us that the law is fulfilled
   when we love our neighbor, for no mention is here made of what is due
   to God, which ought not by any means to have been omitted. But Paul
   refers not to the whole law, but speaks only of what the law requires
   from us as to our neighbor. And it is doubtless true, that the whole
   law is fulfilled when we love our neighbors; for true love towards man
   does not flow except from the love of God, and it is its evidence, and
   as it were its effects. But Paul records here only the precepts of the
   second table, and of these only he speaks, as though he had said, --
   "He who loves his neighbor as himself, performs his duty towards the
   whole world." Puerile then is the gloss of the Sophists, who attempt to
   elicit from this passage what may favor justification by works: for
   Paul declares not what men do or do not, but he speaks hypothetically
   of that which you will find nowhere accomplished. And when we say, that
   men are not justified by works, we deny not that the keeping of the law
   is true righteousness: but as no one performs it, and never has
   performed it, we say, that all are excluded from it, and that hence the
   only refuge is in the grace of Christ.

   9. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, etc. It cannot be from
   this passage concluded what precepts are contained in the second table,
   for he subjoins at the end, and if there be any other precept He indeed
   omits the command respecting the honoring of parents; and it may seem
   strange, that what especially belonged to his subject should have been
   passed by. But what if he had left it out, lest he should obscure his
   argument? Though I dare not to affirm this, yet I see here nothing
   wanting to answer the purpose he had in view, which was to show, --
   that since God intended nothing else by all his commandments than to
   teach us the duty of love, we ought by all means to strive to perform
   it. And yet the uncontentious reader will readily acknowledge, that
   Paul intended to prove, by things of a like nature, that the import of
   the whole law is, that love towards one another ought to be exercised
   by us, and that what he left to be implied is to be understood, and
   that is, -- that obedience to magistrates is not the least thing which
   tends to nourish peace, to preserve brotherly love.

   10. Love doeth no evil to a neighbor, etc. He demonstrates by the
   effect, that under the word love are contained those things which are
   taught us in all the commandments; for he who is endued with true love
   will never entertain the thought of injuring others. What else does the
   whole law forbid, but that we do no harm to our neighbor? This,
   however, ought to be applied to the present subject; for since
   magistrates are the guardians of peace and justice, he who desires that
   his own right should be secured to every one, and that all may live
   free from wrong, ought to defend, as far as he can, the power of
   magistrates. But the enemies of government show a disposition to do
   harm. And when he repeats that the fulfilling of the law is love,
   understand this, as before, of that part of the law which refers to
   mankind; for the first table of the law, which contains what we owe to
   God, is not here referred to at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [408] The debt of love is to be always paid, and is always due: for
   love is ever to be exercised. We are to pay other debts, and we may pay
   them fully and finally: but the debt of love ever continues, and is to
   be daily discharged. -- Ed.

   Romans 13:11-14

   11. And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out
   of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

   11. Hoc enim, quum noverimus tempus, quia hora est qua jam e somno
   expergiscamur (nunc enim propior est salus nostra quam quum
   credidimus,)

   12. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast
   off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

   12. Nox progressa est, dies vero appropinquavit: abjiciamus ergo opera
   tenebrarum, et induamus arma lucis.

   13. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
   drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
   envying.

   13 Sicut in die decenter ambulemus; non comessationibus neque
   ebrietatibus, neque eubilibus neque lasciviis, neque contentione neque
   aemulatione:

   14. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the
   flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof

   14. Sed induamini Dominum Iesum Christum, et carnis curam ne agatis ad
   concupiscentias.

   11. Moreover, etc. He enters now on another subject of exhortation,
   that as the rays of celestial life had begun to shine on us as it were
   at the dawn, we ought to do what they are wont to do who are in public
   life and in the sight of men, who take diligent care lest they should
   commit anything that is base or unbecoming; for if they do anything
   amiss, they see that they are exposed to the view of many witnesses.
   But we, who always stand in the sight of God and of angels, and whom
   Christ, the true sun of righteousness, invites to his presence, we
   indeed ought to be much more careful to beware of every kind of
   pollution.

   The import then of the words is this, "Since we know that the
   seasonable time has already come, in which we should awake from sleep,
   let us cast aside whatever belongs to the night, let us shake off all
   the works of darkness, since the darkness itself has been dissipated,
   and let us attend to the works of light, and walk as it becomes those
   who are enjoying the day." The intervening words are to be read as in a
   parenthesis.

   As, however, the words are metaphorical, it may be useful to consider
   their meaning: Ignorance of God is what he calls night; for all who are
   thus ignorant go astray and sleep as people do in the night. The
   unbelieving do indeed labor under these two evils, they are blind and
   they are insensible; but this insensibility he shortly after designated
   by sleep, which is, as one says, an image of death. By light he means
   the revelation of divine truth, by which Christ the sun of
   righteousness arises on us. [409] He mentions awake, by which he
   intimates that we are to be equipped and prepared to undertake the
   services which the Lord requires from us. The works of darkness are
   shameful and wicked works; for night, as some one says, is shameless.
   The armor of light represents good, and temperate, and holy actions,
   such as are suitable to the day; and armor is mentioned rather than
   works, because we are to carry on a warfare for the Lord.

   But the particles at the beginning, And this, are to be read by
   themselves, for they are connected with what is gone before; as we say
   in Latin Adhoec -- besides, or proeterea -- moreover. The time, he
   says, was known to the faithful, for the calling of God and the day of
   visitation required a new life and new morals, and he immediately adds
   an explanation, and says, that it was the hour to awake: for it is not
   chronos but kairos which means a fit occasion or a seasonable time.
   [410]

   For nearer is now our salvation, etc. This passage is in various ways
   perverted by interpreters. Many refer the word believed to the time of
   the law, as though Paul had said, that the Jews believed before Christ
   came; which view I reject as unnatural and strained; and surely to
   confine a general truth to a small part of the Church, would have been
   wholly inconsistent. Of that whole assembly to which he wrote, how few
   were Jews? Then this declaration could not have been suitable to the
   Romans. Besides, the comparison between the night and the day does in
   my judgment dissipate every doubt on the point. The declaration then
   seems to me to be of the most simple kind, -- "Nearer is salvation now
   to us than at that time when we began to believe:" so that a reference
   is made to the time which had preceded as to their faith. For as the
   adverb here used is in its import indefinite, this meaning is much the
   most suitable, as it is evident from what follows.

   12. The night has advanced, and the day, etc. This is the season which
   he had just mentioned; for as the faithful are not as yet received into
   full light, he very fitly compares to the dawn the knowledge of future
   life, which shines on us through the gospel: for day is not put here,
   as in other places, for the light of faith, (otherwise he could not
   have said that it was only approaching, but that it was present, for it
   now shines as it were in the middle of its progress,) but for that
   glorious brightness of the celestial life, the beginnings of which are
   now seen through the gospel.

   The sum of what he says is, -- that as soon as God begins to call us,
   we ought to do the same, as when we conclude from the first dawn of the
   day that the full sun is at hand; we ought to look forward to the
   coming of Christ.

   He says that the night had advanced, because we are not so overwhelmed
   with thick darkness as the unbelieving are, to whom no spark of life
   appears; but the hope of resurrection is placed by the gospel before
   our eyes; yea, the light of faith, by which we discover that the full
   brightness of celestial glory is nigh at hand, ought to stimulate us,
   so that we may not grow torpid on the earth. But afterwards, when he
   bids us to walk in the light, as it were during the day time, he does
   not continue the same metaphor; for he compares to the day our present
   state, while Christ shines on us. His purpose was in various ways to
   exhort us, -- at one time to meditate on our future life; at another,
   to contemplate the present favor of God.

   13. Not in reveling, etc. He mentions here three kinds of vices, and to
   each he has given two names, -- intemperant and excess in living, --
   carnal lust and uncleanness, which is connected with it, -- and envy
   and contention. If these have in them so much filthiness, that even
   carnal men are ashamed to commit them before the eyes of men, it
   behooves us, who are in the light of God, at all times to abstain from
   them; yea, even when we are withdrawn from the presence of men. As to
   the third vice, though contention is put before envying, there is yet.
   no doubt but that Paul intended to remind us, that strifes and contests
   arise from this fountain; for when any one seeks to excel, there is
   envying of one another; but ambition is the source of both evils. [411]

   14. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, etc. This metaphor is commonly
   used in Scripture with respect to what tends to adorn or to deform man;
   both of which may be seen in his clothing: for a filthy and torn
   garment dishonors a man; but what is becoming and clean recommends him.
   Now to put on Christ, means here to be on every side fortified by the
   power of his Spirit, and be thereby prepared to discharge all the
   duties of holiness; for thus is the image of God renewed in us, which
   is the only true ornament of the soul. For Paul had in view the end of
   our calling; inasmuch as God, by adopting us, unites us to the body of
   his only-begotten Son, and for this purpose, -- that we, renouncing our
   former life, may become new men in him. [412] On this account he says
   also in another place, that we put on Christ in baptism. (Galatians
   3:27.)

   And have no care, etc. As long as we carry about us our flesh, we
   cannot cast away every care for it; for though our conversation is in
   heaven, we yet sojourn on earth. The things then which belong to the
   body must be taken care of, but not otherwise than as they are helps to
   us in our pilgrimage, and not that they may make us to forget our
   country. Even heathens have said, that a few things suffice nature, but
   that the appetites of men are insatiable. Every one then who wishes to
   satisfy the desires of the flesh, must necessarily not only fall into,
   but be immerged in a vast and deep gulf.

   Paul, setting a bridle on our desires, reminds us, that the cause of
   all intemperance is, that no one is content with a moderate or lawful
   use of things: he has therefore laid down this rule, -- that we are to
   provide for the wants of our flesh, but not to indulge its lusts. It is
   in this way that we shall use this world without abusing it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [409] The preceding explanation of night and day, as here to be
   understood, does not comport with what is afterwards said on Romans
   13:12. The distinction between night and day of a Christian, ought to
   be clearly kept in view. The first is what is here described, but the
   latter is what the passage refers to. And the sleep mentioned here is
   not the sleep of ignorance and unbelief, but the sleep, the torpor, or
   inactivity of Christians. That the present state of believers, their
   condition in this world, is meant here by "night," and their state of
   future glory is meant by "day," appears evident from the words which
   follow, "for nearer now is our salvation than when we believed."
   Salvation here, as in Romans 8:24, and in 1 Peter 1:9, means salvation
   made complete and perfect, the full employment of all its blessings.
   Indeed in no other sense can what is said here of night and day be
   appropriate. The night of heathen ignorance as to Christians had
   already passed, and the day of gospel light was not approaching, but
   had appeared. -- Ed.

   [410] The words kai touto, according to Beza, Grotius, Mede, etc.,
   connect what follows with the preceding exhortation to love, "And this
   do, or let us do, as we know," etc. But the whole tenor of what follows
   by no means favors this view. The subject is wholly different. It is
   evidently a new subject of exhortation, as Calvin says, and the words
   must be rendered as he proposes, or be viewed as elliptical; the word
   "I say," or "I command," according to Macknight, being understood,
   "This also I say, since we know the time," etc. If we adopt "I
   command," or "moreover," as Calvin does, it would be better to regard
   the participle eidotes, as having the meaning of an imperative, este
   being understood, several instances of which we have in the preceding
   chapter, Romans 12:9,16,17. The whole passage would then read better in
   this manner, -- 11. Moreover, know the time, that it is even now the
   very time for us to awake from sleep; for nearer now is our salvation
   than when we 12. believed: the night has advanced, and the day has
   approached; let us then cast away the works of darkness, and let us put
   on the 13. armor of light; let us, as in the day, walk in a becoming
   manner, etc. -- Ed.

   [411] The case is the same with the two preceding instances; the vice
   which seems to follow is placed first. Revelling is first mentioned,
   though drunkenness goes before it; and "chambering," or concubinage, or
   indulgence in unlawful lusts is first stated, though lasciviousness or
   wantonness is the source from which it proceeds. It is an example of
   the Apostle's mode of writing similar to what we find in Romans 11:29,
   as to "the gifts and calling of God," and in verse 33, as to "the
   wisdom and knowledge of God." -- Ed.

   [412] Many have explained "the putting on" here in a manner wholly
   inconsistent with the passage, as though the putting on of Christ's
   righteousness was intended. Calvin keeps to what accords with the
   context, the putting on of Christ as to his holy image. Sanctification,
   and not justification, is the subject of the passage. To put on Christ,
   then, is to put on his virtues and graces, to put on or be endued with
   his spirit, to imitate his conduct and to copy his example. This is in
   addition to the putting him on as our righteousness, and not as a
   substitute for it. Both are necessary: for Christ is our
   sanctification, the author, worker, and example of it, as well as our
   righteousness. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 14
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 14:1-4

   1. Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
   disputations.

   1. Eum vero qui fide est imbecilla, suscipite, non ad disceptationes
   quaestionum.

   2. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak,
   eateth herbs.

   2. Qui credit, vescatur quibusvis: qui autem infirmus est, olera edit.

   3. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him
   which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.

   3. Qui edit, non contemnat eum qui abstinet; et qui abstinet, eum non
   condemnet qui edit: Dominus enim illum suscepit.

   4. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master
   he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to
   make him stand.

   4. Tu quis es qui judicas alienum servum? proprio Domino stat vel
   cadit. Stabit vero: potens est enim Deus efficere ut stet.

   1. Him indeed, etc. He passes on now to lay down a precept especially
   necessary for the instruction of the Church, -- that they who have made
   the most progress in Christian doctrine should accommodate themselves
   to the more ignorant, and employ their own strength to sustain their
   weakness; for among the people of God there are some weaker than
   others, and who, except they are treated with great tenderness and
   kindness, will be discouraged, and become at length alienated from
   religion. And it is very probable that this happened especially at that
   time; for the Churches were formed of both Jews and Gentiles; some of
   whom, having been long accustomed to the rites of the Mosaic law,
   having been brought up in them from childhood, were not easily drawn
   away from them; and there were others who, having never learnt such
   things, refused a yoke to which they had not been accustomed. [413]

   Now, as man's disposition is to slide from a difference in opinion to
   quarrels and contentions, the Apostle shows how they who thus vary in
   their opinions may live together without any discord; and he prescribes
   this as the best mode, -- that they who are strong should spend their
   labor in assisting the weak, and that they who have made the greatest
   advances should bear with the more ignorant. For God, by making us
   stronger than others, does not bestow strength that we may oppress the
   weak; nor is it the part of Christian wisdom to be above measure
   insolent, and to despise others. The import then of what he addresses
   to the more intelligent and the already confirmed, is this, -- that the
   ampler the grace which they had received from the Lord, the more bound
   they were to help their neighbors.

   Not for the debatings of questions. [414] This is a defective sentence,
   as the word which is necessary to complete the sense is wanting. It
   appears, however, evident, that he meant nothing else than that the
   weak should not be wearied with fruitless disputes. But we must
   remember the subject he now handles: for as many of the Jews still
   clave to the shadows of the law, he indeed admits, that this was a
   fault in them; he yet requires that they should be for a time excused;
   for to press the matter urgently on them might have shaken their faith.
   [415]

   He then calls those contentious questions which disturb a mind not yet
   sufficiently established, or which involve it in doubts. It may at the
   same time be proper to extend this farther, even to any thorny and
   difficult questions, by which weak consciences, without any
   edification, may be disquieted and disturbed. We ought then to consider
   what questions any one is able to bear, and to accommodate our teaching
   to the capacity of individuals.

   2. Let him who believes, etc. What Erasmus has followed among the
   various readings I know not; but he has mutilated this sentence, which,
   in Paul's words, is complete; and instead of the relative article he
   has improperly introduced alius -- one, "One indeed believes," etc.
   That I take the infinitive for an imperative, ought not to appear
   unnatural nor strained, for it is a mode of speaking very usual with
   Paul. [416] He then calls those believers who were endued with a
   conscience fully satisfied; to these he allowed the use of all things
   without any difference. In the mean time the weak did eat herbs, and
   abstained from those things, the use of which he thought was not
   lawful. If the common version be more approved, the meaning then will
   be, -- that it is not right that he who freely eats all things, as he
   believes them to be lawful, should require those, who are yet tender
   and weak in faith, to walk by the same rule. But to render the word
   sick, as some have done, is absurd.

   3. Let not him who eats, etc. He wisely and suitably meets the faults
   of both parties. They who were strong had this fault, -- that they
   despised those as superstitious who were scrupulous about insignificant
   things, and also derided them: these, on the other hand, were hardly
   able to refrain from rash judgments, so as not to condemn what they did
   not follow; for whatever they perceived to be contrary to their own
   sentiments, they thought was evil. Hence he exhorts the former to
   refrain from contempt, and the latter from excessive moroseness. And
   the reason which he adds, as it belongs to both parties, ought to be
   applied to the two clauses, -- "When you see," he says, "a man
   illuminated with the knowledge of God, you have evidence enough that he
   is received by the Lord; if you either despise or condemn him, you
   reject him whom God has embraced." [417]

   4. Who art thou who judgest, etc. "As you would act uncourteously, yea,
   and presumptuously among men, were you to bring another man's servant,
   under your own rules, and try all his acts by the rule of your own
   will; so you assume too much, if you condemn anything in God's servant,
   because it does not please you; for it belongs not to you to prescribe
   to him what to do and what not to do, nor is it necessary for him to
   live according to your law."

   Now, though the power of judging as to the person, and also as to the
   deed, is taken from us, there is yet much difference between the two;
   for we ought to leave the man, whatever he may be, to the judgment of
   God; but as to his deeds we may indeed form a decisive opinion, though
   not according to our own views, but according to the word of God; and
   the judgment, derived from his word, is neither human, nor another
   man's judgment. Paul then intended here to restrain us from presumption
   in judging; into which they fall, who dare to pronounce anything
   respecting the actions of men without the warrant of God's word.

   To his own Lord he stands or falls, etc. As though he said, -- "It
   belongs rightly to the Lord, either to disapprove, or to accept what
   his servant doeth: hence he robs the Lord, who attempts to take to
   himself this authority." And he adds, he shall indeed stand: and by so
   saying, he not only bids us to abstain from condemning, but also
   exhorts us to mercy and kindness, so as ever to hope well of him, in
   whom we perceive anything of God; inasmuch as the Lord has given us a
   hope, that he will fully confirm, and lead to perfection, those in whom
   he has begun the work of grace.

   But by referring to the power of God, he means not simply, as though he
   had said, that God can do this if he will; but, after the usual manner
   of Scripture, he connects God's will with his power: and yet he speaks
   not here of perpetuity, as though they must stand to the end whom God
   has once raised up; but he only reminds us, that we are to entertain a
   good hope, and that our judgments should lean this way; as he also
   teaches us in another place,

   "He who began in you a good work, will perform it to the end."
   (Philippians 1:6.)

   In short, Paul shows to what side their judgments incline, in whom love
   abounds.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [413] Some, as Haldane, have found fault with this classification, as
   there is nothing in the chapter which countenances it. But as the
   Apostle's object throughout the epistle was to reconcile the Jews and
   Gentiles, there is reason sufficient to regard them as the two parties
   here intended: and, as Chalmers justly observes, it is more probable
   that the Gentiles were the despisers, inasmuch as the Jews, who, like
   Paul, had got over their prejudices, were no doubt disposed to
   sympathize with their brethren, who were still held fast by them. --
   Ed.

   [414] Non ad disceptationes quaestionum, me eis diakriseis dialogismon;
   "non ad altercationes disceptationum -- not for the altercations of
   disputings" or debatings, Beza; "not to debates about matter in doubt,"
   Doddridge; "not in order to the strifes of disputations," Macknight.
   Both words are in the plural number; therefore to give the first the
   sense of "judging," as Hodge does, cannot be right; for in that case it
   would have been in the singular number. The words may be rendered, "no
   for the solutions of doubts." One of the meanings of the first word,
   according to Hesychius, is dialusis -- untying, loosening, dissolving;
   and for the latter, see Luke 24:38, and 1 Timothy 2:8. according to the
   frequent import of the preposition eis, the sentence may be thus
   paraphrased, "Him who is weak in the faith receive, but not that ye may
   solve his doubts," or, "debate in reasonings," or, "contend in
   disputations." -- Ed.

   [415] Scott's remarks on this verse are striking and appropriate, --
   "Notwithstanding," he says, "the authority vested by Christ in his
   Apostles, and their infallibility in delivering his doctrine to
   mankind, differences of opinion prevailed even among real Christians;
   nor did St. Paul, by an express decision and command, attempt to put a
   final termination to them. A proposition indeed may be certain and
   important truth; yet a man cannot receive it without due preparation of
   mind and heart; -- so that a compelled assent to any doctrine, or
   conformity to any outward observances, without conviction, would in
   general be hypocrisy, and entirely unavailing. So essential are the
   rights and existence of private judgment, in all possible cases, to the
   exercise of true religion! and so useless an encumbrance would an
   infallible judge be, for deciding controversies, and producing
   unanimity among Christians!"

   [416] This is true, but the passage here seems not to require such a
   construction. Both sentences are declarative, announcing a fact
   respecting two parties: the one believed he might eat everything; the
   other did eat only herbs. The relative hos, when repeated, often means
   "one," as in Romans 13:5, and in 1 Corinthians 11:21: and the article
   ho stands here for that repetition; an example of which Raphelius
   adduces from the Greek classics. Some think that this abstinence from
   meat was not peculiar to the Jews; but that some Gentiles also had
   scruples on the subject. It is true that heathens, who held the
   transmigration of souls, did not eat flesh: but it is not likely that
   abstinence, arising from such an absurd notion, would have been thus
   treated by the Apostle. It indeed appears evident, that the abstinence
   here referred to did arise from what was regarded to be the will of
   God: and though abstinence from all animal food was not enjoined on the
   Jews, yet it appears from history that Jews, living among heathens,
   wholly abstained, owing to the fear they had of being in any way
   contaminated. This was the case with Daniel and his companions, Daniel
   1:8-16. Professor Hodge says, in a note on this passage, "Josephus
   states in his life (chapter 23) that certain Jewish priests, while at
   Rome, lived entirely upon fruit, from the dread of eating anything
   unclean." We may also suppose that some of the Essenes, who abstained
   from meat and from wine, were among the early converts. -- Ed.

   [417] The last clause is by Haldane confined to the strong, and he
   objects to this extension of it; and certainly the following verse is
   in favor of his view, for the weak, the condemner, is the person
   reproved, and therefore the strong is he who to his own master stands
   or falls. The condemner throughout is the weak, and the despised is the
   strong. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 14:5-6

   5. One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day
   alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

   5. Hic quidem diem prae die aestimat; ille autem peraque aestimat omnem
   diem. Unusquisque sententiae suae certus sit.

   6. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that
   regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that
   eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that
   eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

   6. Qui curat diem, Domino curat; qui non curat diem, Domino non curat.
   Qui vescitur, Domino vescitur, gratias enim agit Deo; et qui abstinet,
   Domino abstinet, et gratias agit Deo.

   5. One indeed, etc. He had spoken before of scruples in the choice of
   meats; he now adds another example of difference, that is, as to days;
   and both these arose from Judaism. For as the Lord in his law made a
   difference between meats and pronounced some to be unclean, the use of
   which he prohibited, and as he had also appointed festal and solemn
   days and commanded them to be observed, the Jews, who had been brought
   up from their childhood in the doctrine of the law, would not lay aside
   that reverence for days which they had entertained from the beginning,
   and to which through life they had been accustomed; nor could they have
   dared to touch these meats from which they had so long abstained. That
   they were imbued with these notions, was an evidence of their weakness;
   they would have thought otherwise, had they possessed a certain and a
   clear knowledge of Christian liberty. But in abstaining from what they
   thought to be unlawful, they evidenced piety, as it would have been a
   proof of presumption and contempt, had they done anything contrary to
   the dictates of conscience.

   Here then the Apostle applies the best rule, when he bids every one to
   be fully assured as to his own mind; by which he intimates that there
   ought to be in Christians such a care for obedience, that they do
   nothing, except what they think, or rather feel assured, is pleasing to
   God. [418] And this ought to be thoroughly borne in mind, that it is
   the first principle of a right conduct, that men should be dependent on
   the will of God, and never allow themselves to move even a finger,
   while the mind is doubtful and vacillating; for it cannot be otherwise,
   but that rashness will soon pass over into obstinacy when we dare to
   proceed further than what we are persuaded is lawful for us. If any
   object and say, that infirmity is ever perplexing, and that hence such
   certainty as Paul requires cannot exist in the weak: to this the plain
   answer is, -- That such are to be pardoned, if they keep themselves
   within their own limits. For Paul's purpose was none other than to
   restrain undue liberty, by which it happens, that many thrust
   themselves, as it were, at random, into matters which are doubtful and
   undetermined. Hence Paul requires this to be adopted, -- that the will
   of God is to preside over all our actions.

   6. He who regards a day, etc. Since Paul well knew that a respect for
   days proceeded from ignorance of Christ, it is not probable that such a
   corruption was altogether defended by him; and yet his words seem to
   imply, that he who regarded days committed no sin; for nothing but good
   can be accepted by God. Hence, that you may understand his purpose, it
   is necessary to distinguish between the notion, which any one may have
   entertained as to the observance of days, and the observance itself to
   which he felt himself bound. The notion was indeed superstitious, nor
   does Paul deny this; for he has already condemned it by calling it
   infirmity, and he will again condemn it still more plainly. Now, that
   he who was held fast by this superstition, dared not to violate the
   solemnity of a particular day; this was approved by God, because he
   dared not to do any thing with a doubtful conscience. What indeed could
   the Jew do, who had not yet made such progress, as to be delivered from
   scruples about days? He had the word of God, in which the keeping of
   days was commended; there was a necessity laid on him by the law; and
   its abrogation was not clearly seen by him. Nothing then remained, but
   that he, waiting for a fuller revelation, should keep himself within
   the limits of his own knowledge, and not to avail himself of the
   benefit of liberty, before he embraced it by faith. [419]

   The same also must be thought of him who refrained from unclean meats:
   for if he ate in a doubtful state of mind, it would not have been to
   receive any benefit, from God's hand, but to lay his own hand on
   forbidden things. Let him then use other things, which he thinks is
   allowed to him, and follow the measure of his knowledge: he will thus
   give thanks to God; which he could not do, except he was persuaded that
   he is fed by God's kindness. He is not then to be despised, as though
   he offended the Lord by this his temperance and pious timidity: and
   there is nothing unreasonable in the matter, if we say, that the
   modesty of the weak is approved by God, not on the ground of merit, but
   through indulgence.

   But as he had before required an assurance of mind, so that no one
   ought rashly of his own will to do this or that, we ought to consider
   whether he is here exhorting rather than affirming; for the text would
   better flow in this strain, -- "Let a reason for what he does be clear
   to every one; as an account must be given before the celestial
   tribunal; for whether one eats meat or abstains, he ought in both
   instances to have regard to God." And doubtless there is nothing more
   fitted to restrain licentiousness in judging and to correct
   superstitions, than to be summoned before the tribunal of God: and
   hence Paul wisely sets the judge before all, to whose will they are to
   refer whatever they do. It is no objection that the sentence is
   affirmative; for he immediately subjoins, that no one lives or dies for
   himself; where he declares, not what men do, but commands what they
   ought to do.

   Observe also what he says, -- that we then eat to the Lord, or abstain,
   when we give thanks. Hence, eating is impure, and abstinence is impure,
   without thanksgiving. It is only the name of God, when invoked, that
   sanctifies us and all we have.

   [418] "Unusquisque sententiae suae certus sit;" hekastos en to idio noi
   plerophoreistho; "unusquisque in animo suo plene certus esto -- let
   every one be fully sure in his own mind," Beza, Pareus; "let every one
   be convinced in his mind," Macknight; "let every one freely enjoy his
   own sentiment," Doddridge This last is by no means the sense: Our own
   version is the best and the most literal, "let every man be fully
   persuaded in his own mind;" and with which Calvin's exposition
   perfectly agrees. For the meaning of the verb here see Romans 4:21.
   "The Greek word is a metaphor borrowed from ships, which are carried
   with full sail, and signifieth a most certain persuasion of the truth."
   -- Leigh. The certain persuasion here refers to both parties -- the
   eater and the abstainer: both were to do what they were fully convinced
   was agreeable to the will of God. -- Ed.

   [419] It has been suggested as a question by some, whether the
   Christian Sabbath is included here? The very subject in hand proves
   that it is not. The subject discussed is the observance of Jewish days,
   as in Galatians 4:10, and Colossians 2:16, and not what belonged to
   Christians in common. -- Ed.

   Romans 14:7-9

   7. For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

   7. Nemo enim nostrum sibi ipsi vivit, et nemo sibi moritur.

   8. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we
   die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the
   Lord's.

   8. Sive enim vivimus, Domino vivimus; sive morimur, Domino morimur:
   sive vivimus sive morimur, Domini sumus.

   9. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, [420] that
   he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

   9. In hoc enim et mortuus est Christus, et resurrexit, et revixit,
   [421] ut vivis dominetur et mortuis.

   7. For no one of us, etc. He now confirms the former verse by an
   argument derived from the whole to a part, -- that it is no matter of
   wonder that particular acts of our life should be referred to the
   Lord's will, since life itself ought to be wholly spent to his glory;
   for then only is the life of a Christian rightly formed, when it has
   for its object the will of God. But if thou oughtest to refer whatever
   thou doest to his good pleasure, it is then an act of impiety to
   undertake anything whatever, which thou thinkest will displease him;
   nay, which thou art not persuaded will please him.

   8. To the Lord we live, etc. This does not mean the same as when it is
   said in Romans 6:11, that we are made alive unto God by his Spirit, but
   that we conform to his will and pleasure, and design all things to his
   glory. Nor are we only to live to the Lord, but also to die; that is,
   our death as well as our life is to be referred to his will. He adds
   the best of reasons, for whether we live or die, we are his: and it
   hence follows, that he has full authority over our life and our death.

   The application of this doctrine opens into a wide field. God thus
   claims authority over life and death, that his own condition might be
   borne by every one as a yoke laid on him; for it is but just that he
   should assign to every one his station and his course of life. And thus
   we are not only forbidden rashly to attempt this or that without God's
   command, but we are also commanded to be patient under all troubles and
   losses. If at any time the flesh draws back in adversities, let it come
   to our minds, that he who is not free nor has authority over himself,
   perverts right and order if he depends not on the will of his lord.
   Thus also is taught us the rule by which we are to live and to die, so
   that if he extends our life in continual sorrows and miseries, we are
   not yet to seek to depart before our time; but if he should suddenly
   call us hence in the flower of our age, we ought ever to be ready for
   our departure.

   9. For to this end Christ also died, etc. This is a confirmation of the
   reason which has been last mentioned; for in order to prove that we
   ought to live and to die to the Lord, he had said, that whether we live
   or die we are under the power of Christ. He now shows how rightly
   Christ claims this power over us, since he has obtained it by so great
   a price; for by undergoing death for our salvation, he has acquired
   authority over us which cannot be destroyed by death, and by rising
   again, he has received our whole life as his peculiar property. He has
   then by his death and resurrection deserved that we should, in death as
   well as in life, advance the glory of his name. The words arose and
   lived again mean, that by resurrection he attained a new state of life;
   and that as the life which he now possesses is subject to no change,
   his dominion over us is to be eternal.

   Romans 14:10-13

   10. But why dost thou judge thy brother? [422] or why dost thou set at
   nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of
   Christ.

   10. Tu vero quid judicas fratrem tuum? aut etiam tu, quid contemnis
   fratrem tuum? Omnes enim sistemur ad tribunal Christi:

   11. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow
   to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

   11. Scripture est enim, Vivo ego, dick Dominus, mihi flectetur omne
   genu, et omnis lingua confitebitur Deo.

   12. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

   12. Unusquisque igitur de se rationem redder Deo.

   13. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this
   rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
   brother's way.

   13. Quare ne amplius judicemus alius alium: sed hoc judicate potius, ne
   lapsus occasio detur fratri aut offendiculum.

   10. But thou, why dost thou, etc. As he had made the life and death of
   us all subject to Christ, he now proceeds to mention the authority to
   judge, which the Father has conferred on him, together with the
   dominion over heaven and earth. He hence concludes, that it is an
   unreasonable boldness in any one to assume the power to judge his
   brother, since by taking such a liberty he robs Christ the Lord of the
   power which he alone has received from the Father.

   But first, by the term brother, he checks this lust for judging; for
   since the Lord has established among us the right of a fraternal
   alliance, an equality ought to be preserved; every one then who assumes
   the character of a judge acts unreasonably. Secondly, he calls us
   before the only true judge, from whom no one can take away his power,
   and whose tribunal none can escape. As then it would be absurd among
   men for a criminal, who ought to occupy a humble place in the court, to
   ascend the tribunal of the judge; so it is absurd for a Christian to
   take to himself the liberty of judging the conscience of his brother. A
   similar argument is mentioned by James, when he says, that "he who
   judges his brother, judges the law," and that "he who judges the law,
   is not an observer of the law but a president;" and, on the other hand,
   he says, that "there is but one lawgiver, who can save and destroy."
   (James 4:12.) He has ascribed tribunal to Christ, which means his power
   to judge, as the voice of the archangel, by which we shall be summoned,
   is called, in another place, a trumpet; for it will pierce, as it were
   with its sound, into the minds and ears of all. [423]

   11. As I live, etc. He seems to me to have quoted this testimony of the
   Prophet, not so much to prove what he had said of the judgment-seat of
   Christ, which was not doubted among Christians, as to show that
   judgment ought to be looked for by all with the greatest humility and
   lowliness of mind; and this is what the words import. He had first then
   testified by his own words, that the power to judge all men is vested
   in Christ alone; he now demonstrates by the words of the Prophet, that
   all flesh ought to be humbled while expecting that judgment; and this
   is expressed by the bending of the knee. But though in this passage of
   the Prophet the Lord in general foreshows that his glory should be
   known among all nations, and that his majesty should everywhere shine
   forth, which was then hid among very few, and as it were in an obscure
   corner of the world; yet if we examine it more closely, it will be
   evident that its complete fulfillment is not now taking place, nor has
   it ever taken place, nor is it to be hoped for in future ages. God does
   not now rule otherwise in the world than by his gospel; nor is his
   majesty otherwise rightly honored but when it is adored as known from
   his word. But the word of God has ever had its enemies, who have been
   perversely resisting it, and its despisers, who have ever treated it
   with ridicule, as though it were absurd and fabulous. Even at this day
   there are many such, and ever will be. It hence appears, that this
   prophecy is indeed begun to be fulfilled in this life, but is far from
   being completed, and will not be so until the day of the last
   resurrection shall shine forth, when Christ's enemies shall be laid
   prostrate, that they may become his footstool. But this cannot be
   except the Lord shall ascend his tribunal: he has therefore suitably
   applied this testimony to the judgment-seat of Christ.

   This is also a remarkable passage for the purpose of confirming our
   faith in the eternal divinity of Christ: for it is God who speaks here,
   and the God who has once for all declared, that he will not give his
   glory to another. (Isaiah 42:8.) Now if what he claims here to himself
   alone is accomplished in Christ, then doubtless he in Christ manifests
   himself. And unquestionably the truth of this prophecy then openly
   appeared, when Christ gathered a people to himself from the whole
   world, and restored them to the worship of his majesty and to the
   obedience of his gospel. To this purpose are the words of Paul, when he
   says that God gave a name to his Christ, at which every knee should
   bow, (Philippians 2:10:) and it shall then still more fully appear,
   when he shall ascend his tribunal to judge the living and the dead; for
   all judgment in heaven and on earth has been given to him by the
   Father.

   The words of the Prophet are, "Every tongue shall swear to me:" but as
   an oath is a kind of divine worship, the word which Paul uses, shall
   confess, does not vary in sense: [424] for the Lord intended simply to
   declare, that all men should not only acknowledge his majesty, but also
   make a confession of obedience, both by the mouth and by the external
   gesture of the body, which he has designated by the bowing of the knee.

   12. Every one of us, etc. This conclusion invites us to humility and
   lowliness of mind: and hence he immediately draws this inference, --
   that we are not to judge one another; for it is not lawful for us to
   usurp the office of judging, who must ourselves submit to be judged and
   to give an account.

   From the various significations of the word to judge, he has aptly
   drawn two different meanings. In the first place he forbids us to
   judge, that is, to condemn; in the second place he bids us to judge,
   that is, to exercise judgment, so as not to give offense. He indeed
   indirectly reproves those malignant censors, who employ all their
   acuteness in finding out something faulty in the life of their
   brethren: he therefore bids them to exercise wariness themselves; for
   by their neglect they often precipitate, or drive their brethren
   against some stumblingblock or another. [425]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [422] It appears from the order of the words su de ti, and he kai su
   ti, that the address was made to two parties. "But thou, the weak, why
   condemnest thou thy brother? and thou also, the strong, why dost thou
   despise thy brother?" -- Ed.

   [423] The words "We shall all stand," etc., may be rendered, "We must
   all stand," etc. It is indeed the future tense, but this is according
   to what is often the case in Hebrew, for in that language the future
   has frequently this meaning. Romans 13:12 may be rendered in the same
   manner, "So then every one of us must give account of himself to God."
   -- Ed.

   [424] The passage is from Isaiah 45:23. In two instances the Apostle
   gives the sense, and not the words. Instead of "by myself have I
   sworn," he gives the form of the oath, "As I live." This is the manner
   in which God swears by himself, it is by his life -- his eternal
   existence. Then the conclusion of the verse in Hebrew is, "every tongue
   shall swear," that is, "unto me." To swear to God or by his name is to
   avow allegiance to him, to profess or to confess his name. See Psalm
   63:11; Isaiah 63:1; Zephaniah 1:5. The Apostle therefore does no more
   than interpret the Hebrew idiom when he says, "every tongue shall
   confess to God." -- Ed.

   [425] The two words, proskomma and skandalon, mean nearly the same
   thing, but with this difference, that the first seems to be an
   hindrance or an obstacle which occasions stumbling or falling, and the
   other is an obstacle which stops or impedes progress in the way. See
   Matthew 16:23. The two parties, the strong and the weak, are here
   evidently addressed; the former was not, by eating, to put a
   stumblingblock in the way of the weak brother; nor was the weak, by
   condemning, to be a hindrance or impediment in the way of the strong so
   as to prevent him to advance in his course. Thus we see that
   forbearance is enjoined on both parties, though the Apostle afterwards
   dwells more on what the strong was to do. The clause might be thus
   rendered, -- "But rather judge it right to do this, --
   not to lay before a brother a stumbling-stone, or an impediment." --
   Ed.

   Romans 14:14-18

   14. I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, [426] that there is
   nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be
   unclean, to him it is unclean.

   14. Novi et persuasus sum in Domino Iesu, nihil commune per se esse;
   nisi qui existimat aliquid esse commune, ei commune est.

   15. But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not
   charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

   15. Verum si propter cibum frater tuus contristatur, jam non secundum
   charitatem ambulas; ne cibo tuo ilium perdas, pro quo Christus mortuus
   est.

   16. Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

   16. Ne vestrum igitur bonum hominum maledicentiae sit obnoxium:

   17. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness,
   and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

   17. Non enim est regnum Dei esca et potus; sed justitia, et pax, et
   gaudium in Spiritu sancto.

   18. For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God,
   and approved of men.

   18. Qui enim servit per haec Christo, acceptus est Deo, et probatus
   hominibus.

   14. I know, etc. To anticipate their objection, who made such progress
   in the gospel of Christ as to make no distinction between meats, he
   first shows what must be thought of meats when viewed in themselves;
   and then he subjoins how sin is committed in the use of them. He then
   declares, that no meat is impure to a right and pure conscience, and
   that there is no hindrance to a pure use of meats, except ignorance and
   infirmity; for when any imagines an impurity in them, he is not at
   liberty to use them. But he afterwards adds, that we are not only to
   regard meats themselves, but also the brethren before whom we eat: for
   we ought not to view the use of God's bounty with so much indifference
   as to disregard love. His words then have the same meaning as though he
   had said, -- "I know that all meats are clean, and therefore I leave to
   thee the free use of them; I allow thy conscience to be freed from all
   scruples: in short, I do not simply restrain thee from meats; but
   laying aside all regard for them, I still wish thee not to neglect thy
   neighbor."

   By the word common, in this place, he means unclean, and what is taken
   indiscriminately by the ungodly; and it is opposed to those things
   which had been especially set apart for the use of the faithful people.
   He says that he knew, and was fully convinced, that all meats are pure,
   in order to remove all doubts. He adds, in the Lord Jesus; for by his
   favor and grace it is, that all the creatures which were accursed in
   Adam, are blessed to us by the Lord. [427] He intended, however, at the
   same time, to set the liberty given by Christ in opposition to the
   bondage of the law, lest they thought that they were bound to observe
   those rites from which Christ had made them free. By the exception
   which he has laid down, we learn that there is nothing so pure but what
   may be contaminated by a corrupt conscience: for it is faith alone and
   godliness which sanctify all things to us. The unbelieving, being
   polluted within, defile all things by their very touch. (Titus 1:15.)

   15. But if through meat thy brother is grieved, etc. He now explains
   how the offending of our brethren may vitiate the use of good things.
   And the first thing is, -- that love is violated, when our brother is
   made to grieve by what is so trifling; for it is contrary to love to
   occasion grief to any one. The next thing is, -- that when the weak
   conscience is wounded, the price of Christ's blood is wasted; for the
   most abject brother has been redeemed by the blood of Christ: it is
   then a heinous crime to destroy him by gratifying the stomach; and we
   must be basely given up to our own lusts, if we prefer meat, a
   worthless thing, to Christ. [428] The third reason is, -- that since
   the liberty attained for us by Christ is a blessing, we ought to take
   care, lest it should be evil spoken of by men and justly blamed, which
   is the case, when we unseasonably use God's gifts. These reasons then
   ought to influence us, lest by using our liberty, we thoughtlessly
   cause offenses. [429]

   17. For the kingdom of God, etc. He now, on the other hand, teaches us,
   that we can without loss abstain from the use of our liberty, because
   the kingdom of God does not consist in such things. Those things
   indeed, which are necessary either to build up or preserve the kingdom
   of God, are by no means to be neglected, whatever offenses may hence
   follow: but if for love's sake it be lawful to abstain from meat, while
   God's honor is uninjured, while Christ's kingdom suffers no harm, while
   religion is not hindered, then they are not to be borne with, who for
   meat's sake disturb the Church. He uses similar arguments in his first
   Epistle to the Corinthians:

   "Meat," he says, "for the stomach, and the stomach for meat; but God
   will destroy both," (1 Corinthians 6:13:)

   again,

   "If we eat, we shall not abound," (1 Corinthians 8:8.)

   By these words he meant briefly to show, that meat and drink were
   things too worthless, that on their account the course of the gospel
   should be impeded.

   But righteousness and peace, etc. He, in passing, has set these in
   opposition to meat and drink; not for the purpose of enumerating all
   the things which constitute the kingdom of Christ, but of showing, that
   it consists of spiritual things. He has at the same time no doubt
   included in few words a summary of what it is; namely, that we, being
   well assured, have peace with God, and possess real joy of heart
   through the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. But as I have said, these few
   things he has accommodated to his present subject. He indeed who is
   become partaker of true righteousness, enjoys a great and an invaluable
   good, even a calm joy of conscience; and he who has peace with God,
   what can he desire more? [430]

   By connecting peace and joy together, he seems to me to express the
   character of this joy; for however torpid the reprobate may be, or
   however they may elevate themselves, yet the conscience is not rendered
   calm and joyful, except when it feels God to be pacified and propitious
   to it; and there is no solid joy but what proceeds from this peace. And
   though it was necessary, when mention was made of these things, that
   the Spirit should have been declared as the author; yet he meant in
   this place indirectly to oppose the Spirit to external things, that we
   might know, that the things which belong to the kingdom of God continue
   complete to us without the use of meats.

   18. For he who in these things, etc. An argument drawn from the effect:
   for it is impossible, but that when any one is acceptable to God and
   approved by men, the kingdom of God fully prevails and flourishes in
   him: he, who with a quiet and peaceful conscience serves Christ in
   righteousness, renders himself approved by men as well as by God.
   Wherever then there is righteousness and peace and spiritual joy, there
   the kingdom of God is complete in all its parts: it does not then
   consist of material things. But he says, that man is acceptable to God,
   because he obeys his will; he testifies that he is approved by men,
   because they cannot do otherwise than bear testimony to that excellency
   which they see with their eyes: not that the ungodly always favor the
   children of God; nay, when there is no cause, they often pour forth
   against them many reproaches, and with forged calumnies defame the
   innocent, and in a word, turn into vices things rightly done, by
   putting on them a malignant construction. But Paul speaks here of
   honest judgment, blended with no moroseness, no hatred, no
   superstition.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [426] "At the very time of giving forth the sentence, and on the
   highest of all authority, that there was nothing unclean of itself, he
   yet leaves others at liberty to esteem anything unclean. We are not
   sure if anywhere else in Scripture, the divine authority of toleration
   is so clearly manifested." -- Chalmers

   [427] To elicit this meaning, which is in itself true, Calvin must have
   construed the sentence thus, "I know, and I am persuaded, that through
   the Lord Jesus nothing is of itself unclean:" but this is not the
   meaning. What the Apostle says is, that he knew, and was fully assured
   by the Lord Jesus, that is, by the teaching of his word Spirit, that
   nothing was in itself unclean, all ceremonial distinctions having been
   now removed and abolished. -- Ed.

   [428] From the words "destroy not," etc., some have deduced the
   sentiment, that those for whom Christ died may perish for ever. It is
   neither wise nor just to draw a conclusion of this kind; for it is one
   that is negatived by many positive declarations of Scripture. Man's
   inference, when contrary to God's word, cannot be right. Besides, the
   Apostle's object in this passage is clearly this, -- to exhibit the sin
   of those who disregarded without saying that it actually effected that
   evil. Some have very unwisely attempted to obviate the inference above
   mentioned, by suggesting, that the destruction meant was that of
   comfort and edification. But no doubt the Apostle meant the ruin of the
   soul; hence the urgency of his exhortation, -- "Do not act in such a
   way as tends to endanger the safety of a soul for whom Christ has shed
   his blood;" or, "Destroy not," that is, as far as you can do so.
   Apostles and ministers are said to "save" men; some are exhorted here
   not to "destroy" them. Neither of these effects can follow, except in
   the first instance, God grants his blessing, and in the second his
   permission; and his permission as to his people he will never grant, as
   he has expressly told us. See John 10:27-29. -- Ed.

   [429] "Vestrum bonum," humon to agathon. Some, such as Grotius and
   Hammond, Scott, Chalmers, etc., agree with Calvin, and view this
   "good," or privilege, to be Christian liberty, or freedom from
   ceremonial observances, (see 1 Corinthians 10:29;) but Origen, Ambrose,
   Theodoret, Mede, etc., consider that the gospel is meant. The first
   opinion is the most suitable to the passage. -- Ed.

   [430] What is here said is no doubt true of the kingdom of God; but by
   considering what is afterwards said in the two following verses, we
   cannot well accede to this exposition. Righteousness, peace, and joy,
   mentioned here, are things acceptable to God and approved by men: they
   must then be things apparent and visible, which men see and observe;
   and to follow "the things of peace," refers to the conduct.
   "Righteousness" then must mean here the doing of what is right and just
   towards one another; "peace," concord and unanimity, as opposed to
   discord and contentions; "joy," the fruit of this peaceable state, a
   cheering delight, a mutual rejoicing, instead of the sorrow and grief
   occasioned by discord; and these come "through the Holy Spirit" and are
   produced by him; and they are not the semblances of such virtues and
   graces, presented in some instances by false religions. See Galatians
   5:22,23. Doddridge, Stuart, and Chalmers have viewed the passage in
   this light, though the latter, as well as Scott, seemed inclined to
   combine the two views: but this is to mix up things together
   unnecessarily, and to destroy the harmony of the context. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 14:19-21

   19. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and
   things wherewith one may edify another.

   19. Proinde quae pacis sunt, et aedificationis mutuae, sectemur.

   20. For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure;
   but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

   20. Ne propter cibum destruas opus Dei. Omnia quidem pura, sed malum
   est homini qui per offensionem vescitur.

   21. It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing
   whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

   21. Bonum est non edere carnem, nec vinum bibere, [431] nec aliud
   facere in quo frater tuus concidat, vel offendatur, vel infirmetur.

   19. Let us then follow, etc. He recalls us, as much as possible, from a
   mere regard to meats, to consider those greater things which ought to
   have the first place in all our actions, and so to have the precedence.
   We must indeed eat, that we may live; we ought to live, that we may
   serve the Lord; and he serves the Lord, who by benevolence and kindness
   edifies his neighbor; for in order to promote these two things, concord
   and edification, all the duties of love ought to be exercised. Lest
   this should be thought of little moment, he repeats the sentence he had
   before announced, -- that corruptible meat is not of such consequence
   that for its sake the Lord's building should be destroyed. For wherever
   there is even a spark of godliness, there the work of God is to be
   seen; which they demolish, who by their unfeeling conduct disturb the
   conscience of the weak.

   But it must be noticed, that edification is joined to peace; because
   some, not unfrequently, too freely indulge one another, so that they do
   much harm by their compliances. Hence in endeavoring to serve one
   another, discretion ought to be exercised, and utility regarded, so
   that we may willingly grant to our brother whatever may be useful to
   further his salvation. So Paul reminds us in another place: "All
   things," he says, "are lawful to me; but all things are not expedient;"
   and immediately he adds the reason, "Because all things do not edify."
   (1 Corinthians 10:23.)

   Nor is it also in vain that he repeats again, For meat destroy not,
   [432] etc., intimating, that he required no abstinence, by which there
   would be, according to what he had said before, any loss to piety:
   though we eat not anything we please, but abstain from the use of meats
   for the sake of our brethren; yet the kingdom of God continues entire
   and complete.

   20. All things are indeed pure, etc. By saying, that all things are
   pure, he makes a general declaration; and by adding, that it is evil
   for man to eat with offense, he makes an exception; as though he had
   said, -- "Meat is indeed good, but to give offense is bad." Now meat
   has been given to us, that we may eat it, provided love be observed: he
   then pollutes the use of pure meat, who by it violates love. Hence he
   concludes, that it is good to abstain from all things which tend to
   give offense to our brethren.

   He mentions three things in order, to fall, to stumble, to be weakened:
   the meaning seems to be this, -- "Let no cause of falling, no, nor of
   stumbling, no, nor of weakening, be given to the brethren." For to be
   weakened is less than to stumble, and to stumble is less than to fall.
   He may be said to be weakened whose conscience wavers with doubt, -- to
   stumble when the conscience is disturbed by some greater perplexity,
   and to fall when the individual is in a manner alienated from his
   attention to religion. [433]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [431] Jerome often employed the former part of this verse for the
   purpose of encouraging nomasticism; and by thus disconnecting it from
   the context, he got a passage quite suitable to his purpose. Even
   Erasmus condemned this shameful perversion. -- Ed.

   [432] This is a similar, but not the same sentence as in Romans 14:15.
   The verb is different, katalue; which means to undo, to loosen, to pull
   down; and as "work" follows, which, as Calvin and others think, is to
   be understood of God's building, the work of edifying or building up
   his people, the verb may in this sense be rendered here, "Pull not down
   the work of God." But here, as in Romans 14:15, it is the tendency of
   the deed that is to be considered, and the effect as far as man's doing
   was concerned. The Apostle says nothing of what God would do. -- Ed.

   [433] What is said here proves what is stated in [6]a note on Romans
   14:13; that is, that skandalon is a less evil than proskomma, only that
   the idea of stumbling, instead of hindrance or impediment, is given
   here to the former word. The Apostle still adopts, as it were, the
   ascending scale. He first mentions the most obvious effect, the actual
   fall, the extreme evil, and then the next to it, the obstacle in the
   way; and, in the third place, the weakening of the faith of the
   individual. The real order of the process is the reverse, -- the
   weakening, then the impediment, and, lastly, the stumblingblock which
   occasions the fall. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 14:22-23

   22. Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that
   condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

   22. Tu fidem habes? apud teipsum habe coram Deo. Beatus qui non judicat
   seipsum in eo quod examinat.

   23. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of
   faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

   23. Qui vero dijudicat si comederit condemnatus est; quia non ex fide:
   quicquid vero non est ex fide, peccatum est.

   22. Hast thou faith? In order to conclude, he shows in what consists
   the advantage of Christian liberty: it hence appears, that they boast
   falsely of liberty who know not how to make a right use of it. He then
   says, that liberty really understood, as it is that of faith, has
   properly a regard to God; so that he who is endued with a conviction of
   this kind, ought to be satisfied with peace of conscience before God;
   nor is it needful for him to show before men that he possesses it. It
   hence follows, that if we offend our weak brethren by eating meats, it
   is through a perverse opinion; for there is no necessity to constrain
   us.

   It is also plainly evident how strangely perverted is this passage by
   some, who hence conclude, that it is not material how devoted any one
   may be to the observance of foolish and superstitious ceremonies,
   provided the conscience remains pure before God. Paul indeed intended
   nothing less, as the context clearly shows; for ceremonies are
   appointed for the worship of God, and they are also a part of our
   confession: they then who tear off faith from confession, take away
   from the sun its own heat. But Paul handles nothing of this kind in
   this place, but only speaks of our liberty in the use of meat and
   drink.

   Happy is he who condemns not himself, etc. Here he means to teach us,
   first, how we may lawfully use the gifts of God; and, secondly, how
   great an impediment ignorance is; and he thus teaches us, lest we
   should urge the uninstructed beyond the limits of their infirmity. But
   he lays down a general truth, which extends to all actions, -- "Happy,"
   he says, "is he who is not conscious of doing wrong, when he rightly
   examines his own deeds." For it happens, that many commit the worst of
   crimes without any scruple of conscience; but this happens, because
   they rashly abandon themselves, with closed eyes, to any course to
   which the blind and violent intemperance of the flesh may lead them;
   for there is much difference between insensibility and a right
   judgment. He then who examines things is happy, provided he is not
   bitten by an accusing conscience, after having honestly considered and
   weighed matters; for this assurance alone can render our works pleasing
   to God. Thus is removed that vain excuse which many allege on the
   ground of ignorance; inasmuch as their error is connected with
   insensibility and sloth: for if what they call good intention is
   sufficient, their examination, according to which the Spirit of God
   estimates the deeds of men, is superfluous. [434]

   23. But he who is undecided, etc. He very fitly expresses in one word
   the character of that mind which vacillates and is uncertain as to what
   ought to be done; for he who is undecided undergoes alternate changes,
   and in the midst of his various deliberations is held suspended by
   uncertainty. As then the main thing in a good work is the persuasion of
   a mind conscious of being right before God, and as it were a calm
   assurance, nothing is more opposed to the acceptance of our works than
   vacillation. [435] And, oh! that this truth were fixed in the minds of
   men, that nothing ought to be attempted except what the mind feels
   assured is acceptable to God, men would not then make such an uproar,
   as they often do now, nor waver, nor blindly hurry onward wherever
   their own imagination may lead them. For if our way of living is to be
   confined to this moderation, that no one is to touch a morsel of meat
   with a doubting conscience, how much greater caution is to be exercised
   in the greatest things?

   And whatever is not from faith, etc. The reason for this condemnation
   is, that every work, however splendid and excellent in appearance, is
   counted as sin, except it be founded on a right conscience; for God
   regards not the outward display, but the inward obedience of the heart,
   by this alone is an estimate made of our works. Besides, how can that
   be obedience, when any one undertakes what he is not persuaded is
   approved by God? Where then such a doubt exists, the individual is
   justly charged with prevarication; for he proceeds in opposition to the
   testimony of his own conscience.

   The word faith is to be taken here for a fixed persuasion of the mind,
   or, so to speak, for a firm assurance, and not that of any kind, but
   what is derived from the truth of God. Hence doubt or uncertainty
   vitiates all our actions, however specious they may otherwise be. Now,
   since a pious mind can never acquiesce with certainty in anything but
   the word of God, all fictitious modes of worship do in this case vanish
   away, and whatever works there may be which originate in the brains of
   men; for while everything which is not from faith is condemned,
   rejected is whatever is not supported and approved by God's word. It is
   at the same time by no means sufficient that what we do is approved by
   the word of God, except the mind, relying on this persuasion, prepares
   itself cheerfully to do its work. Hence the first thing in a right
   conduct, in order that our minds may at no time fluctuate, is this,
   that we, depending on God's word, confidently proceed wherever it may
   call us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [434] The version of Calvin is, "Beatus qui non judicat seipsum in eo
   quod examinat," makarios ho me krinon heauton en o dokimazei; the
   latter part is rendered by Beza, and Piscator, "in eo quod approbat --
   in that which he approves;" by Doddridge, "in the thing which he
   alloweth;" by Macknight, "by what he approveth." The reference is no
   doubt to the strong, who had "faith," who believed all meats lawful.
   The verb means to try, to examine, as well as to approve; but the
   latter seems to be its meaning here. To approve and to have faith
   appears in this case to be the same: then to have faith and not to
   abuse it by giving offense to a brother was to be a happy man, who did
   not condemn himself. The meaning then most suitable to the passage is
   this, "Happy the man! who condemns not himself by what he approves,"
   that is, by eating meat to the annoyance and stumbling of the weak. --
   Ed.

   [435] The Greek is ho diakrinomenos, "he who discerns," that is, a
   difference as to meats; so Doddridge, Macknight, and Chalmers regard
   its meaning. Beza has "qui dubitat -- who doubts," and so our version.
   The word used by Calvin is dijudicat, which properly means to judge
   between things, to discern, but according to his explanation it means
   to judge in two ways, to be undecided. The verb no doubt admits of
   these two meanings; it is used evidently in the sense of making or
   putting a difference, but only, as some say, in the active voice. There
   are indeed two places where it seems to have this meaning in its
   passive or middle form, James 2:4, and Jude 1:22. But as Paul has
   before used it in this Epistle, Romans 4:20, in the sense of
   hesitating, staggering, or doubting, we may reasonably suppose that it
   has this meaning here, and especially as in every place where he
   expresses the other idea, he has employed the active form. See 1
   Corinthians 4:7; 1 Corinthians 11:29,31; etc. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 15 [436]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 15:1-3

   1. We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,
   and not to please ourselves.

   1. Debemus autem nos qui potentes sumus, infirmitates impotentium
   portare, et non placere nobis ipsis:

   2. Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
   edification.

   2. Unusquisque enim nostrum proximo placeat in bonum, ad
   aedificationem.

   3. For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The
   reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

   3. Etenim Christus non placuit sibi ipsi; sed quemadmodum scriptum est,
   Opprobria exprobrantium tibi, ceciderunt super me.

   1. We then who are strong, etc. Lest they who had made more advances
   than others in the knowledge of God should think it unreasonable, that
   more burden was to be laid on them than on others, he shows for what
   purpose this strength, by which they excelled others, was bestowed on
   them, even that they might so sustain the weak as to prevent them to
   fall. For as God has destined those to whom he has granted superior
   knowledge to convey instruction to the ignorant, so to those whom he
   makes strong he commits the duty of supporting the weak by their
   strength; thus ought all gifts to be communicated among all the members
   of Christ. The stronger then any one is in Christ, the more bound he is
   to bear with the weak. [437]

   By saying that a Christian ought not to please himself, he intimates,
   that he ought not to be bent on satisfying himself, as they are wont to
   be, who are content with their own judgment, and heedlessly neglect
   others: and this is indeed an admonition most suitable on the present
   subject; for nothing impedes and checks acts of kindness more than when
   any one is too much swallowed up with himself, so that he has no care
   for others, and follows only his own counsels and feelings.

   2. Let indeed [438] every one of us, etc. He teaches us here, that we
   are under obligations to others, and that it is therefore our duty to
   please and to serve them, and that there is no exception in which we
   ought not to accommodate ourselves to our brethren when we can do so,
   according to God's word, to their edification.

   There are here two things laid down, -- that we are not to be content
   with our own judgment, nor acquiesce in our own desires, but ought to
   strive and labor at all times to please our brethren, -- and then, that
   in endeavoring to accommodate ourselves to our brethren, we ought to
   have regard to God, so that our object may be their edification; for
   the greater part cannot be pleased except you indulge their humor; so
   that if you wish to be in favor with most men, their salvation must not
   be so much regarded, but their folly must be flattered; nor must you
   look to what is expedient, but to what they seek to their own ruin. You
   must not then strive to please those to whom nothing is pleasing but
   evil.

   3. For even Christ pleased not himself, etc. Since it is not right that
   a servant should refuse what his lord has himself undertaken, it would
   be very strange in us to wish an exemption from the duty of bearing the
   infirmities of others, to which Christ, in whom we glory as our Lord
   and King, submitted himself; for he having no regard for himself, gave
   up himself wholly to this service. For in him was really verified what
   the Prophet declares in Psalm 69:9,10: and among other things he
   mentions this, that "zeal for God's house had eaten him up," and that
   "the reproaches of those who reproached God fell on him." By these
   words it is intimated, that he burned with so much fervor for God's
   glory that he was possessed by such a desire to promote his kingdom,
   that he forgot himself, and was, as it were, absorbed with this one
   thought, and that he so devoted himself to the Lord that he was grieved
   in his soul whenever he perceived his holy name exposed to the
   slandering of the ungodly. [439]

   The second part, "the reproaches of God," may indeed be understood in
   two ways, -- either that he was not less affected by the contumelies
   which were heaped on God, than if he himself had endured them, -- or,
   that he grieved not otherwise to see the wrong done to God, than if he
   himself had been the cause. But if Christ reigns in us, as he must
   necessarily reign in his people, this feeling is also vigorous in our
   hearts, so that whatever derogates from the glory of God does not
   otherwise grieve us than if it was done to ourselves. Away then with
   those whose highest wish is to gain honors from them who treat God's
   name with all kinds of reproaches, tread Christ under foot,
   contumeliously rend, and with the sword and the flame persecute his
   gospel. It is not indeed safe to be so much honored by those by whom
   Christ is not only despised but also reproachfully treated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [437] The word for "strong" is dunatoi, "able," which Calvin renders
   potentes, powerful, or able. They were the more advanced in knowledge
   and in piety. They were to "bear," bastazein, in the sense of carrying
   or sustaining the infirmities of the weak, impotentium, "the unable,"
   adunaton, such as were unable to carry their own burdens. The duty is
   not merely to bear with or tolerate weaknesses, (for this is not the
   meaning of the verb,) but to help and assist the weak and the feeble to
   carry them. The most literal rendering is -- "We then who are able
   ought to bear (or carry)
   the infirmities of the unable." -- Ed.

   [438] The gar in this verse is considered by Griesbach as wholly
   spurious; and Beza has left it out. -- Ed.

   [439] The intention of producing Christ's example here is to enjoin
   disinterestedness. He denies himself for the sake of glorifying God in
   the salvation of men: so his followers ought to show the same spirit;
   they ought to inconvenience themselves, and undergo toil, trouble,
   suffering, and reproaches, if necessary, in order to help and assist
   their fellow-Christians. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 15:4-6

   4. For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
   learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
   have hope.

   4. Quaecunque enim ante scripta sunt, in nostram doctrinam sunt
   scripta, ut per patientain et consolationem Scripturarum spem habeamus.

   5. Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded
   one toward another, according to Christ Jesus:

   5. Deus autem patientiae et consolationis det vobis idem mutuo cogitare
   secundum Christum Iesum;

   6. That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   6. Ut uno animo, uno ore, glorificetis Deum et Patrem Domini nostri
   Iesu Christi.

   4. For whatsoever things, etc. This is an application of the example,
   lest any one should think, that to exhort us to imitate Christ was
   foreign to his purpose; "Nay," he says, "there is nothing in Scripture
   which is not useful for your instruction, and for the direction of your
   life." [440]

   This is an interesting passage, by which we understand that there is
   nothing vain and unprofitable contained in the oracles of God; and we
   are at the same time taught that it is by the reading of the Scripture
   that we make progress in piety and holiness of life. Whatever then is
   delivered in Scripture we ought to strive to learn; for it were a
   reproach offered to the Holy Spirit to think, that he has taught
   anything which it does not concern us to know; let us also know, that
   whatever is taught us conduces to the advancement of religion. And
   though he speaks of the Old Testament, the same thing is also true of
   the writings of the Apostles; for since the Spirit of Christ is
   everywhere like itself, there is no doubt but that he has adapted his
   teaching by the Apostles, as formerly by the Prophets, to the
   edification of his people. Moreover, we find here a most striking
   condemnation of those fanatics who vaunt that the Old Testament is
   abolished, and that it belongs not in any degree to Christians; for
   with what front can they turn away Christians from those things which,
   as Paul testifies, have been appointed by God for their salvation?

   But when he adds, that through the patience and the consolation of the
   Scriptures we might have hope, [441] he does not include the whole of
   that benefit which is to be derived from God's word; but he briefly
   points out the main end; for the Scriptures are especially serviceable
   for this purpose -- to raise up those who are prepared by patience, and
   strengthened by consolations, to the hope of eternal life, and to keep
   them in the contemplation of it. [442] The word consolation some render
   exhortation; and of this I do not disapprove, only that consolation is
   more suitable to patience, for this arises from it; because then only
   we are prepared to bear adversities with patience, when God blends them
   with consolation. The patience of the faithful is not indeed that
   hardihood which philosophers recommend, but that meekness, by which we
   willingly submit to God, while a taste of his goodness and paternal
   love renders all things sweet to us: this nourishes and sustains hope
   in us, so that it fails not.

   5. And the God of patience, etc. God is so called from what he
   produces; the same thing has been before very fitly ascribed to the
   Scriptures, but in a different sense: God alone is doubtless the author
   of patience and of consolation; for he conveys both to our hearts by
   his Spirit: yet he employs his word as the instrument; for he first
   teaches us what is true consolation, and what is true patience; and
   then he instills and plants this doctrine in our hearts.

   But after having admonished and exhorted the Romans as to what they
   were to do, he turns to pray for them: for he fully understood, that to
   speak of duty was to no purpose, except God inwardly effected by his
   Spirit what he spoke by the mouth of man. The sum of his prayer is, --
   that he would bring their minds to real unanimity, and make them united
   among themselves: he also shows at the same time what is the bond of
   unity, for he wished them to agree together according to Christ Jesus.
   Miserable indeed is the union which is unconnected with God, and that
   is unconnected with him, which alienates us from his truth. [443]

   And that he might recommend to us an agreement in Christ, he teaches us
   how necessary it is: for God is not truly glorified by us, unless the
   hearts of all agree in giving him praise, and their tongues also join
   in harmony. There is then no reason for any to boast that he will give
   glory to God after his own manner; for the unity of his servants is so
   much esteemed by God, that he will not have his glory sounded forth
   amidst discords and contentions. This one thought ought to be
   sufficient to check the wanton rage for contention and quarreling,
   which at this day too much possesses the minds of many.

   [440] "The object of this verse is not so much to show the propriety of
   applying the passage quoted from the Psalms to Christ, as to show that
   the facts recorded in the Scriptures are designed for our instruction."
   -- Hodge

   [441] Or, That we might possess, enjoy, or retain hope. He does not
   describe this hope, it being sufficiently evident -- the hope of the
   gospel. -- Ed.

   [442] Some take "patience" apart from "consolation," -- "through
   patience, and the consolation of the Scriptures;" but what is evidently
   meant is the patience and consolation which the Scriptures teach and
   administer, or are the means of supplying; for it is the special object
   of the passage to show the benefits derived from the Scriptures. Then
   it is no doubt "consolation," and not exhortation, though the word has
   also that meaning; for in the next verse it clearly means consolation.
   It is thus rendered, and in connection with "patience," by Beza,
   Pareus, Doddridge, Macknight, etc. In our version it is "comfort" in
   Romans 15:4, and "consolation" in Romans 15:5; but it would have been
   better to have retained the same word. -- Ed.

   [443] There is a difference of opinion as to the unity contemplated
   here, whether it be that of sentiment or of feeling. The phrase, to
   auto phronein, occurs in the following places, Romans 12:16; Romans
   15:5; 2 Corinthians 13:11; Philippians 2:2; Philippians 3:16;
   Philippians 4:2 Leigh says, that the phrase signifies to be of one
   mind, of one judgment, of one affection, towards one another. But
   though the verb phronein may admit of these three significations, yet
   the Apostle no doubt had in view a specific idea; and when we consider
   that he had been inculcating the principle of toleration as to unity of
   sentiment with regard to the eating of meats and of observing of days,
   and that he has been enforcing the duty of forbearance, and of
   sympathy, and of love towards each other, it appears probable that
   unity of feeling and of concern for each other's welfare is what is
   intended here. Beza, Scott, and Chalmers take this view, while Pareus,
   Mede, and Stuart take the other, that is, that unity of sentiment is
   what is meant. What confirms the former, in addition to the general
   import of the context, is the clause which follows, "according to
   Christ Jesus," which evidently means, "according to his example," as
   mentioned in verse 3. Then in the next verse, the word homothumadon
   refers to the unity of feeling and of action, rather than to that of
   sentiment. It occurs, besides here, in these places, Acts 1:14, Acts
   2:1,46; Acts 4:24; Acts 5:12; Acts 7:57; Acts 8:6; Acts 12:20; Acts
   15:25; Acts 18:12; Acts 19:29. It is used by the Septuagint for ychd,
   which means "together." It is rendered "unanimiter -- unanimously,"
   Beza; "with one mind," by Doddridge; and "unanimously," by Macknight.
   It is thus paraphrased by Grotius, "with a mind full of mutual love,
   free from contempt, free from hatred." -- Ed.

   Romans 15:7-12

   7. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the
   glory of God.

   7. Itaque suscipite vos mutuo, quemadmodum Christus vos suscepit, in
   gloriam Dei.

   8. Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for
   the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:

   8. Dico autem Iesum Christum ministerium fuisse circumcisionis super
   veritate Dei ad promissiones Patrum confirmandas:

   9. And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
   written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and
   sing unto thy name.

   9. Gentes autem pro misericordia glorificare debent Deum; quemadmodum
   scriptum est, Propter hoc confitebor tibi inter Gentes et nomini tuo
   psallam:

   10. And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

   10. Et rursum dicit, Exultate Gentes cum populo ejus;

   11. And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye
   people.

   11. Et rursum, Laudate Dominum omnes Gentes, et collaudate eum omnes
   populi.

   12. And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he
   that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles
   trust.

   12. Et rursum Iesaias dicit, Erit radix Jesse, et qui exurget ad
   imperandum Gentibus; in ipso Gentes sperabunt.

   7. Receive ye then, etc. He returns to exhortation; and to strengthen
   this he still retains the example of Christ. For he, having received,
   not one or two of us, but all together, has thus connected us, so that
   we ought to cherish one another, if we would indeed continue in his
   bosom. Only thus then shall we confirm our calling, that is, if we
   separate not ourselves from those whom the Lord has bound together.

   The words, to the glory of God, may be applied to us only, or to
   Christ, or to him and us together: of the last I mostly approve, and
   according to this import, -- "As Christ has made known the glory of the
   Father in receiving us into favor, when we stood in need of mercy; so
   it behooves us, in order to make known also the glory of the same God,
   to establish and confirm this union which we have in Christ." [444]

   8. Now I say, that Jesus Christ, etc. He now shows that Christ has
   embraced us all, so that he leaves no difference between the Jews and
   the Gentiles, except that in the first place he was promised to the
   Jewish nation, and was in a manner peculiarly destined for them, before
   he was revealed to the Gentiles. But he shows, that with respect to
   that which was the seed of all contentions, there was no difference
   between them; for he had gathered them both from a miserable
   dispersion, and brought them, when gathered, into the Father's kingdom,
   that they might be one flock, in one sheepfold, under one shepherd. It
   is hence right, he declares, that they should continue united together,
   and not despise one another; for Christ despised neither of them. [445]

   He then speaks first of the Jews, and says, that Christ was sent to
   them, in order to accomplish the truth of God by performing the
   promises given to the Fathers: and it was no common honor, that Christ,
   the Lord of heaven and earth, put on flesh, that he might procure
   salvation for them; for the more he humbled himself for their sake, the
   greater was the honor he conferred on them. But this point he evidently
   assumes as a thing indubitable. The more strange it is, that there is
   such effrontery in some fanatical heads, that they hesitate not to
   regard the promises of the Old Testament as temporal, and to confine
   them to the present world. And lest the Gentiles should claim any
   excellency above the Jews, Paul expressly declares, that the salvation
   which Christ has brought belonged by covenant to the Jews; for by his
   coming he fulfilled what the Father had formerly promised to Abraham,
   and thus he became the minister of that people. It hence follows that
   the old covenant was in reality spiritual, though it was annexed to
   earthly types; for the fulfillment, of which Paul now speaks, must
   necessarily relate to eternal salvation. And further, lest any one
   should cavil, and say, that so great a salvation was promised to
   posterity, when the covenant was deposited in the hand of Abraham, he
   expressly declares that the promises were made to the Fathers. Either
   then the benefits of Christ must be confined to temporal things, or the
   covenant made with Abraham must be extended beyond the things of this
   world.

   9. The Gentiles also, [446] etc. This is the second point, on proving
   which he dwells longer, because it was not so evident. The first
   testimony he quotes is taken from Psalm 18; which psalm is recorded
   also in 2 Samuel 22, where no doubt a prophecy is mentioned concerning
   the kingdom of Christ; and from it Paul proves the calling of the
   Gentiles, because it is there promised, that a confession to the glory
   of God should be made among the Gentiles; for we cannot really make God
   known, except among those who hear his praises while they are sung by
   us. Hence that God's name may be known among the Gentiles, they must be
   favored with the knowledge of him, and come into communion with his
   people: for you may observe this everywhere in Scripture, that God's
   praises cannot be declared, except in the assembly of the faithful, who
   have ears capable of hearing his praise.

   10 Exult, ye Gentiles, with his people This verse is commonly
   considered as if it was taken from the song of Moses; but with this I
   cannot agree; for Moses' design there was to terrify the adversaries of
   Israel by setting forth his greatness, rather than to invite them to a
   common joy. I hence think that this is quoted from Psalm 47:5, where it
   is written, "Exult and rejoice let the Gentiles, because thou judgest
   the nations in equity, and the Gentiles on the earth thou guidest." And
   Paul adds, with his people, and he did this by way of explanation; for
   the Prophet in that psalm no doubt connects the Gentiles with Israel,
   and invites both alike to rejoice; and there is no joy without the
   knowledge of God. [447]

   11. Praise God, all ye Gentiles, etc. This passage is not inaptly
   applied; for how can they, who know not God's greatness, praise him?
   They could no more do this than to call on his name, when unknown. It
   is then a prophecy most suitable to prove the calling of the Gentiles;
   and this appears still more evident from the reason which is there
   added; for he bids them to give thanks for God's truth and mercy.
   (Psalm 117:1.)

   12. And again, Isaiah, etc., This prophecy is the most illustrious of
   them all: for in that passage, the Prophet, when things were almost
   past hope, comforted the small remnant of the faithful, even by this,
   -- that there would arise a shoot from the dry and the dying trunk of
   David's family, and that a branch would flourish from his despised
   root, which would restore to God's people their pristine glory. It is
   clear from the account there given, that this shoot was Christ, the
   Redeemer of the world. And then, he added, that he would be raised for
   a sign to the Gentiles, that might be to them for salvation. The words
   do indeed differ a little from the Hebrew text; for we read here,
   arise, while in Hebrew it is stand for a sign, which is the same; for
   he was to appear conspicuous like a sign. What is here hope, is in
   Hebrew seek; but according to the most common usage of Scripture, to
   seek God is nothing else but to hope in him. [448]

   But twice in this prophecy is the calling of the Gentiles confirmed, --
   by the expression, that Christ was to be raised up as a sign, and he
   reigns among the faithful alone, -- and by the declaration, that they
   shall hope in Christ, which cannot take place without the preaching of
   the word and illumination of the Spirit. With these things corresponds
   the song of Simeon. It may be further added, that hope in Christ is an
   evidence of his divinity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [444] In gloriam Dei, eis doxan Theou, i.e., in order to set forth the
   glory of God, or, in other words, that God might be glorified. So
   Erasmus, Chalmers, and Stuart. Others regard this "glory" as that which
   God bestows, even eternal happiness, according to this meaning, --
   "Receive ye one another into communion and fellowship, as Christ has
   received you into the glory of God," that is, into that glorious state
   which God has provided and promised. See John 17:24. For "you," our
   version has "us;" but Griesbach considers "you" as the true reading. --
   Ed.

   [445] The beginning of this verse, "Now I say," Dico autem, Lego de, is
   read by Beza and Grotius, Lego gar, "For I say," and Griesbach regards
   it of nearly equal authority. If we retain de, it may be rendered
   "moreover," or "further;" and to render the clause more distinct, the
   word "this," as proposed by Beza and Pagninus, may be added, -- "I
   further say this," etc. The two verses may be thus rendered, -- 8. I
   further say this, that Christ became a minister of the circumcision for
   the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises made to 9. the
   fathers, and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it
   is written, "I will therefore confess thee among the nations, and to
   thy name will I sing." The reasons for this rendering are given in the
   next note. -- Ed.

   [446] The construction of this first sentence is differently viewed.
   Grotius and Stuart connect it with "I say" at the beginning of the
   former verse; but Beza and Pareus connect it with the last clause, and
   consider eis to as being here understood: and this seems to be the best
   construction. Christ became the minister of the circumcision, a
   minister under the Abrahamic economy, for two objects, -- that he might
   confirm the promises made to the Fathers, -- and that the Gentiles
   might glorify God for his mercy. Mercy was destined to come to the
   Gentiles through the covenant made with Abraham, of which circumcision
   was the sign and seal. The promise, "In thee shall the nations of the
   earth be blessed," was made to Abraham, and not to the Gentiles. Hence
   it is called "mercy" to them, there being the previous promise made
   distinctly to them, while the same mercy as to the Jews is called
   "truth," because it was the fulfillment of a promise. A remarkable
   instance of this difference, noticed by Haldane, is found in Micah
   7:20. What is said to be "mercy" to Abraham, to whom the promise was
   first made, is said to be "truth" to Jacob, to whom it was confirmed.
   It may also, by the way, be observed, that this verse in Micah affords
   an example of what we often find in Paul's style; for in mentioning two
   or more things, he often reverses the regular order. What Micah
   mentions first is "truth" to Jacob, and then he goes back to God's
   "mercy" to Abraham. The quotation from Psalm 18:49, is verbatim from
   the Septuagint. The Hebrew verb with its postfix, 'vdk, in our version,
   "I will give thanks to thee," may more properly be rendered, "I will
   confess thee." -- Ed.

   [447] This passage is evidently taken from Deuteronomy 32:43, given
   literally as it is found in the Septuagint, and literally too from the
   Hebrew, if the reading of two copies, referred to by Kennicalt, be
   adopted, in which 't, "with," is placed before sv, "his people." It is
   no objection that "adversaries" are mentioned in the context. There
   have ever been adversaries to God's people; and God even now denounces
   his judgments on his adversaries, though the Gentiles as a people, as a
   separate class from the Jews, have been long ago admitted to the
   privilege of rejoicing with his people. -- Ed.

   [448] Isaiah 11:10. The whole of this quotation is given as it is found
   in the Septuagint. The difference, as noticed by Calvin, between the
   words as given in Hebrew, is considerable. The language of the Prophet
   is metaphorical, the Septuagint interpreted it, and this interpretation
   the Apostle approved and adopted. The Messiah is represented by the
   Prophet as a general or a leader of an army, raising his banner for the
   nations, (mys, not "people," as in our version:) and the Gentiles
   repair or resort to this banner for protection; and so Lowth renders
   the verb ydrsv, only he does not preserve the metaphor, by rendering
   'lyv, "unto him," instead of "to it," as in our version. It hence
   appears evident, that the passage is substantially the same; and indeed
   the verb archein, retains in some measure the idea of the original, for
   it strictly means to be a leader, to rule as a chief. -- Ed.

   13. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
   that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.

   13. Deus autem spei impleat vos omni gaudio et pace in credendo, quo
   abundetis in spe per potentiam Spiritus sancti.

   14. And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also
   are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish
   one another.

   14. Persuasus autem sum, fratres mei, ipse quoque de vobis, quod et
   ipsi pleni sitis bonitate, referti omni cognitione, idonei ad vos mutuo
   admonendos.

   15. Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in
   some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given
   to me of God,

   15. Audacius antera scripsi vobis, fratres, ex parte, veluti
   commonefaciens vos, propter gratiam mihi datam a Deo;

   16. That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
   ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles
   might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

   16. Ut sim minister Christi erga Gentes, consecrans evangelium Christi,
   ut sit oblatio Gentium acceptabilis, sanctificata per Spiritum sanctum.

   13. And may the God, etc. He now concludes the passage, as before, with
   prayer; in which he desires the Lord to give them whatever he had
   commanded. It hence appears, that the Lord does in no degree measure
   his precepts according to our strength or the power of free-will; and
   that he does not command what we ought to do, that we, relying on our
   own power, may gird up ourselves to render obedience; but that he
   commands those things which require the aid of his grace, that he may
   stimulate us in our attention to prayer.

   In saying the God of hope, he had in view the last verse; as though he
   said, -- "May then the God in whom we all hope fill you with joy, that
   is, with cheerfulness of heart, and also with unity and concord, and
   this by believing:" [449] for in order that our peace may be approved
   by God, we must be bound together by real and genuine faith. If any one
   prefers taking in believing, for, in order to believe, [450] the sense
   will be, -- that they were to cultivate peace for the purpose of
   believing; for then only are we rightly prepared to believe, when we,
   being peaceable and unanimous, do willingly embrace what is taught us.
   It is however preferable, that faith should be connected with peace and
   joy; for it is the bond of holy and legitimate concord, and the support
   of godly joy. And though the peace which one has within with God may
   also be understood, yet the context leads us rather to the former
   explanation. [451]

   He further adds, that ye may abound in hope; for in this way also is
   hope confirmed and increased in us. The words, through the power of the
   Holy Spirit, intimate that all things are the gifts of the divine
   bounty: and the word power is intended emphatically to set forth that
   wonderful energy, by which the Spirit works in us faith, hope, joy, and
   peace.

   14. But even I myself am persuaded, etc. This was said to anticipate an
   objection, or it may be deemed a kind of concession, made with the view
   of pacifying the Romans; in case they thought themselves reproved by so
   many and so urgent admonitions, and thus unjustly treated. He then
   makes an excuse for having ventured to assume towards them the
   character of a teacher and of an exhorter; and he says, that he had
   done so, not because he had any doubt as to their wisdom, or kindness,
   or perseverance; but because he was constrained by his office. Thus he
   removed every suspicion of presumption, which especially shows itself
   when any one thrusts himself into an office which does not belong to
   him, or speaks of those things which are unsuitable to him. We see in
   this instance the singular modesty of this holy man, to whom nothing
   was more acceptable than to be thought of no account, provided the
   doctrine he preached retained its authority.

   There was much pride in the Romans; the name even of their city made
   the lowest of the people proud; so that they could hardly bear a
   teacher of another nation, much less a barbarian and a Jew. With this
   haughtiness Paul would not contend in his own private name: he however
   subdued it, as it were, by soothing means; for he testified that he
   undertook to address them on account of his Apostolic office.

   Ye are full of goodness, being filled with knowledge, etc. Two
   qualifications are especially necessary for him who gives admonitions:
   the first is kindness, which disposes his mind to aid his brethren by
   his advice, and also tempers his countenance and his words with
   courtesy, -- and the second is skill in advice or prudence, which
   secures authority to him, inasmuch as he is able to benefit the hearers
   whom he addresses. There is indeed nothing more opposed to brotherly
   admonitions than malignity and arrogance, which make us disdainfully to
   despise the erring, and to treat them with ridicule, rather than to set
   them right. Asperity also, whether it appears in words or in the
   countenance, deprives our admonitions of their fruit. But however you
   may excel in the feeling of kindness, as well as in courtesy, you are
   not yet fit to advise, except you possess wisdom and experience. Hence
   he ascribes both these qualifications to the Romans, bearing them a
   testimony, -- that they were themselves sufficiently competent, without
   the help of another, to administer mutual exhortations: for he admits,
   that they abounded both in kindness and wisdom. It hence follows, that
   they were able to exhort.

   15. The more boldly, however, have I written to you, etc. The excuse
   follows, and in adducing this, that he might more fully show his
   modesty, he says, by way of concession, that he acted boldly in
   interposing in a matter which they themselves were able to do; but he
   adds that he was led to be thus bold on account of his office, because
   he was the minister of the gospel to the Gentiles, and could not
   therefore pass by them who were also Gentiles. He however thus humbles
   himself, that he might exalt the excellency of his office; for by
   mentioning the favor of God, by which he was elevated to that high
   honor, he shows that he could not suffer what he did according to his
   apostolic office to be despised. Besides, he denies that he had assumed
   the part of a teacher, but that of an admonisher, [452]

   16. Consecrating the gospel, etc. This rendering I prefer to that which
   Erasmus in the first place adopts, that is, "Administering;" for
   nothing is more certain than that Paul here alludes to the holy
   mysteries which were performed by the priest. He then makes himself a
   chief priest or a priest in the ministration of the gospel, to offer up
   as a sacrifice the people whom he gained for God, and in this manner he
   labored in the holy mysteries of the gospel. And doubtless this is the
   priesthood of the Christian pastor, that is, to sacrifice men, as it
   were, to God, by bringing them to obey the gospel, and not, as the
   Papists have hitherto haughtily vaunted, by offering up Christ to
   reconcile men to God. He does not, however, give here the name of
   priests to the pastors of the Church simply as a perpetual title, but
   intending to commend the honor and power of the ministry, Paul availed
   himself of the opportunity of using this metaphor. Let then the
   preachers of the gospel have this end in view while discharging their
   office, even to offer up to God souls purified by faith.

   What Erasmus afterwards puts down as being more correct, "sacrificing
   the gospel," is not only improper but obscures also the meaning; for
   the gospel is, on the contrary, like a sword, by which the minister
   sacrifices men as victims to God. [453]

   He adds that such sacrifices are acceptable to God; which is not only a
   commendation of the ministry, but also a singular consolation to those
   who surrender themselves to be thus consecrated. Now as the ancient
   victims were dedicated to God, having been externally sanctified and
   washed, so these victims are consecrated to the Lord by the Spirit of
   holiness, through whose power, inwardly working in them, they are
   separated from this world. For though the purity of the soul proceeds
   from faith in the word, yet as the voice of man is in itself
   inefficacious and lifeless, the work of cleansing really and properly
   belongs to the Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [449] The God of hope may mean one of two things, -- the giver or
   author of hope, as in 1 Peter 1:3, -- or the object of hope, he in whom
   hope is placed, as in 1 Timothy 6:17. Why does he mention joy before
   peace? It is in accordance with his usual manner, -- the most visible,
   the stream first, then the most hidden, the spring. -- Ed.

   [450] That is eis to, instead of en to. -- Ed.

   [451] This is the view approved by Theophylact, Beza, Grotius, Mede,
   and Hammond: but Doddridge, Scott, Stuart, and Chalmers consider
   "peace" here to be that with God, and "joy" as its accompaniment; while
   Pareus and Hodge view both as included, especially the latter. If we
   consider the subject in hand, that the Apostle was attempting to
   produce union and concord between the Jews and the Gentiles, we shall
   see reason to accede to Calvin's explanations. This joy and peace seem
   to be the same as in Romans 14:17. Concord, union, and mutual
   enjoyment, are graces which come by believing, or by faith, as well as
   concord or peace with God, and its accompanying joy; and these graces
   have no doubt an influence on hope, so as to make it brighter and
   stronger, when they are produced by the Holy Spirit. There are three
   things which distinguish these graces from such as are fictitious, --
   they proceed from faith, -- they increase hope, -- they are produced by
   the Spirit. -- Ed.

   [452] It does not clearly appear what meaning Calvin attached to the
   words apo merous, which he renders ex parte. Some, like Origen, connect
   the expression with the verb, "I have written to you in part," that is,
   not fully, which seems to have no meaning consistently with the evident
   tenor of the passage. Others, as Chrysostom, Erasmus, and Pareus,
   connect the words with the adjective, "I have in part (or somewhat)
   more boldly (or more freely, or more confidently) written to you."
   Macknight connects them with the following clause, "partly as calling
   things to your remembrance." Doddridge and Stuart render them "in this
   part of the Epistle." The most suitable view is to consider them as
   qualifying the adjective. -- Ed.

   [453] "Consecrans evangelium," so Augustine; hierourgounta to
   euangelion, "operans evangelio -- being employed in the gospel," Beza
   and Pareus; "docens sacrum evangelium -- teaching the holy gospel,"
   Vatablus. The verb means to "perform sacred rites," or to officiate in
   holy things. It has no connection, as some think, with a sacrificing
   priest; indeed hiereus itself, that is a priest, is a holy person, who
   did sacrifice no doubt among other things, but the word does not import
   a sacrificer any more than khn in Hebrew. The word here does not mean
   to consecrate, or to sanctify, or to sacrifice, but to discharge a holy
   function. Perhaps the most literal rendering would be "performing a
   holy office as to the gospel," but dispensing, administering, or
   preaching the gospel would be the best version. The Apostle had
   previously called himself leitourgon, a public functionary, a public
   minister of Jesus Christ; he now designates his work as such, being a
   sacred administrator of the gospel, and then he states the object, that
   the offering of the Gentiles, that is, that the Gentiles being offered,
   might be an acceptable sacrifice to God, sanctified by the Spirit. See
   Romans 12:1. -- Ed.

   Romans 15:17-21

   17. I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those
   things which pertain to God.

   17. Habeo igitur quod glorier per Iesum Christum in iis quae ad Deum
   pertinent.

   18. For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ
   hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and
   deed,

   18. Non enim ausim loqui quicquam de iis quae non effecit Christus per
   me, in obedientiam Gentium, sermone et opere;

   19. Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of
   God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have
   fully preached the gospel of Christ.

   19. In potentia signorum et prodigiorum, in potentia Spiritus Dei, ut
   ab Ierusalem et in circuitu usque in Illyricum impleverim evangelium
   Christi:

   20. Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was
   named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

   20. Ira annitens praedicare evangelium, non ubi nominatus erat
   Christus, ne super alienum fundamentum aedificarem;

   21. But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see:
   and they that have not heard shall understand.

   21. Sed quemadmodum scripture est, Ii quibus non annuntiatum est de eo,
   videbunt, et qui non audierunt, intelligent.

   17. I have then, etc. After having in general commended his own
   calling, that the Romans might know that he was a true and undoubted
   apostle of Christ, he now adds testimonies, by which he proved that he
   had not only taken upon him the apostolic office conferred on him by
   God's appointment, but that he had also eminently adorned it. He at the
   same time records the fidelity which he had exhibited in discharging
   his office. It is indeed to little purpose that we are appointed,
   except we act agreeably to our calling and fulfill our office. He did
   not make this declaration from a desire to attain glow, but because
   nothing was to be omitted which might procure favor and authority to
   his doctrine among the Romans. In God then, not in himself, did he
   glory; for he had nothing else in view but that the whole praise should
   redound to God.

   And that he speaks only negatively, it is indeed an evidence of his
   modesty, but it availed also to gain credit to what he was proceeding
   to announce, as though he said, "The truth itself affords me such cause
   for glowing, that I have no need to seek false praises, or those of
   another, I am content with such as are true." It may be also that he
   intended to obviate the unfavorable reports which he knew were
   everywhere scattered by the malevolent, he therefore mentioned
   beforehand that he would not speak but of things well known.

   18. In order to make the Gentiles obedient, etc. These words prove what
   his object was, even to render his ministry approved by the Romans,
   that his doctrine might not be without fruit. He proves then by
   evidences that God by the presence of his power had given a testimony
   to his preaching, and in a manner sealed his apostleship, so that no
   one ought to have doubted, but, that he was appointed and sent by the
   Lord. The evidences were word, work, and miracles. It hence appears
   that the term work includes more than miracles. He at last concludes
   with this expression, through the power of the Spirit; by which he
   intimates that these things could not have been done without the Spirit
   being the author. In short, he declares that with regard to his
   teaching as well as his doing, he had such strength and energy in
   preaching Christ, that it was evidently the wonderful power of God, and
   that miracles were also added, which were seals to render the evidence
   more certain.

   He mentions word and work in the first place, and then he states one
   kind of work, even the power of performing miracles. The same order is
   observed by Luke, when he says that Christ was mighty in word and work,
   (Luke 24:19;) and John says that Christ referred the Jews to his own
   works for a testimony of his divinity. (John 5:36.) Nor does he simply
   mention miracles, but gives them two designations. But instead of what
   he says here, the power of signs and of wonders, Peter has "miracles
   and signs and wonders." (Acts 2:22.) And doubtless they were
   testimonies of divine power to awaken men, that being struck with God's
   power, they might admire and at the same time adore him; nor are they
   without an especial meaning, but intended to stimulate us, that we may
   understand what God is.

   This is a striking passage respecting the benefit of miracles: they are
   designed to prepare men to reverence and to obey God. So you read in
   Mark, that the Lord confirmed the truth by the signs which followed.
   (Mark 16:20.) Luke declares in the Acts, that the Lord by miracles gave
   testimony to the word of his grace. (Acts 14:3.) It is then evident
   that those miracles which bring glory to creatures and not to God,
   which secure credit to lies and not to God's word, are from the devil.
   The power of the Spirit, which he mentions in the third place, I apply
   to both the preceding clauses. [454]

   19. So that from Jerusalem, etc. He joins also a testimony from the
   effect; for the success which followed his preaching exceeded all the
   thoughts of men. For who could have gathered so many churches for
   Christ, without being aided by the power of God? "From Jerusalem," he
   says, "I have propagated the gospel as far as Illyricum, and not by
   hastening to the end of my course by a straight way, but by going all
   around, and through the intervening countries." But the verb
   peplerokenai, which after others I have rendered filled up or
   completed, means both to perfect and to supply what is wanting. Hence
   pleroma in Greek means perfection as well as a supplement. I am
   disposed to explain it thus, -- that he diffused, as it were by filling
   up, the preaching of the gospel; for others had before begun, but he
   spread it wider. [455]

   20. Thus striving to preach the gospel, etc. As it was necessary for
   Paul not only to prove himself to be the servant of Christ and a pastor
   of the Christian Church, but also to show his title to the character
   and office of an Apostle, that he might gain the attention of the
   Romans, he mentions here the proper and peculiar distinction of the
   apostleship; for the work of an Apostle is to propagate the gospel
   where it had not been preached, according to that command,

   "Go ye, preach the gospel to every creature." (Mark 16:15.)

   And this is what we ought carefully to notice, lest we make a general
   rule of what specially belongs to the Apostolic order: nor ought we to
   consider it a fault, that a successor was substituted who built up the
   Church. The Apostles then were the founders as it were of the Church;
   the pastors who succeeded them, had to strengthen and amplify the
   building raised up by them. [456] He calls that another's foundation,
   which had been laid by the hand of another: otherwise Christ is the
   only stone on which the Church is founded. See 1 Corinthians 3:11; and
   Ephesians 2:20

   21. But as it is written, etc. He confirms by the testimony of Isaiah
   what he had said of the evidence of his apostleship; for in Isaiah
   52:15, speaking of the kingdom of Messiah, among other things he
   predicts, that the knowledge of Christ would be spread among the
   Gentiles throughout the whole world, that his name would be declared to
   those by whom it had not been heard of before. It was meet that this
   should be done by the Apostles, to whom the command was specifically
   given. Hence the apostleship of Paul was made evident from this
   circumstance, -- that this prophecy was fulfilled in him. [457]

   It is absurd for any one to attempt to apply what is here said to the
   pastoral office; for we know that in Churches rightly formed, where the
   truth of the gospel has been already received, Christ's name must be
   constantly preached. Paul then was a preacher of Christ, yet unknown to
   foreign nations, for this end, -- that after his departure the same
   doctrine should be daily proclaimed in every place by the mouth of the
   pastors; for it is certain that the Prophet speaks of the commencement
   of the kingdom of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [454] Some, as Beza and Grotius, understand by the last clause,
   "through the power of the Spirit of God," the internal power of
   speaking with tongues, etc., and by "signs and wonders," the external
   work of healing the sick, etc. But this passage is evidently an
   instance of the Apostle's usual mode of stating things. "Word" means
   preaching; and "work," the doing of miracles. He first specifies the
   last, the work was that of "signs and wonders;" and then he mentions
   what belongs to the first, and shows how it became effectual, that is,
   through the power of the Spirit. See a similar arrangement in 1
   Corinthians 6:11; where he mentions washed, sanctified and justified;
   and then he mentions first what belongs to the last, "in the name of
   the Lord Jesus," and afterwards what appertains to the first words,
   "and by the Spirit of our God." "Signs and wonders" are often mentioned
   together: they designate the same things by different names: miracles
   were called "signs," because they were evidences of divine power, and
   they were called "wonders," or prodigies, because they were not
   according to the course of nature, but were extraordinary things. By
   these words their design and character are set forth. -- Ed.

   [455] The clause is rendered by Beza and Grotius, "Impleverim
   praedicandi evangelii Christi munus -- I have fulfilled the office of
   preaching the gospel of Christ." The gospel is put for preaching the
   gospel. See Acts 12:25; Colossians 1:25 Vatablus renders the verb
   "plene annunciaverim -- I have fully announced;" and Mede,
   "propagaverim -- I have propagated." Some, as Wolfius and Vitringa,
   think the verb is used in a sense borrowed from Hebrew: the verb gmr,
   which in its common meaning is to fill or to finish, is used in the
   sense of teaching, not indeed in the Hebrew bible, but in the Talmud.
   That the idea of teaching, or propagating, or preaching, belongs to it
   here, and in Colossians 1:25, is evident. The notion of filling up,
   which Calvin gives to it, is hardly consistent with what the Apostle
   says in Romans 15:20. The full preaching is referred by Erasmus, not to
   its extent, but to its fidelity, "omitting nothing which a faithful
   evangelist ought to have proclaimed." -- Ed.

   [456] The participle, "striving," rendered annitens by Calvin and by
   Erasmus, is philotimoumenos, which means to strive honorably: it is to
   seek a thing as an object of honor or ambition. It may be rendered
   here, "honorably striving;" Doddridge has, "It hath been the object of
   my ambition;" Stuart, "I was strongly desirous;" and Wolfius, "honori
   mihi ducentem -- esteeming it an honor to me." It is used to express
   both an honorable and an earnest or diligent pursuit. It is found in
   two other places, teeming it an honor," or, "Being ambitious." -- Ed.

   [457] Isaiah 52:15. The quotation is literally from the Septuagint, and
   is nearly according to the Hebrew, only the tense is altered, it being
   the past in that language, as prophecies are often found to be, in
   order to show their certainty. The Hebrew is as follows, -- For what
   had not been told them, have they seen,^
   And what they had not heard, have they understood. To render the last
   verb "consider," as in our version, is not proper; it means to
   distinguish between things, to discern, to understand. It bears
   strictly the same meaning with the Greek verb here used. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 15:22-24

   22. For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.

   22. Itaque impeditus etiam saepius fui quominus venirem ad vos:

   23. But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great
   desire these many years to come unto you;

   23. Nunc vero nullum amplius locum habens in his regionibus, desiderium
   autem habens a multis annis veniendi ad vos;

   24. Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I
   trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward
   by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company

   24. Si quando in Hispaniam proficiscar, veniam ad vos: [458] spero enim
   fore ut istac iter faciens videam vos, et illuc a vobis deducar, si
   tamen prius ex parte vestra consuetudine fuero expletus.

   22. And on this account, etc. What he had said of his apostleship he
   applies now to another point, even for the purpose of excusing himself
   for not having come to them, though he was destined for them as well as
   for others. He, in passing, then intimates, that in propagating the
   gospel from Judea as far as to Illyricum, he performed, as it were, a
   certain course enjoined him by the Lord; which being accomplished, he
   purposed not to neglect them. And lest they should yet think that they
   had been neglected, he removes this suspicion by testifying, that there
   had been for a long time no want of desire. Hence, that he had not done
   this sooner was owing to a just impediment: he now gives them a hope,
   as soon as his calling allowed him.

   From this passage is drawn a weak argument respecting his going to
   Spain. It does not indeed immediately follow that he performed this
   journey, because he intended it: for he speaks only of hope, in which
   he, as other faithful men, might have been sometimes frustrated. [459]

   24. For I hope, etc. He refers to the reason why he had for a long time
   wished to come to them, and now intended to do so, -- even that he
   might see them, enjoy an interview and an intercourse with them, and
   make himself known to them in his official character; for by the coming
   of the Apostles the gospel also came.

   By saying, to be brought on my way thither by you, he intimates how
   much he expected from their kindness; and this, as we have already
   observed, is the best way for conciliating favor; for the more
   confidence any one hears is reposed in him, the stronger are the
   obligations under which he feels himself; inasmuch as we deem it base
   and discourteous to disappoint the good opinion formed of us. And by
   adding, When I shall first be in part filled, etc., he bears witness to
   the benevolence of his mind towards them; and to convince them of this
   was very necessary for the interest of the gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [458] This clause, and gar in the next, Griesbach dismisses as being
   spurious: then the verse would be, -- 24. "Whenever I go into Spain, I
   hope, in passing through, to see you, and to be by you sent there, when
   I shall first be in a measure refreshed by you;" or, literally, "filled
   with you;" or it may be rendered, "satisfied with you." The Vulgate
   renders the words, "Si vobis primum ex parte fruitus fuero -- when I
   shall first in part enjoy you, i.e., your society. Stuart's version is,
   "When I am in part first satisfied with your company." The expression,
   "in part," seems to imply that his stay would not be long. -- Ed.

   [459] On this subject Wolfius says, "Paul's journey to Spain was
   unknown to Origen and Eusebius; nor does it comport with the records
   connected with him. The Apostle, when freed from the chains of Nero,
   did not go to Spain, but to Asia; and there is no vestige of a Church
   founded by Paul in Spain. Basnage has carefully examined this subject
   as well as W. Wall in his critical Notes in English on the New
   Testament." As is common in many things connected with antiquity,
   fathers later than Origen and Eusebius came to know of this journey,
   but how, it is not easy to know: and in process of time various
   particulars were discovered, or rather invented, in connection with
   this journey. It is something similar to the story of Peter being the
   founder of the Church of Rome. -- Ed.

   Romans 15:25-29

   25. But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

   25. Nunc vero proficiscor Ierosolymam ad ministrandum sanctis.

   26. For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain
   contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

   26. Placuit enim Macedoniae et Achaiae communicationem facere in
   pauperes sanctos qui sunt Ierosolymis:

   27. It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the
   Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty
   is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

   27. Placuit, inquam, et debitores sunt ipsorum; si enim spiritualibus
   ipsorum communicarunt Gentes, debent et in carnalibus [460] ministrare
   ipsis.

   28. When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this
   fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

   28. Hoc igitur quum perfecero, et obsignavero illis fructum hunc,
   pro-ficiscar per vos in Hispaniam.

   29. And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
   fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

   29. Scio autem quod quum venero ad vos, in plenitudine benedictionis
   evangelii Christi venturus sum.

   25. But I am going now, etc. Lest they should expect his immediate
   coming, and think themselves deceived, if he had not come according to
   their expectation, he declares to them what business he had then in
   hand, which prevented him from going soon to them, and that was, --
   that he was going to Jerusalem to bear the alms which had been gathered
   in Macedonia and Achaia. Availing himself at the same time of this
   opportunity, he proceeds to commend that contribution; by which, as by
   a kind of intimation, he stirs them up to follow this example: for
   though he does not openly ask them, yet, by saying that Macedonia and
   Achaia had done what they ought to have done, he intimates, that it was
   also the duty of the Romans, as they were under the same obligation;
   and that he had this view, he openly confesses to the Corinthians, --

   "I boast," he says, "of your promptitude to all the Churches, that they
   may be stirred up by your example."
   (2 Corinthians 9:2.)

   It was indeed a rare instance of kindness, that the Grecians, having
   heard that their brethren at Jerusalem were laboring under want,
   considered not the distance at which they were separated from them; but
   esteeming those sufficiently nigh, to whom they were united by the bond
   of faith, they relieved their necessities from their own abundance. The
   word communication, which is here employed, ought to be noticed; for it
   well expresses the feeling, by which it behooves us to succor the wants
   of our brethren, even because there is to be a common and mutual regard
   on account of the unity of the body. I have not rendered the pronoun
   tina, because it is often redundant in Greek, and seems to lessen the
   emphasis of this passage. [461] What we have rendered to minister, is
   in Greek a participle, ministering; but the former seems more fitted to
   convey the meaning of Paul: for he excuses himself, that by a lawful
   occupation he was prevented from going immediately to Rome.

   27. And their debtors they are, etc. Every one perceives, that what is
   said here of obligation, is said not so much for the sake of the
   Corinthians as for the Romans themselves; for the Corinthians or the
   Macedonians were not more indebted to the Jews than the Romans. And he
   adds the ground of this obligation, -- that they had received the
   gospel from them: and he takes his argument from the comparison of the
   less with the greater. He employs also the same in another place, that
   is, that it ought not to have appeared to them an unjust or a grievous
   compensation to exchange carnal things, which are immensely of less
   value, for things spiritual. (2 Corinthians 9:11.) And it shows the
   value of the gospel, when he declares, that they were indebted not only
   to its ministers, but also to the whole nation, from whom they had come
   forth.

   And mark the verb leitourgosai, to minister; which means to discharge
   one's office in the commonwealth, and to undergo the burden of one's
   calling: it is also sometimes applied to sacred things. Nor do I doubt
   but that Paul meant that it is a kind of sacrifice, when the faithful
   gave of their own to relieve the wants of their brethren; for they thus
   perform that duty of love which they owe, and offer to God a sacrifice
   of an acceptable odor. But in this place what he had peculiarly in view
   was the mutual right of compensation.

   28. And sealed to them this fruit, etc. I disapprove not of what some
   think, that there is here an allusion to a practice among the ancients,
   who closed up with their seals what they intended to lay up in safety.
   Thus Paul commends his own faithfulness and integrity; as though he had
   said, that he was an honest keeper of the money deposited in his hands,
   no otherwise than if he carried it sealed up. [462] -- The word fruit
   seems to designate the produce, which he had before said returned to
   the Jews from the propagation of the gospel, in a way similar to the
   land, which by bringing forth fruit supports its cultivator.

   29. And I know, that when I come, etc. These words may be explained in
   two ways: the first meaning is, -- that he should find a plentiful
   fruit from the gospel at Rome; for the blessing of the gospel is, when
   it fructifies by good works: but to confine this to alms, as some do,
   is not what I approve. The second is, that in order to render his
   coming to them more an object of desire, he says, that he hopes that it
   would not be unfruitful, but that it would make a great accession to
   the gospel; and this he calls fullness of blessing, which signifies a
   full blessing; by which expression he means great success and increase.
   But this blessing depended partly on his ministry and partly on their
   faith. Hence he promises, that his coming to them would not be in vain,
   as he would not disappoint them of the grace given to him, but would
   bestow it with the same alacrity with which their minds were prepared
   to receive the gospel.

   The former exposition has been most commonly received, and seems also
   to me the best; that is, that he hoped that at his coming he would find
   what he especially wished, even that the gospel flourished among them
   and prevailed with evident success, -- that they were excelling in
   holiness and in all other virtues. For the reason he gives for his
   desire is, that he hoped for no common joy in seeing them, as he
   expected to see them abounding in all the spiritual riches of the
   gospel. [463]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [460] "In carnalibus;" en tois sarkikois. The word "carnal" in our
   language does not convey the meaning. The Apostle uses it here in
   opposition to what is "spiritual," and therefore "temporal" expresses
   its meaning. See 1 Corinthians 9:11. It sometimes means "human," as in
   2 Corinthians 1:12, where man's wisdom is set in contrast with God's
   wisdom. In 2 Corinthians 10:4, it means "weak," or feeble, or
   powerless, being opposed to the "mighty" weapons of God. It has its own
   proper meaning in Romans 7:14, and in 1 Peter 2:11, "carnal," that is,
   wicked, sinful, corrupt, depraved. In 1 Corinthians 3:1, it signifies
   weak, ignorant, imperfect in knowledge, as opposed to spiritual and
   enlightened persons. And in Hebrews 7:16, it expresses what is fleeting
   and transitory. In no language is there one word which can convey all
   the meanings of a similar word in another: hence the necessity of
   changing a word sometimes in a translation. -- Ed.

   [461] The words are, koinonian tina poiesasthai, "to make a certain
   contribution," or, "some contribution," or, as Doddridge has it, "a
   certain collection." There seems to be no necessity for leaving out the
   word tina. -- Ed.

   [462] More satisfactory is the explanation of Stuart: he says, that the
   word "sealed" means that the instrument to which a seal is applied is
   authenticated, made valid, i.e., "sure to answer the purpose intended.
   So here the Apostle would not stop short in the performance of his
   duty, as the almoner of the Churches, until he had seen the actual
   distribution of their charity." It seems then that "sealed" here means
   "secured," or safely conveyed. "Delivered to them safely," is the
   paraphrase of Hammond. -- Ed.

   [463] This explanation is that of Chrysostom; but how to make the words
   to give such a meaning is a matter of some difficulty. The obvious
   import of the passage corresponds with Romans 1:11. All the authors
   quoted by Poole, except Estius, take the other view, such as Grotius,
   Beza, Mede, etc. The last gives the following as the sentiments of
   Origen and Anselm -- "My preaching and conversation shall impart to you
   an abundant knowledge of the gospel mysteries, love, comfort, grace,
   and spiritual fruit." The word "blessing," eulogia, is said by Grotius
   to mean everything that is freely bestowed on us. See Galatians 3:14;
   Ephesians 1:3. The words tou euangeliou tou, are not considered genuine
   by Griesbach and by most critics. This makes no difference in the
   meaning: the clause then would be, -- "With the fullness of the
   blessings of Christ," or, with the abounding blessings of Christ; or,
   as Beza renders it, "with the full blessing of Christ." -- Ed.

   Romans 15:30-33

   30. Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and
   for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your
   prayers to God for me;

   30. Obsecro autem vos fratres, per Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum et
   per dilectionem Spiritus, ut concertetis mihi in precibus vestris pro
   me ad Deum;

   31. That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea;
   and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the
   saints;

   31. Ut liberer ab incredulis in Iudea, et ut ministerium meum quod
   suscipio erga Ierusalem acceptum sit sanctis;

   32. That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with
   you be refreshed.

   32. Ut cum gaudio veniam ad vos per voluntatem Dei, unique vobiscum
   refociller.

   33. Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

   33. Deus autem pacis sit cure omnibus vobis. Amen. [464]

   30. Now I beseech you, etc. It is well known from many passages how
   much ill-will prevailed against Paul in his own nation on account of
   false reports, as though he taught a departure from Moses. He knew how
   much calumnies might avail to oppress the innocent, especially among
   those who are carried away by inconsiderate zeal. Added also to this,
   was the testimony of the Spirit, recorded in Acts 20:23; by which he
   was forewarned, that bonds and afflictions awaited him at Jerusalem.
   The more danger then he perceived, the more he was moved: hence it was,
   that he was so solicitous to commend his safety to the Churches; nor
   let us wonder, that he was anxious about his life, in which he knew so
   much danger to the Church was involved.

   He then shows how grieved his godly mind was, by the earnest
   protestation he makes, in which he adds to the name of the Lord, the
   love of the Spirit, by which the saints ought to embrace one another.
   But though in so great a fear, he yet continued to proceed; nor did he
   so dread danger, but that he was prepared willingly to meet it. At the
   same time he had recourse to the remedies given him by God; for he
   solicited the aid of the Church, so that being helped by its prayers,
   he might find comfort, according to the Lord's promise, --

   "Where two or three shall assemble in my name, there in the midst of
   them am I," (Matthew 18:20;)

   and,

   "Whatsoever they agree in on earth, they shall obtain in heaven,"
   (Matthew 18:19.)

   And lest no one should think it an unmeaning commendation, he besought
   them both by Christ and by the love of the Spirit. The love of the
   Spirit is that by which Christ joins us together; for it is not that of
   the flesh, nor of the world, but is from his Spirit, who is the bond of
   our unity.

   Since then it is so great a favor from God to be helped by the prayers
   of the faithful, that even Paul, a most choice instrument of God, did
   not think it right to neglect this privilege, how great must be our
   stupidity, if we, who are abject and worthless creatures, disregard it?
   But to take a handle from such passages for the purpose of maintaining
   the intercessions of dead saints, is an instance of extreme effrontery.
   [465]

   That ye strive together with me, [466] etc. Erasmus has not given an
   unsuitable rendering, "That ye help me laboring:" but, as the Greek
   word, used by Paul, has more force, I have preferred to give a literal
   rendering: for by the word strive, or contend, he alludes to the
   difficulties by which he was oppressed, and by bidding them to assist
   in this contest, he shows how the godly ought to pray for their
   brethren, that they are to assume their person, as though they were
   placed in the same difficulties; and he also intimates the effect which
   they have; for he who commends his brother to the Lord, by taking to
   himself a part of his distress, do so far relieve him. And indeed if
   our strength is derived from prayer to God, we can in no better way
   confirm our brethren, than by praying to God for them.

   31. That my ministration, etc. Slanderers had so prevailed by their
   accusations, that he even feared that the present would hardly be
   acceptable, as coming from his hands, which otherwise, under such a
   distress, would have been very seasonable. And hence appears his
   wonderful meekness, for he ceased not to labor for those to whom he
   doubted whether he would be acceptable. This disposition of mind we
   ought to imitate, so that we may not cease to do good to those of whose
   gratitude we are by no means certain. We must also notice that he
   honors with the name of saints even those by whom he feared he would be
   suspected, and deemed unwelcome. He also knew that, saints may
   sometimes be led away by false slanders into unfavorable opinions, and
   though he knew that they wronged him, he yet ceased not to speak
   honorably of them.

   By adding that I may come to you, he intimates that this prayer would
   be profitable also to them, and that it concerned them that he should
   not be killed in Judea. To the same purpose is the expression with joy;
   for it would be advantageous to the Romans for him to come to them in a
   cheerful state of mind and free from all grief, that he might in a more
   lively and strenuous manner labor among them. And by the word
   refreshed, [467] or satisfied, he again shows how fully persuaded he
   was of their brotherly love. The words by the will of God remind us how
   necessary it is to be diligent in prayer, for God alone directs all our
   ways by his providence.

   And the God of peace, [468] etc. From the universal word all, I
   conclude that he did not simply pray that God would be present with and
   favor the Romans in a general sense, but that he would rule and guide
   every one of them. But the word peace refers, I think, to their
   circumstances at the time, that God, the author of peace, would keep
   them all united together.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [464] The word "Amen," is regarded as spurious: Griesbach and other
   have left it out. -- Ed.

   [465] Scott quotes the following from Whitby, -- "If Paul, saith
   Estius, might desire the prayers of the Romans, why might not the
   Romans desire the prayers of Paul? I answer, they might desire his
   prayers, as he did theirs, by a letter directed to him to pray for
   them. He adds, If they might desire his prayers for them when living,
   why not when dead and reigning with Christ? I answer, Because they
   could direct no epistle to him, or in any other way acquaint him with
   their mind." -- Ed.

   [466] "Ut concertetis mihi," sunagonisasthai moi; "ut mecum certetis --
   that ye strive with me," -- Beza; "ut mecum laboretis -- that ye labor
   with me," -- Tremelius, from the Syriac. Literally it is, "that ye
   agonize with me." It is an allusion, says Grotius, to Jacob's wrestling
   with the angel. Genesis 32:24. A strenuous and earnest supplication is
   intended. Pareus says, that it is a metaphor taken from warfare, when a
   soldier comes to the help of another: but rather from the games, when
   there is a striving for the prize. He would have the Romans to make a
   similar strenuous effort for him in prayer to God. The word agon, is an
   agonistic and not a military term. -- Ed.

   [467] It was a mutual refreshment, according to Romans 1:12. The verb
   here used, says Grotius, means to give and to receive comfort. The verb
   without its compound sun, is found in 1 Corinthians 16:18; 2
   Corinthians 7:13; Philemon 1:7, etc. -- Ed.

   [468] Lover, author, or bestower of peace. This intimates that there
   were strifes and contentions among them. Paul often speaks of God as
   the God of peace, especially when referring to the discords which
   prevailed among Christians. See 1 Corinthians 14:33; 2 Corinthians
   13:11; Philippians 4:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 3:16;
   Hebrews 13:20. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [436] Introduced here, as the conclusion of the last chapter, by
   Griesbach and other collators of MSS., are the three last verses of the
   Epistle, 25-27. It appears that the largest number of copies is in
   favor of this arrangement, countenanced by the Greek fathers, and the
   Syriac and Arabic versions. In favor of the present order, as in our
   version, there are some good MSS., the Latin fathers, and the Vulgate,
   etc. What strongly favors and decidedly confirms the order which we
   have, is the evident connection as to matter between this and the last
   chapter, which shows the impropriety of having those verses intervening
   between them. -- Ed.

   Romans 16:1-16

   1. I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, which is a servant of the
   church which is at Cenchrea:

   1. Commendo antera vobis Phoeben sororem nostram, quae est ministra
   ecclesiae Cenchreensis;

   2. That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye
   assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath
   been a succourer of many, and of myself also.

   15. Salutate Philologum et Iuluiam, Nereum et sororem ejus, et Olympam,
   et qui cum his sunt omnes sanctos.

   16. Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute
   you.

   16. Salutate vos invicem in osculo sancto. Salutant vos ecelesiae
   Christi.

   1. I commend to you, etc. The greater part of this chapter is taken up
   with salutations; and as they contain no difficulties, it would be
   useless to dwell long on them. I shall only touch on those things which
   require some light by an explanation.

   He first commends to them Phoebe, to whom he gave this Epistle to be
   brought to them; and, in the first place, he commends her on account of
   her office, for she performed a most honorable and a most holy function
   in the Church; and then he adduces another reason why they ought to
   receive her and to show her every kindness, for she had always been a
   helper to all the godly. As then she was an assistant [469] of the
   Cenchrean Church, he bids that on that account she should be received
   in the Lord; and by adding as it is meet for saints, he intimates that
   it would be unbecoming the servants of Christ not to show her honor and
   kindness. And since it behooves us to embrace in love all the members
   of Christ, we ought surely to regard and especially to love and honor
   those who perform a public office in the Church. And besides, as she
   had always been full of kindness to all, so he bids that help and
   assistance should now be given to her in all her concerns; for it is
   what courtesy requires, that he who is naturally disposed to kindness
   should not be forsaken when in need of aid, and to incline their minds
   the more, he numbers himself among those whom she had assisted.

   But this service, of which he speaks as to what it was, he teaches us
   in another place, in 1 Timothy 5:9, for as the poor were supported from
   the public treasury of the Church, so they were taken care of by those
   in public offices, and for this charge widows were chosen, who being
   free from domestic concerns, and cumbered by no children, wished to
   consecrate themselves wholly to God by religious duties, they were
   therefore received into this office as those who had wholly given up
   themselves, and became bound to their charge in a manner like him, who
   having hired out his own labors, ceases to be free and to be his own
   master. Hence the Apostle accuses them of having violated their faith,
   who renounced the office which they had once undertaken, and as it
   behooved them to live in widowhood, he forbade them to be chosen under
   sixty years of age, (1 Timothy 5:9,11,) because he foresaw that under
   that age the vow of perpetual celibacy was dangerous, yea, liable to
   prove ruinous. This most sacred function, and very useful to the
   Church, when the state of things had become worse, degenerated into the
   idle order of Nuns; which, though corrupt at its beginning, and
   contrary to the word of God, has yet so fallen away from what it was at
   its commencement, that there is no difference between some of the
   sanctuaries of chastity and a common brothel.

   3. Salute Prisca [470] and Aquila The testimonies which he brings here
   in favor of some individuals, were partly intended for this end, that
   by honoring those who were faithful and worthy, faithfulness itself
   might be honored, and that they who could and would do more good than
   others, might have authority; and partly that they themselves might
   study to act in a manner corresponding to their past life, and not fail
   in their religious course, nor ever grow languid in their pious ardor.

   It is a singular honor which he ascribes here to Prisca and Aquila,
   especially with regard to a woman. The modesty of the holy man does on
   this account more clearly shine forth; for he disdained not to have a
   woman as his associate in the work of the Lord; nor was he ashamed to
   confess this. She was the wife of Aquila, and Luke calls her Priscilla.
   (Acts 18:2.) [471]

   4. To whom not only I, etc. As Prisca and Aquila had not spared their
   life for preserving the life of Paul, he testifies that he himself was
   individually thankful to them: he however adds, that thanks were given
   them by all the Churches of Christ; and he added this that he might, by
   such an example, influence the Romans. And deservedly dear and precious
   to all the Gentiles was the life of such a man, as it was an
   incomparable treasure: it was therefore no wonder that all the Churches
   of the Gentiles thought themselves to be under obligations to his
   preservers. [472]

   What he adds respecting the Church in their house is worthy of being
   observed; for he could not have more splendidly adorned their household
   than by giving it the title of a Church. The word congregation, which
   Erasmus has adopted, I do not approve; for it is plainly evident, that
   Paul, by way of honor, had used the sacred name of Church. [473]

   5. Who is the first-fruit, etc. This is an allusion to the rites of the
   law; for as men are sanctified to God by faith, they who first offer
   themselves are fitly called the first-fruit. Whosoever then is called
   first in time to the faith, Paul allows him the prerogative of honor:
   yet he retains this eminence only when the end corresponds with the
   beginning. And doubtless it is no common honor when God chooses some
   for first-fruits: and there is in addition a greater and an ampler
   trial of faith, through a longer space of time, provided they who have
   first begun are not wearied in their course. [474]

   6. He again testifies his gratitude, in recording the kindness of Mary
   to him. Nor is there any doubt but that he commemorates these praises,
   in order to recommend those whom he praised to the Romans. [475]

   7. Salute Andronicus Though Paul is not wont to make much of kindred,
   and of other things belonging to the flesh, yet as the relationship
   which Junia and Andronicus bore to him, might avail somewhat to make
   them more fully known, he neglected not this commendation. There is
   more weight in the second eulogy, when he calls them his
   fellow-prisoners; [476] for among the honors belonging to the warfare
   of Christ, bonds are not to be counted the least. In the third place,
   he calls them Apostles: he uses not this word in its proper and common
   meaning, but extends it wider, even to all those who not only teach in
   one Church, but also spend their labor in promulgating the gospel
   everywhere. He then, in a general way, calls those in this place
   Apostles, who planted Churches by carrying here and there the doctrine
   of salvation; for elsewhere he confines this title to that first order
   which Christ at the beginning established, when he appointed the twelve
   disciples. It would have been otherwise strange, that this dignity
   should be only ascribed to them, and to a few others. But as they had
   embraced the gospel by faith before Paul, he hesitates not to set them
   on this account before himself. [477]

   11. Who are of the family of Narcissus It would have been unbecoming to
   have passed by Peter in so long a catalogue, if he was then at Rome:
   yet he must have been there, if we believe the Romanists. But since in
   doubtful things nothing is better than to follow probable conjecture,
   no one, who judges impartially, will be persuaded that what they affirm
   is true; for he could not surely have been omitted by Paul.

   It is further to be noticed, that we hear nothing here of splendid and
   magnificent titles, by which we might conclude that men high in rank
   were Christians; for all those whom Paul mentions were the obscure and
   the ignoble at Rome. Narcissus, whom he here names, was, I think, the
   freeman of Claudius, a man notorious for many crimes and vices. The
   more wonderful was the goodness of God, which penetrated into that
   impure house, abounding in all kinds of wickedness; not that Narcissus
   himself had been converted to Christ, but it was a great thing that a
   house, which was like hell, should be visited by the grace of Christ.
   And as they, who lived under a foul pander, the most voracious robber,
   and the most corrupt of men, worshipped Christ in purity, there is no
   reason that servants should wait for their masters, but every one ought
   to follow Christ for himself. Yea, the exception added by Paul shows
   that the family was divided, so that the faithful were only a few.

   16. Salute one another with a holy kiss It is clear from many parts of
   Scripture, that a kiss was a usual and common symbol of friendship
   among the Jews; it was perhaps less used by the Romans, though not
   unfrequent, only it was not lawful to kiss women, except those only who
   were relatives. It became however a custom among the ancients for
   Christians to kiss one another before partaking of the Supper, to
   testify by that sign their friendship; and then they bestowed their
   alms, that they might in reality and by the effect confirm what they
   had represented by the kiss: all this appears evident from one of the
   homilies of Chrysostom [478] Hence has arisen that practice among the
   Papists at this day, of kissing the paten, and of bestowing an
   offering: the former of which is nothing but superstition without any
   benefit, the other serves no other purpose but to satisfy the
   avariciousness of the priests, if indeed it can be satisfied.

   Paul however seems not here positively to have enjoined a ceremony, but
   only exhorts them to cherish brotherly love; and he distinguishes it
   from the profane friendships of the world, which, for the most part,
   are either disguised or attained by vices, or retained by wicked arts,
   and never tend to any good. By sending salutations from the Churches,
   [479] he was endeavoring, as much as he could, to bind all the members
   of Christ by the mutual bond of love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [469] "Ministra," diakonos -- minister, or servant, or deaconess, one
   who ministers. Origen and Chrysostom considered her to be a deaconess,
   but the word does not necessarily prove this; for it is used often to
   designate generally one who does service and contributes to the help
   and assistance of others. She was evidently a person of wealth and
   influence, and was no doubt a great support and help to the Cenchrean
   Church. Those spoken of by Paul in 1 Timothy 5:10, and Titus 2:3, were
   widows and aged, and they are not called hai diakonoi, deaconesses.
   There arose, as it appears, an order of this kind in the early Church,
   and Grotius says that they were ordained by imposition of hands before
   the Laodicean Council, which forbade the practice. Their office was,
   according to Bingham and Suicer, referred to by Schleusner, to baptize
   women, to teach female catechumens, to visit the sick, and to perform
   other inferior offices in the Church. But this was the state of things
   after the apostolic times, and there is no reason to believe that
   Phoebe was of this order. She was evidently a great helper of the
   Christian cause, as some other women also are mentioned in this
   chapter, and she had been the helper of many, (Romans 16:2,) and not of
   one Church, and also of Paul himself; and from what is said in Romans
   16:2, it appears probable that she was a woman carrying on some
   business or traffic, and that she went to Rome partly at least on this
   account. -- Ed.

   [470] So reads Griesbach; it is the same with Priscilla. See Acts
   18:2,26, and 2 Timothy 4:19, where she is also called Prisca. Names in
   former times, as well as now, were sometimes used in a abbreviated
   form. -- Ed.

   [471] Whether Aquila was a laymen or not, the Apostle connects his wife
   with him in the work of cooperation with him in his ministerial work;
   and we see by Acts 18:26, that they both taught Apollos. It is somewhat
   singular, that the wife, not only here but in several other instances,
   though not in all, is mentioned before the husband. -- Ed.

   [472] The occasion is not mentioned. It was probably at Corinth,
   according to the account given in Acts 18.

   [473] Some of the Fathers considered that the family, being all
   religious, was the Church; but this is wholly inconsistent with the
   mode of expression that is used, and with the state of things at that
   time. They had no churches or temples to meet in; private houses were
   their churches. Superstitious ideas as to places of worship no doubt
   led men to seek such following, if he meant only the family, -- "Aquila
   and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with (sun -- together with)
   the Church that is in their house," 1 Corinthians 16:19. -- Ed.

   [474] Epaenetus, who is here called the first-fruit of Achaia, may have
   been off the family of Stephanas, who is said to have been the
   first-fruit in 1 Corinthians 16:15. But the majority of copies has
   Asia, Asias, here, instead of Achaia, Achaias. By Asia is often meant
   Asia Minor, and so here, no doubt, if it be the right reading. -- Ed.

   [475] It is said of Mary, that she "labored much," eis hemas, towards
   us, or among us; "inter nos -- among us," Beza; "pro nobis -- for us,"
   Grotius. The reading eis humas, towards you, has many MSS. in its
   favor, and also en humin, among you. -- Ed.

   [476] It is not certain to what the Apostle refers; for we have no
   particular account of him hitherto as a prisoner, except for a short
   time at Philippi, Acts 16:23-40; and it is probable, that it was on
   that occasion that they had been his fellow-prisoners; for it appears
   from the narrative, that there were more prisoners than Paul and Silas,
   as it is said that the "prisoners" heard them singing, Acts 16:25; and
   Paul's saying to the jailer, in Acts 16:28, "we are all here," clearly
   implies that he had some with him besides Silas. -- Ed.

   [477] The words episemoi en tois apostolois, noted among the Apostles,
   can hardly admit of a meaning different from what is here given, though
   some have explained the sense to be, that they were much esteemed by
   Apostles, or that they were "distinguished in the Apostles' judgment,"
   or that they were well known to the Apostles. But as "Apostles" in some
   other instances mean teachers, as Barnabas was, (Acts 14:14,) the
   explanation here given is most to be approved. -- Ed.

   [478] It appears from Justin Martyr and Tertullian, that the early
   Christians kissed one another always after prayers, or at the end of
   the service. They did so, says Grotius, to "show that they were all
   equal; for the Persians and the orientals kissed the mouth of those
   only of the same rank, and gave their hands to be kissed by their
   inferiors." It was evidently a custom among the Jews. See 2 Samuel
   20:9; Luke 7:45; Matthew 26:49. This "holy kiss" is mentioned in 1
   Corinthians 16:20; 2 Corinthians 13:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:26. It is
   called the kiss of love, or charity, by Peter, 1 Peter 5:14. It was one
   of those things which arose from peculiar habits, and is not be
   considered as binding on all nations, any more than the washing of
   feet. The Apostle's object seems to have been, not to enjoin a rite,
   but to regulate a practice, already existing, and to preserve it from
   abuse: it was to be a holy kiss. -- Ed.

   [479] Griesbach approves of tasai, "all," after Churches: then it would
   be "all the Churches;" that is, of Greece, says Grotius, but of
   Corinth, says Wolfius, even those which assembled at different private
   houses: and this is a more likely supposition, than that Paul,
   according to Origen and others, took it as granted that all the
   Churches which he had founded wished well to the Church of Rome. That
   they wished well to it there can be no doubt; but it is not probable
   that Paul acted on such a supposition. -- Ed.

   Romans 16:17-20

   17. Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
   offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid
   them.

   17. Obsecro autem vos fratres, ut observetis eos qui dissidia et
   offensiones contra doctrinam, quam vos didicistis, excitant; et ut
   declinetis ab illis.

   18. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their
   own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of
   the simple.

   18. Qui enim tales sunt, Christo Domino non serviunt, sed suo ventri;
   ac per blandiloquentiam et assentationem decipiunt corda simplicium.

   19. For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore
   on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good,
   and simple concerning evil.

   19. Vestra quidem obedientia ad omnes permanavit: gaudeo igitur de
   vobis; sed volo vos sapientes esse ad bonum, simplices vero ad malum.

   20. And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
   The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

   20. Deus autem pacis conteret brevi Satanam sub pedibus vestris. Gratia
   Domini nostri Iesu Christi sit vobiscum. Amen.

   17. And I beseech you, etc. He now adds an exhortation, by which all
   Churches have often need of being stirred up; for the ministers of
   Satan are ever ready to take occasion to disturb the kingdom of Christ:
   and they attempt to make disturbances in two ways; for they either sow
   discord, by which the minds of men are drawn away from the unity of
   truth, or they occasion offenses, by which men are alienated from the
   love of the gospel. [480] The former evil is done when the truth of God
   is mixed with new dogmas devised by men; and the latter takes place,
   when by various arts it is made odious and contemptible. He therefore
   bids all, who did either of these two things, to be observed, lest they
   should deceive and catch the unwary; and also to be shunned, for they
   were injurious. Nor was it without reason that he required this
   attention from the faithful; for it often happens through our neglect
   or want of care, that such wicked men do great harm to the Church,
   before they are opposed; and they also creep in, with astonishing
   subtlety, for the purpose of doing mischief, except they be carefully
   watched.

   But observe, that he speaks of those who had been taught the pure truth
   of God. It is indeed an impious and sacrilegious attempt to divide
   those who agree in the truth of Christ: but yet it is a shameful
   sophistry to defend, under the pretext of peace and unity, a union in
   lies and impious doctrines. There is therefore no ground for the
   Papists to seek countenance from this passage, in order to raise
   ill-will against us; for we do not impugn and tear asunder the gospel
   of Christ, but the falsehoods of the devil, by which it has been
   hitherto obscured: nay, Paul clearly shows, that he did not condemn all
   kinds of discords, but those which destroyed consent in the orthodox
   faith; for the force of the passage is in the words, which ye have
   learnt; for it was the duty of the Romans, before they were rightly
   taught, to depart from the habits of their fathers and the institutions
   of their ancestors.

   18. For they who are such, etc. He mentions an unvarying mark, by which
   false prophets are to be distinguished from the servants of Christ; for
   they have no care for the glory of Christ, but seek the benefit of
   their stomach. As, however, they deceitfully crept in, and by assuming
   another character, concealed their own wickedness, he at the same time
   pointed out, in order that no one might be deceived, the arts which
   they adopted -- that they ingratiated themselves by a bland address.
   The preachers of the gospel have also their courtesy and their pleasing
   manner, but joined with honesty, so that they neither soothe men with
   vain praises, nor flatter their vices: but impostors allure men by
   flattery, and spare and indulge their vices, that they may keep them
   attached to themselves. He calls those simple who are not cautious
   enough to avoid deceptions.

   19. Your obedience, [481] etc. This is said to anticipate an objection;
   for he shows that he did not warn them, as though he thought
   unfavorably of them, but because a fall in their case was such as might
   have easily happened; as if he had said, -- "Your obedience is indeed
   commended everywhere, and for this reason I rejoice on your account:
   yet since it often happens, that a fall occurs through simplicity, I
   would have you to be harmless and simple as to the doing of evil; but
   in doing good, to be most prudent, whenever it may be necessary, so
   that you may preserve your integrity."

   We here see what that simplicity is which is commended in Christians;
   so that they have no reason to claim this distinction, who at this day
   count as a high virtue their stupid ignorance of the word of God. For
   though he approves in the Romans, that they were obedient and
   teachable, yet he would have them to exercise wisdom and judgment, lest
   their readiness to believe exposed them to impositions. So then he
   congratulates them, because they were free from a wicked disposition;
   he yet wished them to be wise, so as to exercise caution. [482]

   20. What follows, God shall bruise Satan, etc., is a promise to confirm
   them, rather than a prayer. He indeed exhorts them to fight manfully
   against Satan, and promises that they should shortly be victorious. He
   was indeed once conquered by Christ, but not in such a way but that he
   renews the war continually. He then promises ultimate defeat, which
   does not appear in the midst of the contest. At the same time he does
   not speak only of the last day, when Satan shall be completely bruised;
   but as Satan was then confounding all things, raging, as it were, with
   loose or broken reins, he promises that the Lord would shortly subdue
   him, and cause him to be trodden, as it were, under foot. Immediately a
   prayer follows, -- that the grace of Christ would be with them, that
   is, that they might enjoy all the blessings which had been procured for
   them by Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [480] The two words are dichostasiai and skandala, divisions and
   offenses, or hindrances. He had, no doubt, in view, what he noticed in
   chapter 14, about eating and observing of days; and according to his
   usual manner he mentions first the effect -- "divisions," and then the
   cause -- "offenses." The Gentile Christians, by eating, gave offense to
   the believing Jews, and this offense led to a division or separation.
   The evils which he had previously attempted to correct were doubtless
   those referred to here. "Serving their own belly," in the next verse,
   has in this respect an emphatic meaning. Instead of denying themselves
   in the use of meats for the sake of Christ, and for the peace of his
   Church, they preferred to gratify their own appetites. And being led
   away by their lust, they covered their real motive by kindly or
   plausibly addressing (chrestologia) and eulogizing (eulogia) those who
   joined them, imitating in this respect the arts of all false professors
   and zealots, whatever be the false principle by which they may be
   guided. -- Ed.

   [481] This he calls "faith" in Romans 1:8: so that obedience to the
   gospel is faith in what it declares. To believe is the special command
   of the gospel: hence to believe is the special act of obedience that is
   required; and he who believes is he who shall be saved. But this faith
   is that of the heart, and not of the lips; and a faith which works by
   love and overcomes the world, the mighty power of which we learn from
   Hebrew 11. -- Ed.

   [482] "Good" and "evil" in this clause, is beneficence and mischief. To
   be wise as to good, is to be wise in acts of kindness, in promoting
   good, as Beza seems to take it; and to be harmless or guileless, or
   simple as to evil, is to exercise no arts, by plausible speeches and
   flatteries, as was done by those referred to in Romans 16:17, in order
   to do mischief, to create divisions. The Apostle's object throughout
   seems to have been to produce unanimity between the Jews and Gentiles.
   Hence in the next verse he speaks of God as "the God of peace," the
   author of peace among his people; and he says that this God of peace
   would soon tread down Satan, the author of discord, the promoter of
   divisions and offenses; or, as most consider the passage, he prays that
   God would do this; for the future, after the manner of the Hebrew, is
   sometimes used by the Apostle as an optative. And indeed the verb is
   found in some copies in this mood (suntripsai) and in the Syriac,
   Ethiopic, and Vulgate versions. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Romans 16:21-27

   21. Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my
   kinsmen, salute you.

   21. Salutant vos Timotheus, cooperarius meus, et Lucius et lason et
   Sosipater, cognati mei.

   22. I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

   22. Saluto ego vos Tertius, qui scripsi epistolam, in Domino.

   23. Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the
   chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.

   23. Salutat vos Gaius, hospes meus et Ecclesiae totius. Salutat vos
   Erastus, quaestor aerarius urbis, et Quartus frater.

   24. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

   24. Gratia Domini nostri Iesu Christi sit cure omnibus vobis. Amen.

   25. Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel,
   and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
   mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,

   25. Ei vero qui potens est vos confirmare secundum evangelium meum, et
   praeconium scilicet Iesu Christi, secundum revelationem mysterii, quod
   temporibus secularibus tacitum,

   26. But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets,
   according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all
   nations for the obedience of faith:

   26. Manifestatum nunc fuit, et per scripturas propheticas, secundum
   aeterni Dei ordinationem, in obedientiam fidei ad omnes gentes
   promulgatum, --

   27. To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.

   Written to the Romans from Corinthus, and sent by Phebe servant of the
   church at Cenchrea.

   27. Soli sapienti Deo per Iesum Christum gloria in secula. Amen.

   Ad Romanos missa fuit a Corinthe per Phoeben, ministram Cenchreensis
   ecclesiae.

   21. Timothy, etc. The salutations which he records, served in part to
   foster union between those who were far asunder, and in part to make
   the Romans know that their brethren subscribed to the Epistle; not that
   Paul had need of the testimony of others, but because the consent of
   the godly is not of small importance.

   The Epistle closes, as we see, with praise and thanksgiving to God. It
   indeed records the remarkable kindness of God in favoring the Gentiles
   with the light of the gospel, by which his infinite and unspeakable
   goodness has been made evident. The conclusion has, at the same time,
   this to recommend it, -- that it serves to raise up and strengthen the
   confidence of the godly, so that with hearts lifted up to God they may
   fully expect all those things which are here ascribed to him, and may
   also confirm their hope as to what is to come by considering his former
   benefits. [483] But as he has made a long period, by collecting many
   things into one passage, the different clauses, implicated by being
   transposed, must be considered apart.

   He ascribes first all the glory to God alone; and then, in order to
   show that it is rightly due to him, he by the way mentions some of his
   attributes; whence it appears that he alone is worthy of all praise. He
   says that he only is wise; which praise, being claimed for him alone,
   is taken away from all creatures. Paul, at the same time, after having
   spoken of the secret counsel of God, seems to have designedly annexed
   this eulogy, in order that he might draw all men to reverence and adore
   the wisdom of God: for we know how inclined men are to raise a clamor,
   when they can find out no reason for the works of God.

   By adding, that God was able to confirm the Romans, he made them more
   certain of their final perseverance. And that they might acquiesce more
   fully in his power, he adds, that a testimony is borne to it in the
   gospel. Here you see, that the gospel not only promises to us present
   grace, but also brings to us an assurance of that grace which is to
   endure for ever; for God declares in it that he is our Father, not only
   at present, but that he will be so to the end: nay, his adoption
   extends beyond death, for it will conduct us to an eternal inheritance.

   The other things are mentioned to commend the power and dignity of the
   gospel. He calls the gospel the preaching of Jesus Christ; inasmuch as
   the whole sum and substance of it is no doubt included in the knowledge
   of Christ. Its doctrine is the revelation of the mystery; and this its
   character ought not only to make us more attentive to hear it, but also
   to impress on our minds the highest veneration for it: and he intimates
   how sublime a secret it is, by adding that it was hid for many ages,
   from the beginning of the world. [484]

   It does not indeed contain a turgid and proud wisdom, such as the
   children of this world seek; and by whom it is held on this account in
   contempt: but it unfolds the ineffable treasures of celestial wisdom,
   much higher than all human learning; and since the very angels regard
   them with wonder, surely none of us can sufficiently admire them. But
   this wisdom ought not to be less esteemed, because it is conveyed in an
   humble, plain, and simple style; for thus it has pleased the Lord to
   bring down the arrogance of the flesh.

   And as it might have created some doubt how this mystery, concealed for
   so many ages, could have so suddenly emerged, he teaches us, that this
   has not happened through the hasty doings of men, or through chance,
   but through the eternal ordination of God. Here, also, he closes up the
   door against all those curious questions which the waywardness of the
   human mind is wont to raise; for whatever happens suddenly and
   unexpectedly, they think, happens at random; and hence they absurdly
   conclude, that the works of God are unreasonable; or at least they
   entangle themselves in many perplexing doubts. Paul therefore reminds
   us, that what appeared then suddenly had been decreed by God before the
   foundation of the world.

   But that no one might raise a dispute on the subject, and charge the
   gospel with being a new thing, and thus defame it, he refers to the
   prophetic Scriptures, in which we now see, that what is fulfilled had
   been foretold; for all the Prophets have rendered to the gospel so
   clear a testimony, that it can in no other way be so fully confirmed.
   And God thus duly prepared the minds of his people, lest the novelty of
   what they were not accustomed to should too much astonish them. [485]

   If any one objects and says, that there is an inconsistency in the
   words of Paul, because he says that the mystery, of which God had
   testified by his Prophets, was hid throughout all the ages; -- the
   solution of this knot is plainly given by Peter, -- that the Prophets,
   when they sedulously inquired of the salvation made known to us,
   ministered, not to themselves, but to us. (1 Peter 1:12.) God then was
   at that time silent, though he spoke; for he held in suspense the
   revelation of those things concerning which he designed that his
   servants should prophesy.

   Though it is not agreed among the learned in what sense he calls the
   gospel a hidden mystery in this place, and in Ephesians 3:9, and in
   Colossians 1:26; yet their opinion has most in its favor, who apply it
   to the calling of the Gentiles, to which Paul himself expressly refers
   in his Epistle to the Colossians. Now, though I allow this to be one
   reason, I yet cannot be brought to believe that it is the only reason.
   It seems to me more probable that Paul had also a regard to some other
   differences between the Old and the New Testament. For though the
   Prophets formerly taught all those things which have been explained by
   Christ and his Apostles, yet they taught them with so much obscurity,
   that in comparison with the clear brightness of gospel light, it is no
   wonder that those things are said to have been hidden which are now
   made manifest. Nor was it indeed to no purpose that Malachi declared
   that the Sun of righteousness would arise, (Malachi 4:2;) or that
   Isaiah had beforehand so highly eulogized the embassy of the Messiah.
   And lastly, it is not without reason that the gospel is called the
   kingdom of God: but we may conclude from the event itself, that then
   only were opened the treasures of celestial wisdom, when God appeared
   to his ancient people through his only-begotten Son, as it were face to
   face, all shadows having been done away. He again refers to the end,
   mentioned at the beginning of the first chapter, for which the gospel
   is to be preached, -- that God may lead all nations to the obedience of
   faith


   THE ONLY WISE GOD:

   AMEN.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [483] This conclusion bears an evident reference to the point the
   Apostle had especially in view -- the reconciling of the Jews and
   Gentiles. He connects the gospel with the ancient Scriptures, and
   mentions the gospel as being in unison with them. Then the Jews had no
   reason to complain. As in Romans 16:17 to 20 inclusive, he reproved the
   Gentiles who caused divisions; so in these verses his special object is
   to put an end to the objections of the Jews. -- Ed.

   [484] The words are chronois aioniois, rendered improperly by Hammond
   and others, from the eternal ages, or eternity. We find them preceded
   by pro before, in 2 Timothy 1:9, and in Titus 1:2: "before the eternal
   ages," could not be right rendering; nor is "before the world began,"
   as in our version, correct; for a reference in Titus is made to God's
   promise. "In the times of the ages" is the rendering of Deza and of
   Macknight; and, in "ancient times," is that of Doddridge and Stuart The
   same subject is handled in two other places, Ephesians 3:5, and
   Colossians 1:26: and the words used by him are "in other ages,"
   heterais geneais, and, "from ages and generations," apo ton aio'non kai
   apo ton geneon Theodoret explained the terms by anothen ---in past
   times; and Theophylact by palai--formerly; and Schleusner by a similar
   word, olim.--Ed.

   [485] This clause is differently construed: some connect "prophetic
   Scriptures" with "manifested," or made manifest. So Doddridqe and
   Stuart; but Beza, Pareus, and Macknight agree with Calvin, and connect
   the words with "made known" or proclaimed. The conjunctive te after dia
   favors this construction; and dia means here "by the means," or by the
   aid and sanction, "of the prophetic Scriptures." Then the meaning
   is--"that the mystery, hid for ages, is now manifest, that is, by the
   gospel, and by means of the prophetic Scriptures, and consistently with
   the decree (epitagen) or ordination of the eternal God, is made known
   to all nations for the obedience of faith." According to this view is
   the exposition of Calvin, which is no doubt correct. But it is more
   consistent with the tenor of the latter part of this epistle, and with
   the other passages, such as Ephesians 3:4-6, and Colossians 1:26, 27,
   where he mentions the same mystery, to consider the reference here to
   be exclusively to the union of Jews and Gentiles, and not generally to
   the gospel, as Calvin and others have thought. There is a grammatical
   difficulty in the last verse: the relative o is found before "glory."
   Beza and others considered it redundant. The verse is literally as
   follows,-- 27. To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be
   the glory for ever. Amen. It is omitted in a few copies; several copies
   have auto, which would read better: but its genuineness is rejected by
   Griesbach and others. The ascription of praise is evidently given to
   God, as one who has contrived and arranged his dispensation of grace
   and mercy: and his wisdom here refers to the same thing, as in Romans
   11:33. However mysterious may his dispensation appear to us with regard
   to the Jews and Gentiles, in leaving the latter for so long a time in
   ignorance, in favoring the former only in the first instance with a
   revelation of himself, and then in showing favor to the Gentiles, and
   in rejecting the Jews for a time, and afterwards restoring them --
   however mysterious all these things may appear, the Apostle assures us
   that they are the arrangements of the only wise God. -- Ed.

   CALVIN'S VERSION OF

   THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called Apostle, chosen for the
   gospel of God,

   2 Which he had before promised by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures,

   3 Concerning his Son, who came from the seed of David according to the
   flesh;

   4 Declared the Son of' God in power, through the Spirit of holiness, by
   the resurrection from the dead, even Jesus Christ our Lord;

   5 Through whom we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience
   of faith among all nations, for his name's sake;

   6 Among whom ye are also the called of Jesus Christ;

   7 To all of you who are at Rome, beloved by God, called saints: grace
   to you, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

   8 First indeed I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you
   all, because your faith is proclaimed through the whole world.

   9 For my witness is God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of
   his Son, that I continually make mention of you, in all my prayers,

   10 Requesting that by some means a prosperous journey may some time be
   given me, through God's will, to come to you:

   11 For I desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual
   gift to confirm you;

   12 That is, that we may mutually partake of encouragement through
   mutual faith, even yours and mine.

   13 And I would not that you should not know, brethren, that I have
   often proposed to come to you, (and have been hitherto hindered,) that
   I might have some fruit among you as also among other nations.

   14 Both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to
   the foolish, am I a debtor;

   15 So that, as far as I can, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
   also who are at Rome;

   16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, since it is the power
   of God for salvation to every one who believes, to the Jew first, then
   to the Greek;

   17 For the righteousness of God is in it revealed from faith to faith,
   as it is written, "The just by his faith shall live."

   18 Revealed also is the wrath of God from heaven, against all the
   impiety and injustice of men, who unjustly suppress the truth of God;

   19 Because what may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God has
   manifested it to them;

   20 Since his invisible things are seen from the creation of the world,
   being understood by his works, even his eternal power and divinity, so
   that they are inexcusable;

   21 inasmuch as when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, nor
   were thankful; but became vain in their thoughts, and darkened was
   their foolish heart:

   22 When they thought themselves wise, they became fools,

   23 And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of
   an image, into that of a corruptible man and of birds and of quadrupeds
   and of reptiles.

   24 Therefore God gave them up to the lusts of their own hearts for
   uncleanness, that they might degrade their bodies among themselves,

   25 Who had transformed the truth respecting God into falsehood, and
   worshipped and adored the creature above the Creator; who is blessed
   for ever; Amen

   26 Therefore, I say, God gave them up to disgraceful passions; for
   their women turned the natural habit into that which is contrary to
   nature;

   27 And in like manner the men also, having left off the natural use of
   the woman, burned with mutual lust, one towards another, males working
   filthiness with males, and receiving in themselves the reward due to
   them for their going astray.

   28 And as they chose not to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them
   up to a reprobate mind, to do things not becoming;

   29 That they might be full of all unrighteousness, wickedness, lust,
   avarice, malignity, being filled with envy, murder, strife, guile,
   perversity, being whisperers,

   30 Calumniators, haters of God, villaneus, disdainful, haughty,
   inventors of evils, disobedient to parents,

   31 Without understanding, insociable, void of natural affections,
   truce-breakers, merciless;

   32 Who, when they knew the judgment of God, that they who do such
   things are worthy of death, not only do them, but approve of those who
   do them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 Therefore inexcusable art thou, O man, who judgest; for in what thou
   judgest another, thou condemnest thyself, for the same things doest
   thou who judgest.

   2 Now we know that God's judgment is according to truth on those who do
   such things.

   3 And thinkest thou, O man, who judgest those who do such things and
   doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?

   4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
   gentleness, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to
   repentance?

   5 But according to thy hardness and a heart that cannot repent, thou
   treasurest for thyself wrath for the day of wrath and of the revelation
   of the righteous judgment of God;

   6 Who will render to every one according to his works, --

   7 To those indeed, who by perseverance in doing good, seek glory and
   honor and immortality, eternal life;

   8 But to those who are contentious and disobedient to the truth and
   obey unrighteousness, there shall be indignation and wrath,

   9 Tribulation and anguish shall be on every soul of man who doeth evil,
   the Jew first, then the Greek;

   10 But glory and honor and peace shall be to every one who works good,
   to the Jew first, then to the Greek;

   11 Since there is no respect of persons with God.

   12 For whosoever have without the law sinned, shall also without the
   law perish; but whosoever have under the law sinned, shall by the law
   be judged,

   13 For not the hearers of the law are just before God; but they who do
   the law shall be justified.

   14 When indeed the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the
   things of the law, they, having not the law, are a law to themselves;

   15 Who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their
   conscience at the same time attesting, and their thoughts accusing or
   excusing each other,

   16 In the day in which God will judge the secrets of men, according to
   my gospel, through Jesus Christ.

   17 Behold, thou art named a Jew, and restest in the law and gloriest in
   God,

   18 And knowest his will and approvest of things excellent, being
   instructed from the law,

   19 And art confident that thou thyself art a leader to the blind, a
   light to those who are in darkness,

   20 An instructor to the foolish, a teacher to the ignorant, because
   thou hast the form of knowledge and of' the truth according to the law:

   21 Yet thou who teachest another, dost not teach thyself; thou who
   preachest "steal not," stealest;

   22 Thou who sayest, "commit no adultery," committest adultery; thou who
   hatest idols, committest sacrilege;

   23 Thou who gloriest in the law, by transgressing the law dishonorest
   God; for the name of God,

   24 As it is written, is reproached on your account among the nations.

   25 For circumcision indeed profits, if thou keep the law; but if thou
   be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is turned into
   uncircumcision.

   26 If then the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall
   not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

   27 And shall not he who is by nature uncircumcision judge thee, (if he
   keep the law,) who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of
   the law?

   28 For not he who is a Jew openly, is a Jew; nor is that circumcision
   which is openly in the flesh:

   29 But he who is one in secret is a Jew; and circumcision is that of
   the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; the praise of whom is not
   from men, but from God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 3

   1 What then is the privilege of the Jew, or what is the benefit of
   circumcision?

   2 Much in every way; and first indeed, because to them have been
   intrusted the oracles of God.

   3 What indeed if some have not believed? Shall their unbelief render
   void the faithfulness of God?

   4 By no means; but let God be true, and every man false, as it is
   written, "That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and overcome
   when thou art judged."

   5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
   shall we say? Is God unjust who executes wrath? (according to man I
   speak:)

   6 By no means; for how then shall God judge the world?

   7 If indeed the truth of God has through my falsehood redounded to his
   glory, why still am even I judged as a sinner, --

   8 And why not (as we are reproached, and as some declare that we say)
   "Let us do evils, that good things may come?" the judgment of whom is
   just.

   9 What then? do we excel? Not at all; for we have before brought a
   charge against both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;

   10 As it is written, "There is none righteous, not indeed one;

   11 There is none who understands, There is none who seeks God;

   12 All have turned aside; they have become together unprofitable; there
   is none who doeth kindness, no, not even one:

   13 An open grave is their throat; with their tongues have they dealt
   deceitfully: The poison of asps is under their lips:

   14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

   15 Swift are their feet to shed blood;

   16 Ruin and misery are in their ways;

   17 And the way of peace have they not known:

   18 There is no fear of God before their eyes."

   19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are
   under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may
   become guilty before God:

   20 Because no flesh shall by the works of the law be justified before
   him, since by the law is the knowledge of sin.

   21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
   being approved by the law and the Prophets, --

   22 Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, which
   is to all and upon all who believe: there is indeed no difference;

   23 For all have sinned, and are become destitute of the glory of God;

   24 And they are justified gratuitously by his grace through the
   redemption which is in Christ Jesus;

   25 Whom God has set forth as a propitiatory through faith in his blood,
   for a demonstration of his righteousness on account of the remission of
   sins, which before existed through the forbearance of God, --

   26 For a demonstration of his righteousness, at this time, that he
   might be just. and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.

   27 Where then is glorying? It is excluded: by what law? Of works? no;
   but by the law of faith.

   28 We then conclude, that by faith is man justified without the works
   of the law.

   29 Is he the God of the Jews only? and not also of the Gentiles? Yes,
   of the Gentiles also;

   30 Since one is God, who will justify the circumcision by faith and the
   uncircumcision through faith.

   31 Do we then make void the law by faith? By no means; but we confirm
   the law.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 4

   1 What shall we then say, that Abraham, our father according to the
   flesh, had obtained?

   2 For if Abraham was by works justified, he has what he may glory in,
   but not before God.

   3 But what saith the Scripture? "Abraham believed God, and it was
   imputed to him for righteousness."

   4 To him indeed who works the reward is not imputed as a grace, but as
   a debt:

   5 But to him who works not, but believes on him who justifies the
   ungodly, imputed is his faith for righteousness.

   6 As David also describes the blessedness of the man, to whom God
   imputes righteousness without works,

   7 "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are
   covered;

   8 Blessed is the man to whom God has not imputed sin."

   9 Was then this blessedness on the circumcision only, or also on the
   uncircumcision? for we say, that imputed to Abraham was faith for
   righteousness:

   10 How then was it imputed? when he was in circumcision, or in
   uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;

   11 And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the
   righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision, that he
   might be the father of all who believe while in uncircumcision, in
   order that to them also righteousness might be imputed, --

   12 And the father of the circumcision, not to those who are in
   circumcision only, but who walk in the footsteps of that faith which
   our father Abraham had in uncircumcision.

   13 It was not indeed by the law that the promise was to Abraham and to
   his seed, that he should be the heir of the world, but through the
   righteousness of faith.

   14 For if they who are of the law are heirs, then made void is faith,
   and abolished is the promise.

   15 For the law causeth wrath: but where no law is, there is also no
   transgression.

   16 It is therefore by faith, that it might be through grace, in order
   that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which
   is of the law, but which also is of the faith of Abraham, who is the
   father of us all,

   17 (As it is written, "The father of many nations have I made thee,")
   before God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls things
   which are not, as though they were:

   18 Who against hope believed through hope, that he would be the father
   of many nations, according to what had been said, "So shall thy seed
   be."

   19 And being not in faith weak, he considered not his own body, now
   dead, when he was nearly an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of
   Sarah;

   20 Nor did he indeed search into the promise of God through unbelief,
   but was strengthened by faith, giving glory to God;

   21 And being assuredly persuaded, that what he had promised he was also
   able to perform:

   22 And it was therefore imputed to him for righteousness.

   23 Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed to
   him

   24 But also on our account, to whom it shall be imputed, even to us who
   believe on him, who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead;

   25 Who was delivered for our offenses and raised for our justification.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Being then justified, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ;

   2 Through whom we have had access by faith to this grace in which we
   stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of God:

   3 And not only so, but we glory also in tribulations; knowing that
   tribulation produces patience;

   4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:

   5 Moreover, hope makes us not ashamed, because the love of God is
   diffused in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.

   6 For Christ, when we were as yet as to time weak, died for the
   ungodly.

   7 Hardly indeed for the just will any one die; but for the good perhaps
   some one may even venture to die:

   8 But God confirms his love towards us, because when we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us.

   9 Much more then, having been now justified by his blood, shall we be
   saved by him from wrath.

   10 If indeed when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved
   through his life:

   11 And not only so, but we also glory in God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

   12 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and through sin
   death; and so over all men has death spread, since all have sinned;

   13 (For until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when
   there is no law.

   14 Yet reign did sin from Adam to Moses, even over them who had not
   sinned after the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is the
   figure of him that was to come.

   15 But not as the offense, so also the gift: for if through the offense
   of one many died, much more has the grace of God, and the gift of God
   through grace, abounded unto many.

   16 And not as through one who had sinned, so the gift; for judgment was
   from one offense to condemnation, but the gift is from many offenses
   unto justification.

   17 For if by the offense of one death reigned through one, much more
   shall they who have received abundance of grace, and the gift of
   righteousness, reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.)

   18 Therefore as through the offense of one judgment came on all men to
   condemnation, so also through the justification of one, the gift comes
   to all men to the justification of life:

   19 For as through the disobedience of one man many were made sinners,
   so also through the obedience of one many shall be made righteous.

   20 But the law intervened, that the offense might abound: but where sin
   abounded, grace has superabounded;

   21 That as sin has reigned through death, so grace also might reign
   through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 6

   1 What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin that grace may
   abound

   2 By no means: we who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?

   3 Know ye not, that we all, who have been baptized into Jesus Christ,
   have been baptized into his death?

   4 Buried then have we been with him through baptism unto death, that as
   Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also
   should walk in newness of life:

   5 For if we have been ingrafted in the likeness of his death, doubtless
   we shall also be partakers of his resurrection;

   6 Knowing this, that our old man was crucified, together with him, that
   abolished might be the body of sin, so that we may no longer serve sin:

   7 For he who has died, has been freed from sin.

   8 Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
   with him;

   9 Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more,
   death no more reigns over him:

   10 For that he died, he once for sin died; and that he lives, he lives
   to God.

   11 So also regard ye yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to
   God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   12 Let not sin then reign in your mortal body, so as to obey it. in its
   lusts.

   13 Neither present your members, as weapons of unrighteousness, to sin;
   but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your
   members, as weapons of righteousness, to God:

   14 For sin shall not rule over you, since ye are not under the law, but
   under grace.

   15 What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under
   grace? By no means:

   16 Know ye not that to whom ye present yourselves servants for
   obedience, ye are the servants of him whom ye obey, whether of sin for
   death, or of obedience for righteousness?

   17 But thanks to God; for ye have been the servants of sin, but ye have
   obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine into which you were
   delivered;

   18 And having been freed from sin, ye became the servants of
   righteousness.

   19 I speak what is human on account of the infirmity of your flesh: As
   ye have presented your members to uncleanness and to iniquity for
   iniquity, so also now present your members servants to righteousness
   for holiness:

   20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
   righteousness.

   21 What fruit therefore had you then in those things, of which ye are
   now ashamed? for their end is death;

   22 But now, having been freed from sin and made servants to God, ye
   have your fruit, holiness, and your end, eternal life:

   23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
   in Christ Jesus our Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 7

   1 Know ye not, brethren, (for to those who know the law I speak,) that
   the law rules over a man as long as he lives.

   2 For a woman, subject to a husband, is bound by the law to a living
   husband: but if the husband die, she is loosed from the law of her
   husband.

   3 While then the husband is living, she shall be called an adulteress,
   if she be united to another man: but if the husband be dead, she is
   freed from his law, so that she is not an adulteress by marrying
   another man.

   4 And thus, my brethren, are ye also dead to the law through the body
   of Christ, that hereafter ye should be united to another, even to him
   who has been raised from the dead, that ye might bring forth fruit to
   God.

   5 For when ye were in the flesh, the emotions of sin which are through
   the law wrought in your members to bring forth fruit to death:

   6 But now ye are loosed from the law, having died to that by which we
   were held, that we might serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
   oldness of the letter.

   7 What then shall we say? Is the law sin? By no means: yet sin I knew
   not except through the law; for concupiscence I had not known, had not
   the law said, "Thou shalt not lust."

   8 And the occasion being taken, sin through the commandment wrought in
   me every concupiscence. Sin indeed without the law is dead:

   9 And I lived some time without the law; but when the commandment came,
   sin revived, and I died;

   10 And the commandment, which was for life, was found by me to be unto
   death:

   11 For sin taking occasion through the commandment, led me astray, and
   through it slew me.

   12 So then the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy and just
   and good.

   13 Did then what is good become death to me? By no means: but sin, that
   it might appear to be sin, wrought death in me through that which is
   good, in order that sin through the commandment might become above
   measure sinful.

   14 We indeed know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold
   under sin:

   15 For what I work I know not; since what I would, this I do not, but
   what I hate, this I do.

   16 If then, what I would not, this I do, I consent to the law of God,
   that it is good:

   17 And now, it is no longer I who do it, but sin which dwells in me.
   [486]

   18 I indeed know that no good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for
   to will is present with me, but to perform what is good I find not;

   19 Since the good I would I do not; but the evil I would not, that I
   do.

   20 But if what I would not, that I do, it is no longer I who do it, but
   sin which dwells in me.

   21 I find then a law that while I am willing to do good, evil lies in
   wait for me.

   22 I consent then to the law of God according to the inner-man:

   23 But I see another law in my members, resisting the law of my mind
   and making me captive to the law of sin which is in my members.

   24 Miserable man am I! who shall rescue me from this body of death?

   25 I give thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord: so then with the
   mind I serve myself the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [486] Here is repeated in a different way what had been before stated,
   only the reference before was to the weakness of good, but here to the
   power of evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 8

   1 There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

   2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free
   from the law of sin and of death:

   3 For it being impossible for the law, because it was weak through the
   flesh, God, having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
   even by a sin-offering condemned sin in the flesh;

   4 That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
   not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

   5 For they who are after the flesh, think of the things of the flesh;
   but they who are after the Spirit, of the things of the Spirit.

   6 Doubtless the thinking of the flesh is death; but the thinking of the
   Spirit is life and peace:

   7 Because the thinking of the flesh is enmity against God; for to the
   law of God it is not subject, nor can it be;

   8 They therefore who are in the flesh, cannot please God.

   9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit
   of God dwells in you; but if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he
   is not his.

   10 But if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead with respect to
   sin, but the spirit is life with regard to righteousness.

   11 If then the Spirit of him, who raised Jesus from the dead, dwells in
   you, he who raised Christ from the dead will quicken your mortal bodies
   through his Spirit who dwells in you.

   12 So then, brethren, debtors we are, not to the flesh, that we may
   live after the flesh;

   13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if by the Spirit
   ye mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live:

   14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of
   God.

   15 Ye have not indeed received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
   ye have received the spirit of adoption, through whom we cry, Abba,
   Father:

   16 The very Spirit itself testifies together with our spirit, that we
   are the sons of God:

   17 And if sons, then heirs; the heirs of God, and co-heirs with Christ;
   if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together.

   18 I indeed judge, that the afflictions of this time are not to be
   compared to the future glory which shall be revealed to us.

   19 For the intent expectation of the creation waits for the revelation
   of the sons of God;

   20 For to vanity has the creation been subjected, not willingly, but on
   account of him who has subjected it in hope;

   21 Because the creation itself shall also be reclaimed from the bondage
   of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God;

   22 For we know that the whole creation groans and labors in pain to
   this day:

   23 And not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the beginnings of
   the Spirit, even we ourselves do groan in ourselves, waiting for our
   adoption, the redemption of our body;

   24 For by hope are we saved but hope that is seen is not hope; for what
   one sees, how can he hope for it?

   25 If then for what we see not we hope, we wait for it in patience.
   [487]

   26 And in like manner the Spirit also assists our infirmities; for what
   to pray for as we ought we know not; but the Spirit himself intercedes
   for us with groanings unutterable:

   27 And he who searches the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit; because
   he intercedes according to God's will for the saints.

   28 We further know, that to those who love God all things co-operate
   for good, even to those who are called according to his purpose:

   29 For whom he has foreknown, he has also predetermined to be conformed
   to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many
   brethren;

   30 And whom he has predetermined, them has he also called; and whom he
   has called, them has he also justified; and whom he has justified, them
   has he also glorified.

   31 What then shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
   against us?

   32 He who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

   33 Who shall bring an accusation against the elect of God? God is he
   who justifies

   34 Who is he who condemns? Christ is he who died; nay, rather who has
   been raised, who also is at the right hand of the Father, and who
   intercedes for us.

   35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation, or
   distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

   36 As it is written, "For thee we die daily, we are counted as sheep
   destined for the slaughter:"

   37 But in all these things we do more than overcome through him who has
   loved us.

   38 For I am persuaded, that neither death nor life, neither angels nor
   principalities nor powers, neither things present nor things future,

   39 Neither height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able
   to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [487] To exhibit the meaning of this passage according to what is
   advanced in a note [7]in pp. 306, 307, it shall be presented here in
   lines, -- 19. Truly the intent expectation of the creature
   Waits for the revelation of the sons of God; 20. For to vanity has the
   creature been subjected, not willingly,
   But on his account who has subjected it in hope; 21. For even the
   creature itself shall be freed from the bondage of corruption,
   Into the glorious liberty of the sons of God; 22. For we know that
   every creature groans together,
   And together travails in pain to this day: 23. And not only they, but
   we also ourselves,
   Who possess the first-fruit of the Spirit,
   Even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
   Anxiously waiting for our adoption,
   The redemption of our body; 24. For in hope are we saved,
   But hope seen is not hope;
   For what one sees, why does he yet hope for it? 25. But if what we see
   not, we hope for,
   We wait for it in patience. We may indeed consider "every creature" in
   verse 22 as referring to every renewed creature then living, (except
   the Apostles and those endowed with the extraordinary gifts of the
   Spirit,) and all such from the beginning of the world. In this case,
   "to this day" has a striking import. All God's servants from the
   beginning had been groaning under the body of sin, and not only they,
   but even those who had enjoyed the first outpouring of the Spirit, and
   had been endued with extraordinary gifts. The gifts of the Spirit,
   however abundant, did not free any from the bondage of corruption, from
   the body of sin; but this was an object of hope, for which they were to
   wait. The context, before and after, clearly shows that the present
   condition of God's people is the subject. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 9

   1 The truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me a
   testimony together with the Holy Spirit,

   2 That I have a great grief and a continual sorrow in my heart;

   3 For I myself could wish to be an anathema from Christ for my
   brethren, my kindred according to the flesh;

   4 Who are Israelites, whose are the adoption and the glory and the
   covenants and the lawgiving and the worship and the promises;

   5 Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ according to the
   flesh, who is above all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

   6 Not however as though God's word has failed; for not all who are from
   Israel are Israelites;

   7 Nor are they who are the seed of Abraham, on this account all sons;
   but, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called;"

   8 That is, They who are the sons of the flesh, are not the sons of God;
   but they who are the sons of the promise shall be counted for a seed.

   9 For the word of promise is this, "According to this time shall I
   come, and there shall be a son to Sarah."

   10 And not only he, but Rebecca also, who had conceived by one, our
   father Isaac;

   11 For when the children were not yet born, and had done neither good
   nor evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand,
   not by works, but through him who calls,

   12 It was said to her, "The elder shall serve the younger;"

   13 According to what is written, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
   hated."

   14 What then shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? By no
   means:

   15 For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
   and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."

   16 It is not then of him who wills, nor of him who runs; but of God who
   shows mercy.

   17 For the Scripture saith to Pharaoh, "For this have I raised thee,
   that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be
   proclaimed through the whole earth."

   18 So then on whom he wills he has mercy, and whom he wills he hardens.

   19 Thou wilt then say to me, Why does he still blame? His will, who has
   resisted it?

   20 But, O man, who art thou who contendest in judgment with God? Does
   the earthen vessel say to the potter, Why hast thou thus made me?

   21 Has not the former of the clay power, from the same mass, to make
   one vessel to honor, another to dishonor?

   22 And what if God, willing to show his wrath and to make known his
   power, has endured with much patience the vessels of wrath, prepared
   for destruction;

   23 That he might also make known the riches of his grace towards the
   vessels of mercy, which he has foreprepared for glory?

   24 Whom he has also called, even us, not only from the Jews, but also
   from the Gentiles;

   25 As he says in Hosea, "I will call them my people, who is not a
   people, and her beloved, who is not beloved:

   26 And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, Not my
   people are ye;' there shall they be called the sons of the living God:"

   27 And Isaiah exclaims respecting Israel, "Though the number of the
   sons of Israel should be as the sand of the sea, yet only a remnant
   shall be saved;

   28 For the work he will finish and shorten, because a shortened work
   will the Lord do on the earth;"

   29 As Isaiah had also said before, "Except the Lord of hosts had left
   us a seed, we should have been as Sodom and made like to Gomorrha."

   30 What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not follow after
   righteousness, have obtained righteousness, even the righteousness
   which is by faith:

   31 But Israel, by following after the law of righteousness, has not
   attained to the law of righteousness.

   32 Why? Because [they followed after it] not by faith, but as it were
   by works; for they have stumbled at the stone of stumbling,

   33 According to what is written, "Behold, I lay in Sion a stone of
   stumbling and a rock of offense:" and, "Every one who believes in him
   shall not be ashamed."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 10

   1 Brethren, the kind desire of my heart, and prayer to God for Israel,
   is for their salvation.

   2 For I bear to them a testimony, that they have a zeal for God; but
   not according to knowledge,

   3 For being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to
   establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to the
   righteousness of God;

   4 For the end of the law is Christ for righteousness to every one who
   believes.

   5 For Moses describes the righteousness which is by the law, ^"The man
   who shall do these things shall live by them:"

   6 But the righteousness, which is by faith, saith thus, "Say not in
   thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?' this is to bring, down
   Christ;

   7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep?' that is to bring up Christ
   again from the dead:" but what does it say?

   8 "Nigh thee is the word, in thy mouth and in thy heart:" this is the
   word of' faith which we preach, --

   9 That if thou wilt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe
   in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
   saved;

   10 For with the heart we believe to righteousness, and with the mouth
   confession is made to salvation; for the Scripture says,

   11 "Every one who believes in him shall not be ashamed:"

   12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the
   same is the Lord of all, being rich to all who call on him;

   13 For, "whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."

   14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and
   how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how
   shall they hear without a preacher?

   15 And how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written,
   "How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim peace, who proclaim
   good things!"

   16 But all have not obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says, "Who has
   believed our report?"

   17 Faith then is by hearing, and hearing through the word of God.

   18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes, verily, "Into all the earth has
   gone forth their sound, and into the ends of the world their words."

   19 But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, "I will provoke
   them to jealousy by them who are not a people, and by a foolish nation
   will I irritate them:"

   20 Then Isaiah is bold and says, "I have been found by those who sought
   me not, I have been made manifest to those, who inquired not for me;

   21 But of Israel he says, "Daily have I stretched forth my hands to a
   people disobedient and gain saying."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 11

   1 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? By no means; for I also am
   an Israelite, from the seed of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.

   2 God has not cast away his people whom he has foreknown. Know ye not
   what the Scripture saith as to Elias? how he appeals to God against
   Israel, saying,

   3 "Lord, thy prophets have they killed, and thy altars have they pulled
   down, and I am left alone, and they seek my life?"

   4 But what says the answer of God to him? "I have reserved for myself
   seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal."

   5 So now, even at this time, there is a remnant according to the
   election of grace.

   6 And if through grace, then no longer by works, otherwise grace is no
   longer grace; but if by works, then no longer by grace, otherwise work
   is no longer work.

   7 What then? That which Israel seeks, he has not obtained; but election
   has obtained it, and the rest have been blinded,

   8 As it is written, "God has given them the spirit of compunction, eyes
   so as not to see, and ears so as not to hear," even to this day;

   9 And David says, "Be their table for a snare and for a trap, and for a
   stumbling, and for a recompense to them;

   10 Darkened be their eyes so as not to see, and their back ever bow
   thou down."

   11 I say then, Have they stumbled so as wholly to fall? By no means;
   but by their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles in order to provoke
   them to jealousy.

   12 But if their fall be the riches of the world, and their diminution
   the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?

   13 Even to you Gentiles do I speak, -- As far, doubtless, as I am the
   Apostle of the Gentiles, I make illustrious my office,

   14 If by any means I shall provoke to emulation my flesh, and shall
   save some of them.

   15 If indeed their rejection be the reconciliation of the world, what
   will be their resumption but life from the dead?

   16 Now if the first-fruits be holy, even so the lump; and if the root
   be holy, so also the branches.

   17 If indeed some of the branches have been broken off, and thou, a
   wild olive, hast been ingrafted instead of them, and hast become a
   partaker of the root and fatness of the olive,

   18 Glory not against the branches; but if thou gloriest, it is not thou
   who bearest the root, but the root thee.

   19 Thou wilt then say, "Broken off have been the branches, that I might
   be ingrafted."

   20 Be it so: for unbelief have they been broken off, and thou by faith
   standest; be not high-minded, but fear:

   21 For if God spared not the natural branches, beware lest he should
   not spare thee.

   22 See then the kindness and the severity of God; towards those indeed
   who have fallen, severity; but towards thee kindness, if thou
   continuest in his kindness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off:

   23 And they, if they remain not in unbelief, shall be ingrafted; for
   God is able to ingraft them again.

   24 For if thou hast been cut off from the wild olive, which is so by
   nature, and hast contrary to nature been ingrafted in the true olive,
   much more shall they, according to nature, be ingrafted in their own
   olive.

   25 I would not indeed, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this
   mystery, lest you should be proud among yourselves, that blindness has
   in part happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles shall
   come in:

   26 And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, "Come from Sion
   shall the Deliverer, and shall turn away impieties from Jacob;

   27 And this shall be my covenant with them, when I shall take away
   their sins."

   28 As to the gospel they are indeed enemies on your account; but as to
   election they are beloved on account of the fathers;

   29 For without repentance are the gifts and the calling of God.

   30 As indeed ye also formerly believed not God, but have now obtained
   mercy through their unbelief;

   31 So also they have not now believed, because ye have obtained mercy,
   that they may also obtain mercy:

   32 For God has shut up all under unbelief, that he might show mercy to
   all.

   33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of
   God! how incomprehensible are his judgments and unsearchable his ways!

   34 Who indeed has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been to him a
   counselor?

   35 Or, who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him
   again?

   36 For from him and through him and for him are all things: to him be
   glory for ever. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 12

   1 I beseech you then, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your
   bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, as your rational
   service.

   2 And conform not yourselves to this world, but be ye transformed by
   the renovation of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and
   acceptable and perfect will of God.

   3 I indeed say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every
   one of you, that he be not above measure wise, beyond what he ought to
   be wise; but that he be wise unto sobriety, as God has to each
   distributed the measure of faith.

   4 For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not
   the same office;

   5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members of
   one another.

   6 Now having gifts differing according to the grace given to us,
   whether prophecy, let us use it according to the analogy of faith;

   7 Or ministry, in ministering; or the teacher, in teaching;

   8 Or the exhorter, in exhortation; or the giver, in simplicity; or the
   president, with care; or he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

   9 Let love be undissembled: turn away from evil, cleave to what is
   good.

   10 Be ready with brotherly love to love one another, anticipating each
   other with honor.

   11 In business be not slothful, in spirit fervent, serving the time;

   12 Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, persevering in prayer,

   13 Distributing to the necessities of the saints, following
   hospitality.

   14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and pray for no evil.

   15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep,

   16 Having the same feeling towards one another, not thinking arrogantly
   of yourselves, but accommodating yourselves to humble things: be not
   wise in your own esteem.

   17 To no man render evil for evil, providing honest things before all
   men.

   18 If it be possible, as far as you can, cultivate peace with all men.

   19 Avenge not yourselves, beloved; but give place to wrath; for it is
   written, "Mine is vengeance, and I will repay, saith the Lord."

   20 If then thine enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him
   drink: for by so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

   21 Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 13

   1 Let every soul be subject to the supreme powers; for there is no
   power but from God; and the powers that be have been ordained by God.

   2 He therefore who resists the power, resists the ordination of God;
   and they who resist, shall for themselves receive judgment.

   3 For princes are not for terror to good but to evil works: wouldest
   thou then not fear the power? Do good, and from it thou shalt have
   praise;

   4 For he is God's minister to thee for good: but if thou doest any
   evil, fear; for not in vain does he bear the sword, since he is God's
   minister, an avenger for wrath against those who do evil.

   5 It is therefore necessary to be subject, not only on account of
   wrath, but also on account of conscience.

   6 For this reason also pay tributes, since they are God's ministers,
   constantly attending to this very thing.

   7 Render then to all what is due; to whom tribute is due, tribute; to
   whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honor, honor.

   8 To no one owe ye anything, except to love one another; for he who
   loves another, has fulfilled the law;

   9 For this, "Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou
   shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be
   any other precept, it is comprehended in this saying, Thou shalt love
   thy neighbor as thyself."

   10 Love works no evil to a neighbor; the fulfilling then of the law is
   love.

   11 Moreover, as ye know the time, that the hour is, when we ought to
   have awakened already from sleep, (for nearer is now our salvation than
   when we believed,)

   12 The night is far advanced, and the day has approached; let us then
   cast away the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light:

   13 Let us walk decently as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness,
   not in chamberings and lasciviousness, not in contention and envy;

   14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and have no care for the flesh
   for the sake of its lusts.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 14

   1 Now him who is weak in faith receiver not for the debatings of
   questions.

   2 Let him indeed who believes eat everything; but he who is weak, eats
   herbs.

   3 Let not him who eats, despise him who abstains; and let not him who
   abstains, condemn him who eats, since God has received him.

   4 Who art thou who judgest the servant of another? to his own Lord he
   stands or falls: he shall indeed stand, for God is able to make him
   stand.

   5 One indeed esteems a day above a day; but another esteems every day
   alike: let every one be fully persuaded in his own mind.

   6 He who regards a day, regards it for the Lord; and he who regards not
   a day, regards it not for the Lord: he who eats, eats for the Lord, for
   he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, abstains for the Lord, and
   gives thanks to God;

   7 For no one of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself;

   8 For whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die
   to the Lord; whether then we live or die, we are the Lord's.

   9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose and lived again, that he
   might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living.

   10 But thou, [488] why dost thou judge thy brother? or also thou [489]
   why dost thou despise thy brother? for we must all stand before the
   tribunal of Christ;

   11 For it is written, "Live do I, saith the Lord; to me shall bow every
   knee, and every tongue shall confess to God."

   12 Every one of us then shall give an account of himself to God.

   13 Let us therefore no more judge one another; but rather judge this,
   that no occasion of falling or an offense be given to a brother.

   14 I know and am persuaded, that in the Lord Jesus nothing is in itself
   unclean: but he who regards anything unclean, to him it is unclean.

   15 But if on account of meat thy brother is grieved, thou no longer
   walkest consistently with love: by thy meat destroy not him for whom
   Christ died.

   16 Let not then your good be subject to the evil-speaking of men.

   17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and
   peace and joy through the Holy Spirit.

   18 For he who in these things serves Christ, is acceptable to God and
   approved by men.

   19 Let us then follow the things of peace and of mutual edification:

   20 On account of meat destroy not the work of God. All things are
   indeed pure; but evil it is for man to eat with offense.

   21 It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything,
   by which thy brother may fall, or be offended, or be weakened.

   22 Hast thou faith? Have it for thyself before God: happy is he who
   condemns not himself in that which he examines

   23 But he who is undecided, if he eat, is condemned; for he eats not in
   faith: and whatsoever is not from faith is sin.

   CHAPTER 15

   1 Now we who are able ought to bear the infirmities of the unable, and
   not to please ourselves:

   2 Let indeed each of us please his neighbor for good, to his
   edification.

   3 For even Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, "The
   reproaches of those who reproached thee, fell upon me."

   4 For whatsoever things have been before written, have been written for
   our instruction, that through the patience and consolation of the
   Scriptures we might have hope:

   5 And may the God of patience and of consolation grant you to have the
   same mind towards one another, according to Christ Jesus,

   6 That ye may unanimously, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   7 Receive ye then one another, as Christ has received us, to the glory
   of God.

   8 Now I say, that Jesus Christ became the minister of the circumcision
   for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers,

   9 The Gentiles also ought to glorify God for his mercy, as it is
   written, "On this account will I confess to thee among the Gentiles,
   and to thy name will I sing"

   10 And again he says, "Exult, ye Gentiles, with his people;"

   11 And further, "Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and praise him
   together, all ye nations:"

   12 And again Isaiah says, "There shall be the root; of Jesse, and he
   who shall rise up to reign over the

   13 Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope." And may the God of hope
   fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in
   hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.

   14 But I am persuaded, my brethren, even I myself, concerning you, that
   ye are also yourselves full of' goodness, having been filled with all
   knowledge, being able to admonish one another.

   15 The more boldly, however, have I written to you, my brethren, in
   part, as putting you in mind, on account of the grace given to me by
   God,

   16 That I should be the minister of Christ to the Gentiles,
   consecrating the gospel of Christ, that the offering up of the Gentiles
   might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

   17 I have therefore reason for glorying, through Jesus Christ, in the
   things of God.

   18 I will not indeed dare to speak anything of those things which
   Christ has not done through me, as to the obedience of the Gentiles, by
   word and work,

   19 Through the power of signs and of wonders, through the power of the
   Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum,

   20 I have spread more fully [490] the gospel of Christ; thus
   endeavoring to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, that I
   might not build on another's foundation;

   21 But, as it is written, "They to whom it has not been declared
   concerning him, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall
   understand."

   22 I have on this account also been often hindered from coming to you,

   23 But now, having a place no longer in these regions, and having a
   desire for many years to come to you,

   24 When I go to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope that when I go
   there I shall see you, and that I shall be brought on my way thither by
   you, if however I shall first be in part filled by a converse with you.

   25 But I am now going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.

   26 For it has pleased Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution to
   the saints who are at Jerusalem:

   27 It has pleased them, I say, and their debtors they are; for if the
   Gentiles have partaken of their spiritual things, they ought also to
   minister to them in temporal things.

   28 When therefore I shall have performed this, and have sealed to them
   this fruit, I shall go by you to Spain:

   29 And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of
   the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

   30 Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the
   love of the Spirit, that ye strive with me in your prayers for me to
   God,

   31 That I may be delivered from the unbelieving in Judea, and that my
   service, undertaken for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints;

   32 That with joy I may come to you by the will of God, and may,
   together with you, be refreshed.

   33 And the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

   CHAPTER 16

   1 Now I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a deaconess of the
   Cenchrean Church;

   2 That ye receive her in the Lord, as it becomes saints, and that ye
   assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of' you; for she has
   been a helper to many, and to me also.

   3 Salute Prisca and Aquila, my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,

   4 Who for my life laid down their own necks, to whom not I alone give
   thanks, but also all the Churches of the Gentiles,

   5 And the Church in their house. Salute Epenetus, my beloved, who is
   the first-fruit of Achaia in the Lord

   6 Salute Mary, who has labored much with us.

   7 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow-captives, who
   are celebrated among the Apostles, and who were before me in Christ.

   8 Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.

   9 Salute Urban, our helper in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.

   10 Salute Apelles, approved in Christ. Salute those who are of the
   family of Aristobulus.

   11 Salute Herodion, my kinsman. Salute those of the family of
   Narcissus, who are in the Lord.

   12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who have labored much in the Lord.
   Salute the beloved Persis, who has labored much in the Lord.

   13 Salute Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

   14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
   brethren who are with them.

   15 Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and
   all the saints who are with them.

   16 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The Churches of Christ salute
   you.

   17 But I beseech you, brethren, to observe those who stir up divisions
   and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learnt, and to
   avoid them:

   18 For they, who are such, serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but, their
   own belly; and by courteous language and flattery deceive the hearts of
   the simple.

   19 Your obedience indeed has been published to all: I am therefore glad
   on your account; but I wish you to be wise for good,

   20 And simple for evil. And the God of peace shall shortly bruise Satan
   under your feet,. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

   21 Salute you do Timothy, my fellow-worker, and Lucius and Jason and
   Sosipater, my kinsmen.

   22 Salute you do I Terrius, who have written this Epistle, in the Lord.

   23 Salute you does Gaius, my host and of the whole Church. Salute you
   does Erastus, the treasurer of the city, and Quartus a brother.

   24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

   25 Now to him who is able to confirm you according to my gospel, even
   the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the
   mystery, which was hid in former ages,

   26 But has been now made known, and through the prophetic Scriptures
   proclaimed, according to the appointment of the eternal God, for the
   obedience of faith among all nations

   27 To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ,, be glory for ever.
   Amen.

   Sent to the Romans, from Corinth, by Phoebe,
   a deaconess of the Cenchrean Church.
