THE  BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL 

I  have  been  asked  to  republish  these  notes — which 
appeared  in  a  weekly  paper — as  a  rough  sketch  of  cer¬ 
tain  aspects  of  the  institution  of  Private  Property, 
now  so  completely  forgotten  amid  the  journalistic 
jubilations  over  Private  Enterprise.  The  very  fact 
that  the  publicists  say  so  much  of  the  latter  and  so 
little  of  the  former  is  a  measure  of  the  moral  tone  of 
the  times.  A  pickpocket  is  obviously  a  champion  of 
private  enterprise.  But  it  would  perhaps  be  an  ex¬ 
aggeration  to  say  that  a  pickpocket  is  a  champion  of 
private  property.  The  point  about  Capitalism  and 
Commercialism,  as  conducted  of  late,  is  that  they 
have  really  preached  the  extension  of  business  rather 
than  the  preservation  of  belongings;  and  have  at  best 
tried  to  disguise  the  pickpocket  with  some  of  the  vir¬ 
tues  of  the  pirate.  The  point  about  Communism  is 
that  it  only  reforms  the  pickpocket  by  forbidding 
pockets. 

Pockets  and  possessions  generally  seem  to  me  to 
have  not  only  a  more  normal  but  a  more  dignified  de¬ 
fence  than  the  rather  dirty  individualism  that  talks 
about  private  enterprise.  In  the  hope  that  it  may  pos-

sibly  help  others  to  understand  it,  I  have  decided  to 
reproduce  these  studies  as  they  stand,  hasty  and 
sometimes  merely  topical  as  they  were.  It  is  indeed 
very  hard  to  reproduce  them  in  this  form,  because 
they  were  editorial  notes  to  a  controversy  largely  con¬ 
ducted  by  others;  but  the  general  idea  is  at  least 
present.  In  any  case,  “private  enterprise”  is  no  very 
noble  way  of  stating  the  truth  of  one  of  the  Ten  Com¬ 
mandments.  But  there  was  at  least  a  time  when  it  was 
more  or  less  true.  The  Manchester  Radicals  preached 
a  rather  crude  and  cruel  sort  of  competition;  but  at 
least  they  practised  what  they  preached.  The  news¬ 
papers  now  praising  private  enterprise  are  preaching 
the  very  opposite  of  anything  that  anybody  dreams 
of  practising.  The  practical  tendency  of  all  trade  and 
business  to-day  is  towards  big  commercial  combina¬ 
tions,  often  more  imperial,  more  impersonal,  more  in¬ 
ternational  than  many  a  communist  commonwealth 
— things  that  are  at  least  collective  if  not  collectivist. 
It  is  all  very  well  to  repeat  distractedly,  “What  are 
we  coming  to,  with  all  this  Bolshevism?”  It  is  equally 
relevant  to  add,  “What  are  we  coming  to,  even  with¬ 
out  Bolshevism?”  The  obvious  answer  is — Monopoly. 
It  is  certainly  not  private  enterprise.  The  American 
Trust  is  not  private  enterprise.  It  would  be  truer 
to  call  the  Spanish  Inquisition  private  judgment. 
Monopoly  is  neither  private  nor  enterprising.  It  exists 
to  prevent  private  enterprise.  And  that  system  of  trust 
or  monopoly,  that  complete  destruction  of  property. 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  5 

would  still  be  the  present  goal  of  all  our  progress,  if 
there  were  not  a  Bolshevist  in  the  world. 

Now  I  am  one  of  those  who  believe  that  the  cure  for 
centralization  is  decentralization.  It  has  been  de- 
scribed  as  a  paradox.  There  is  apparently  something 
elvish  and  fantastic  about  saying  that  when  capital 
has  come  to  be  too  much  in  the  hand  of  the  few,  the 
right  thing  is  to  restore  it  into  the  hands  of  the  many. 
The  Socialist  would  put  it  in  the  hands  of  even  fewer 
people;  but  those  people  would  be  politicians,  who 
(as  we  know)  always  administer  it  in  the  interests  of 
the  many.  But  before  I  put  before  the  reader  things 
written  in  the  very  thick  of  the  current  controversy, 
I  foresee  it  will  be  necessary  to  preface  them  with 
these  few  paragraphs,  explaining  a  few  of  the  terms 
and  amplifying  a  few  of  the  assumptions.  I  was  in  the 
weekly  paper  arguing  with  people  who  knew  the 
shorthand  of  this  particular  argument;  but  to  be 
clearly  understood,  we  must  begin  with  a  few  defini¬ 
tions  or,  at  least,  descriptions.  I  assure  the  reader 
that  I  use  words  in  quite  a  definite  sense,  but  it  is 
possible  that  he  may  use  them  in  a  different  sense; 
and  a  muddle  and  misunderstanding  of  that  sort  does 
not  even  rise  to  the  dignity  of  a  difference  of  opin¬ 
ion. 

For  instance,  Capitalism  is  really  a  very  unpleasant 
word.  It  is  also  a  very  unpleasant  thing.  Yet  the 
thing  I  have  in  mind,  when  I  say  so,  is  quite  definite 
and  definable;  only  the  name  is  a  very  unworkable 


6  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

word  for  it.  But  obviously  we  must  have  some  word 
for  it.  When  I  say  “Capitalism,”  I  commonly  mean 
something  that  may  be  stated  thus:  “That  economic 
condition  in  which  there  is  a  class  of  capitalists, 
roughly  recognizable  and  relatively  small,  in  whose 
possession  so  much  of  the  capital  is  concentrated  as 
to  necessitate  a  very  large  majority  of  the  citizens 
serving  those  capitalists  for  a  wage.”  This  particu¬ 
lar  state  of  things  can  and  does  exist,  and  we  must 
have  some  word  for  it,  and  some  way  of  discussing 
it.  But  this  is  undoubtedly  a  very  bad  word,  because 
it  is  used  by  other  people  to  mean  quite  other  things. 
Some  people  seem  to  mean  merely  private  property. 
Others  suppose  that  capitalism  must  mean  anything 
involving  the  use  of  capital.  But  if  that  use  is  too  lit¬ 
eral,  it  is  also  too  loose  and  even  too  large.  If  the  use 
of  capital  is  capitalism,  then  everything  is  capitalism. 
Bolshevism  is  capitalism  and  anarchist  communism  is 
capitalism;  and  every  revolutionary  scheme,  however 
wild,  is  still  capitalism.  Lenin  and  Trotsky  believe  as 
much  as  Lloyd  George  and  Thomas  that  the  economic 
operations  of  to-day  must  leave  something  over  for 
the  economic  operations  of  to-morrow.  And  that  is 
all  that  capital  means  in  its  economic  sense.  In  that 
case,  the  word  is  useless.  My  use  of  it  may  be  arbi¬ 
trary,  but  it  is  not  useless.  If  capitalism  means  pri¬ 
vate  property,  I  am  capitalist.  If  capitalism  means 
capital,  everybody  is  capitalist.  But  if  capitalism 
means  this  particular  condition  of  capital,  only  paid 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  7 

out  to  the  mass  in  the  form  of  wages,  then  it  does 
mean  something,  even  if  it  ought  to  mean  something 
else. 

The  truth  is  that  what  we  call  Capitalism  ought  to 
be  called  Proletarianism.  The  point  of  it  is  not  that 
some  people  have  capital,  but  that  most  people  only 
have  wages  because  they  do  not  have  capital.  1  have 
made  an  heroic  effort  in  my  time  to  walk  about  the 
world  always  saying  Proletarianism  instead  of  Capi¬ 
talism.  But  my  path  has  been  a  thorny  one  of  trou¬ 
bles  and  misunderstandings.  I  find  that  when  I  criti¬ 
cize  the  Duke  of  Northumberland  for  his  Proletari¬ 
anism,  my  meaning  does  not  get  home.  When  I  say 
I  should  often  agree  with  the  Morning  Post  if  it  were 
not  so  deplorably  Proletarian,  there  seems  to  be  some 
strange  momentary  impediment  to  the  complete  com¬ 
munion  of  mind  with  mind.  Yet  that  would  be  strictly 
accurate;  for  what  I  complain  of,  in  the  current  de¬ 
fence  of  existing  capitalism,  is  that  it  is  a  defence  of 
keeping  most  men  in  wage  dependence;  that  is,  keep¬ 
ing  most  men  without  capital.  I  am  not  the  sort  of 
precisian  who  prefers  conveying  correctly  what  he 
doesn’t  mean,  rather  than  conveying  incorrectly  what 
he  does.  I  am  totally  indifferent  to  the  term  as  com¬ 
pared  to  the  meaning.  I  do  not  care  whether  I  call  one 
thing  or  the  other  by  this  mere  printed  word  begin¬ 
ning  with  a  “C,”  so  long  as  it  is  applied  to  one  thing 
and  not  the  other.  I  do  not  mind  using  a  term  as  arbi¬ 
trary  as  a  mathematical  sign,  if  it  is  accepted  like  a 


8  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

mathematical  sign.  I  do  not  mind  calling  Property  x 
and  Capitalism  y,  so  long  as  nobody  thinks  it  neces¬ 
sary  to  say  that  x=y.  I  do  not  mind  saying  “cat”  for 
capitalism  and  “dog”  for  distributism,  so  long  as  peo¬ 
ple  understand  that  the  things  are  different  enough  to 
fight  like  cat  and  dog.  The  proposal  of  the  wider  dis¬ 
tribution  of  capital  remains  the  same,  whatever  we 
call  it,  or  whatever  we  call  the  present  glaring  con¬ 
tradiction  of  it.  It  is  the  same  whether  we  state  it  by 
saying  that  there  is  too  much  capitalism  in  the  one 
sense  or  too  little  capitalism  in  the  other.  And  it  is 
really  quite  pedantic  to  say  that  the  use  of  capital 
must  be  capitalist.  We  might  as  fairly  say  that  any¬ 
thing  social  must  be  Socialist;  that  Socialism  can  be 
identified  with  a  social  evening  or  a  social  glass. 
Which,  I  grieve  to  say,  is  not  the  case. 

Nevertheless,  there  is  enough  verbal  vagueness 
about  Socialism  to  call  for  a  word  of  definition.  So¬ 
cialism  is  a  system  which  makes  the  corporate  unity 
of  society  responsible  for  all  its  economic  processes, 
or  all  those  affecting  life  and  essential  living.  If  any¬ 
thing  important  is  sold,  the  Government  has  sold  it; 
if  anything  important  is  given,  the  Government  has 
given  it;  if  anything  important  is  even  tolerated,  the 
Government  is  responsible  for  tolerating  it.  This  is 
the  very  reverse  of  anarchy;  it  is  an  extreme  enthu¬ 
siasm  for  authority.  It  is  in  many  ways  worthy  of  the 
moral  dignity  of  the  mind;  it  is  a  collective  accept¬ 
ance  of  a  very  complete  responsibility.  But  it  is  silly 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  9 

of  Socialists  to  complain  of  our  saying  that  it  must  be 
a  destruction  of  liberty.  It  is  almost  equally  silly  of 
Anti-Socialists  to  complain  of  the  unnatural  and  un¬ 
balanced  brutality  of  the  Bolshevist  Government  in 
crushing  a  political  opposition.  A  Socialist  Govern¬ 
ment  is  one  which  in  its  nature  does  not  tolerate  any 
true  and  real  opposition.  For  there  the  Government 
provides  everything;  and  it  is  absurd  to  ask  a  Gov¬ 
ernment  to  provide  an  opposition. 

You  cannot  go  to  the  Sultan  and  say  reproach¬ 
fully,  “You  have  made  no  arrangements  for  your 
brother  dethroning  you  and  seizing  the  Caliphate.” 
You  cannot  go  to  a  medieval  king  and  say,  “Kindly 
lend  me  two  thousand  spears  and  one  thousand  bow¬ 
men,  as  I  wish  to  raise  a  rebellion  against  you.” 
Still  less  can  you  reproach  a  Government  which  pro¬ 
fesses  to  set  up  everything,  because  it  has  not  set 
up  anything  to  pull  down  all  it  has  set  up.  Opposi¬ 
tion  and  rebellion  depend  on  property  and  liberty. 
They  can  only  be  tolerated  where  other  rights  have 
been  allowed  to  strike  root,  besides  the  central  right 
of  the  ruler.  Those  rights  must  be  protected  by  a 
morality  which  even  the  ruler  will  hesitate  to  defy. 
The  critic  of  the  State  can  only  exist  where  a  religious 
sense  of  right  protects  his  claims  to  his  own  bow  and 
spear;  or  at  least,  to  his  own  pen  or  his  own  printing- 
press.  It  is  absurd  to  suppose  that  he  could  borrow 
the  royal  pen  to  advocate  regicide  or  use  the  Govern¬ 
ment  printing-presses  to  expose  the  corruption  of  the 


10 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


Government.  Yet  it  is  the  whole  point  of  Socialism, 
the  whole  case  for  Socialism,  that  unless  all  printing- 
presses  are  Government  printing-presses,  printers 
may  be  oppressed.  Everything  is  staked  on  the  State's 
justice;  it  is  putting  all  the  eggs  in  one  basket.  Many 
of  them  will  be  rotten  eggs;  but  even  then  you  will 
not  be  allowed  to  use  them  at  political  elections. 

About  fifteen  years  ago  a  few  of  us  began  to  preach, 
in  the  old  New  Age  and  New  Witness,  a  policy  of 
small  distributed  property  (which  has  since  assumed 
the  awkward  but  accurate  name  of  Distributism),  as 
we  should  have  said  then,  against  the  two  extremes 
of  Capitalism  and  Communism.  The  first  criticism 
we  received  was  from  the  most  brilliant  Fabians,  es¬ 
pecially  Mr.  Bernard  Shaw.  And  the  form  which  that 
first  criticism  took  was  simply  to  tell  us  that  our  ideal 
was  impossible.  It  was  only  a  case  of  Catholic  credu¬ 
lity  about  fairy-tales.  The  Law  of  Rent,  and  other 
economic  laws,  made  it  inevitable  that  the  little  rivu¬ 
lets  of  property  should  run  down  into  the  pool  of 
plutocracy.  In  truth,  it  was  the  Fabian  wit,  and  not 
merely  the  Tory  fool,  who  confronted  our  vision  with 
that  venerable  verbal  opening,  “If  it  were  all  divided 
up  to-morrow - ” 

Nevertheless,  we  had  an  answer  even  in  those  days, 
and  though  we  have  since  found  many  others,  it  will 
clarify  the  question  if  I  repeat  this  point  of  principle. 
It  is  true  that  I  believe  in  fairy-tales — in  the  sense 
that  I  marvel  so  much  at  what  does  exist  that  I  am 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  11 

the  readier  to  admit  what  might.  I  understand  the 
man  who  believes  in  the  Sea  Serpent  on  the  ground 
that  there  are  more  fish  in  the  sea  than  ever  came  out 
of  it.  But  I  do  it  the  more  because  the  other  man,  in 
his  ardour  for  disproving  the  Sea  Serpent,  always  ar¬ 
gues  that  there  are  not  only  no  snakes  in  Iceland,  but 
none  in  the  world.  Suppose  Mr.  Bernard  Shaw,  com¬ 
menting  on  this  credulity,  were  to  blame  me  for  be¬ 
lieving  (on  the  word  of  some  lying  priest)  that  stones 
could  be  thrown  up  into  the  air  and  hang  there  sus¬ 
pended  like  a  rainbow.  Suppose  he  told  me  tenderly 
that  I  should  not  believe  this  Popish  fable  of  the 
magic  stones,  if  I  had  ever  had  the  Law  of  Gravity 
scientifically  explained  to  me.  And  suppose,  after  all 
this,  I  found  he  was  only  talking  about  the  impossi¬ 
bility  of  building  an  arch.  I  think  most  of  us  would 
form  two  main  conclusions  about  him  and  his  school. 
First,  we  should  think  them  very  ill-informed  about 
what  is  really  meant  by  recognizing  a  law  of  nature. 
A  law  of  nature  can  be  recognized  by  resisting  it,  or 
out-manoeuvring  it,  or  even  using  it  against  itself,  as 
in  the  case  of  the  arch.  And  second,  and  much  more 
strongly,  we  should  think  them  astonishingly  ill- 
informed  about  what  has  already  been  done  upon  this 
earth. 

Similarly,  the  first  fact  in  the  discussion  of  whether 
small  properties  can  exist  is  the  fact  that  they  do 
exist.  It  is  a  fact  almost  equally  unmistakable  that 
they  not  only  exist  but  endure.  Mr.  Shaw  affirmed, 


12  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

in  a  sort  of  abstract  fury,  that  “small  properties  will 
not  stay  small.”  Now  it  is  interesting  to  note  here 
that  the  opponents  of  anything  like  a  several  pro¬ 
prietary  bring  two  highly  inconsistent  charges  against 
it.  They  are  perpetually  telling  us  that  the  peasant 
life  in  Latin  or  other  countries  is  monotonous,  is  un¬ 
progressive,  is  covered  with  weedy  superstitions,  and 
is  a  sort  of  survival  of  the  Stone  Age.  Yet  even  while 
they  taunt  us  with  its  survival,  they  argue  that  it  can 
never  survive.  They  point  to  the  peasant  as  a  peren¬ 
nial  stick-in-the-mud;  and  then  refuse  to  plant  him 
anywhere,  on  the  specific  ground  that  he  would  not 
stick.  Now,  the  first  of  the  two  types  of  denunciation 
is  arguable  enough;  but  in  order  to  denounce  peas¬ 
antries,  the  critics  must  admit  that  there  are  peas¬ 
antries  to  denounce.  And  if  it  were  true  that  they  al¬ 
ways  tended  rapidly  to  disappear,  it  would  not  be 
true  that  they  exhibited  those  primitive  customs  and 
conservative  opinions  which  they  not  only  do,  in  fact, 
exhibit,  but  which  the  critics  reproach  them  with  ex¬ 
hibiting.  They  cannot  in  common  sense  accuse  a 
thing  at  once  of  being  antiquated  and  of  being  ephem¬ 
eral.  It  is,  of  course,  the  dry  fact,  to  be  seen  in  broad 
daylight,  that  small  peasant  properties  are  not  ephem¬ 
eral.  But  anyhow,  Mr.  Shaw  and  his  school  must  not 
say  that  arches  cannot  be  built,  and  then  that  they 
disfigure  the  landscape.  The  Distributive  State  is  not 
a  hypothesis  for  him  to  demolish;  it  is  a  phenomenon 
for  him  to  explain. 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  13 

The  truth  is  that  the  conception  that  small  prop¬ 
erty  evolves  into  capitalism  is  a  precise  picture  of 
what  practically  never  takes  place.  The  truth  is  at¬ 
tested  even  by  facts  of  geograph)',  facts  which,  as  it 
seems  to  me,  have  been  strangely  overlooked.  Nine 
times  out  of  ten,  an  industrial  civilization  of  the 
modern  capitalist  type  does  not  arise,  wherever  else 
it  may  arise,  in  places  where  there  has  hitherto  been 
a  distributive  civilization  like  that  of  a  peasantry. 
Capitalism  is  a  monster  that  grows  in  deserts.  In¬ 
dustrial  servitude  has  almost  everywhere  arisen  in 
those  empty  spaces  where  the  older  civilization  was 
thin  or  absent.  Thus  it  grew  up  easily  in  the  North 
of  England  rather  than  the  South;  precisely  because 
the  North  had  been  comparatively  empty  and  bar¬ 
barous  through  all  the  ages  when  the  South  had  a 
civilization  of  guilds  and  peasantries.  Thus  it  grew 
up  easily  in  the  American  continent  rather  than  the 
European;  precisely  because  it  had  nothing  to  sup¬ 
plant  in  America  but  a  few  savages,  while  in  Europe 
it  had  to  supplant  the  culture  of  multitudinous  farms. 
Everywhere  it  has  been  but  one  stride  from  the  mud- 
hut  to  the  manufacturing  town.  Everywhere  the  mud- 
hut  which  really  turned  into  the  free  farm  has  never 
since  moved  an  inch  towards  the  manufacturing 
town.  Wherever  there  was  the  mere  lord  and  the  mere 
serf,  they  could  almost  instantly  be  turned  into  the 
mere  employer  and  the  mere  employee.  Wherever 
there  has  been  the  free  man,  even  when  he  was  rela-

tively  less  rich  and  powerful,  his  mere  memory  has 
made  complete  industrial  capitalism  impossible.  It  is 
an  enemy  that  has  sown  these  tares,  but  even  as  an 
enemy  he  is  a  coward.  For  he  can  only  sow  them  in 
waste  places,  where  no  wheat  can  spring  up  and  choke 
them. 

To  take  up  our  parable  again,  we  say  first  that 
arches  exist;  and  not  only  exist  but  remain.  A  hun¬ 
dred  Roman  aqueducts  and  amphitheatres  are  there  to 
show  that  they  can  remain  as  long  or  longer  than  any¬ 
thing  else.  And  if  a  progressive  person  informs  us  that 
an  arch  always  turns  into  a  factory  chimney,  or  even 
that  an  arch  always  falls  down  because  it  is  weaker 
than  a  factory  chimney,  or  even  that  wherever  it  does 
fall  down  people  perceive  that  they  must  replace  it 
by  a  factory  chimney — why,  we  shall  be  so  audacious 
as  to  cast  doubts  on  all  these  three  assertions.  All  we 
could  possibly  admit  is  that  the  principle  supporting 
the  chimney  is  simpler  than  the  principle  of  the  arch; 
and  for  that  very  reason  the  factory  chimney,  like  the 
feudal  tower,  can  rise  the  more  easily  in  a  howling 
wilderness. 

But  the  image  has  yet  a  further  application.  If  at 
this  moment  the  Latin  countries  are  largely  made  our 
model  in  the  matter  of  the  small  property,  it  is  only 
in  the  sense  in  which  they  would  have  been,  through 
certain  periods  of  history,  the  only  exemplars  of  the 
arch.  There  was  a  time  when  all  arches  were  Roman 
arches;  and  when  a  man  living  by  the  Liffey  or  the 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  15 

Thames  would  know  as  little  about  them  as  Mr. 
Shaw  knows  about  peasant  proprietors.  But  that  does 
not  mean  that  we  fight  for  something  merely  foreign, 
or  advance  the  arch  as  a  sort  of  Italian  ensign;  any 
more  than  we  want  to  make  the  Thames  as  yellow  as 
the  Tiber,  or  have  any  particular  taste  in  macaroni 
or  malaria.  The  principle  of  the  arch  is  human,  and 
applicable  to  and  by  all  humanity.  So  is  the  principle 
of  well-distributed  private  property.  That  a  few  Ro¬ 
man  arches  stood  in  ruins  in  Britain  is  not  a  proof 
that  arches  cannot  be  built,  but  on  the  contrary,  a 
proof  that  they  can. 

And  now,  to  complete  the  coincidence  or  analogy, 
what  is  the  principle  of  the  arch?  You  can  call  it,  if 
you  like,  an  affront  to  gravitation;  you  will  be  more 
correct  if  you  call  it  an  appeal  to  gravitation.  The 
principle  asserts  that  by  combining  separate  stones  of 
a  particular  shape  in  a  particular  way,  we  can  ensure 
that  their  very  tendency  to  fall  shall  prevent  them 
from  falling.  And  though  my  image  is  merely  an  il¬ 
lustration,  it  does  to  a  great  extent  hold  even  as 
to  the  success  of  more  equalized  properties.  What  up¬ 
holds  an  arch  is  an  equality  of  pressure  of  the  sep¬ 
arate  stones  upon  each  other.  The  equality  is  at  once 
mutual  aid  and  mutual  obstruction.  It  is  not  difficult 
to  show  that  in  a  healthy  society  the  moral  pressure 
of  different  private  properties  acts  in  exactly  the  same 
way.  But  if  the  other  school  finds  the  key  or  compari¬ 
son  insufficient,  it  must  find  some  other.  It  is  clear 


16  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

that  no  natural  forces  can  frustrate  the  fact.  To  say 
that  any  law,  such  as  that  of  rent,  makes  against  it  is 
true  only  in  the  sense  that  many  natural  laws  make 
against  all  morality  and  the  very  essentials  of  man¬ 
hood.  In  that  sense,  scientific  arguments  are  as  ir¬ 
relevant  to  our  case  for  property  as  Mr.  Shaw  used 
to  say  they  were  to  his  case  against  vivisection. 

Lastly,  it  is  not  only  true  that  the  arch  of  property 
remains,  it  is  true  that  the  building  of  such  arches 
increases,  both  in  quantity  and  quality.  For  instance, 
the  French  peasant  before  the  French  Revolution  was 
already  indefinitely  a  proprietor;  it  has  made  his 
property  more  private  and  more  absolute,  not  less. 
The  French  are  now  less  than  ever  likely  to  abandon 
the  system,  when  it  has  proved  for  the  second,  if 
not  the  hundredth  time,  the  most  stable  type  of  pros¬ 
perity  in  the  stress  of  war.  A  revolution  as  heroic,  and 
even  more  unconquerable,  has  already  in  Ireland  dis¬ 
regarded  alike  the  Socialist  dream  and  the  Capitalist 
reality,  with  a  driving  energy  of  which  no  one  has 
yet  dared  to  foresee  the  limits.  So,  when  the  round 
arch  of  the  Romans  and  the  Normans  had  remained 
for  ages  as  a  sort  of  relic,  the  rebirth  of  Christendom 
found  for  it  a  further  application  and  issue.  It  sprang 
in  an  instant  to  the  titanic  stature  of  the  Gothic; 
where  man  seemed  to  be  a  god  who  had  hanged  his 
worlds  upon  nothing.  Then  was  unsealed  again  some¬ 
thing  of  that  ancient  secret  which  had  so  strangely 
described  the  priest  as  the  builder  of  bridges.  And 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  17 

when  I  look  to-day  at  some  of  the  bridges  which  he 
built  above  the  air,  I  can  understand  a  man  still  call¬ 
ing  them  impossible,  as  their  only  possible  praise. 

What  do  we  mean  by  that  “equality  of  pressure” 
as  of  the  stones  in  an  arch?  More  will  be  said  of  this 
in  detail;  but  in  general  we  mean  that  the  modern 
passion  for  incessant  and  restless  buying  and  selling 
goes  along  with  the  extreme  inequality  of  men  too 
rich  or  too  poor.  The  explanation  of  the  continuity  of 
peasantries  (which  their  opponents  are  simply  forced 
to  leave  unexplained)  is  that,  where  that  independ¬ 
ence  exists,  it  is  valued  exactly  as  any  other  dig¬ 
nity  is  valued  when  it  is  regarded  as  normal  to  a 
man;  as  no  man  goes  naked  or  is  beaten  with  a  stick 
for  hire. 

The  theory  that  those  who  start  reasonably  equal 
cannot  remain  reasonably  equal  is  a  fallacy  founded 
entirely  on  a  society  in  which  they  start  extremely 
unequal.  It  is  quite  true  that  when  capitalism  has 
passed  a  certain  point,  the  broken  fragments  of  prop¬ 
erty  are  very  easily  devoured.  In  other  words,  it  is 
true  when  there  is  a  small  amount  of  small  property; 
but  it  is  quite  untrue  when  there  is  a  large  amount  of 
small  property.  To  argue  from  what  happened  in  the 
rush  of  big  business  and  the  rout  of  scattered  small 
businesses  to  what  must  always  happen  when  the  par¬ 
ties  are  more  on  a  level,  is  quite  illogical.  It  is  prov¬ 
ing  from  Niagara  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  lake. 
Once  tip  up  the  lake  and  the  whole  of  the  water  will 


18 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


rush  one  way;  as  the  whole  economic  tendency  of  cap¬ 
italist  inequality  rushes  one  way.  Leave  the  lake  as  a 
lake,  or  the  level  as  a  level,  and  there  is  nothing  to 
prevent  the  lake  remaining  until  the  crack  of  doom — 
as  many  levels  of  peasantry  seem  likely  to  remain 
until  the  crack  of  doom.  This  fact  is  proved  by  ex¬ 
perience,  even  if  it  is  not  explained  by  experience;  but, 
as  a  matter  of  fact,  it  is  possible  to  suggest  not  only 
the  experience  but  the  explanation.  The  truth  is  that 
there  is  no  economic  tendency  whatever  towards  the 
disappearance  of  small  property,  until  that  property 
becomes  so  very  small  as  to  cease  to  act  as  property 
at  all.  If  one  man  has  a  hundred  acres  and  another 
man  has  half  an  acre,  it  is  likely  enough  that  he  will 
be  unable  to  live  on  half  an  acre.  Then  there  will 
be  an  economic  tendency  for  him  to  sell  his  land  and 
make  the  other  man  the  proud  possessor  of  a  hundred 
and  a  half.  But  if  one  man  has  thirty  acres  and  the 
other  man  has  forty  acres,  there  is  no  economic  tend¬ 
ency  of  any  kind  whatever  to  make  the  first  man  sell 
to  the  second.  It  is  simply  false  to  say  that  the  first 
man  cannot  be  secure  of  thirty  or  the  second  man 
content  with  forty.  It  is  sheer  nonsense;  like  saying 
that  any  man  who  owns  a  bull  terrier  will  be  bound  to 
sell  it  to  somebody  who  owns  a  mastiff.  It  is  like  say¬ 
ing  that  I  cannot  own  a  horse  because  I  have  an  ec¬ 
centric  neighbour  who  owns  an  elephant. 

Needless  to  say,  those  who  insist  that  roughly 
equalized  ownership  cannot  exist,  base  their  whole 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  19 

argument  on  the  notion  that  it  has  existed.  They 
have  to  suppose,  in  order  to  prove  their  point,  that 
people  in  England,  for  instance,  did  begin  as  equals 
and  rapidly  reached  inequality.  And  it  only  rounds 
off  the  humour  of  their  whole  position  that  they  as¬ 
sume  the  existence  of  what  they  call  an  impossibility 
in  the  one  case  where  it  has  really  not  occurred.  They 
talk  as  if  ten  miners  had  run  a  race,  and  one  of  them 
became  the  Duke  of  Northumberland.  They  talk  as 
if  the  first  Rothschild  was  a  peasant  who  patiently 
planted  better  cabbages  than  the  other  peasants.  The 
truth  is  that  England  became  a  capitalist  country 
because  it  had  long  been  an  oligarchical  country.  It 
would  be  much  harder  to  point  out  in  what  way  a 
country  like  Denmark  need  become  oligarchical.  But 
the  case  is  even  stronger  when  we  add  the  ethical  to 
the  economic  common  sense.  When  there  is  once  es¬ 
tablished  a  widely  scattered  ownership,  there  is  a 
public  opinion  that  is  stronger  than  any  law;  and 
very  often  (what  in  modern  times  is  even  more  re¬ 
markable)  a  law  that  is  really  an  expression  of  public 
opinion.  It  may  be  very  difficult  for  modern  peo¬ 
ple  to  imagine  a  world  in  which  men  are  not  gener¬ 
ally  admired  for  covetousness  and  crushing  their 
neighbours  but  I  assure  them  that  such  strange 
patches  of  an  earthly  paradise  do  really  remain  on 
earth. 

The  truth  is  that  this  first  objection  of  impossi¬ 
bility  in  the  abstract  flies  flat  in  the  face  of  all  the 


20 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


facts  of  experience  and  human  nature.  It  is  not  true 
that  a  moral  custom  cannot  hold  most  men  content 
with  a  reasonable  status,  and  careful  to  preserve  it.  It 
is  as  if  we  were  to  say  that  because  some  men  are  more 
attractive  to  women  than  others,  therefore  the  inhabi¬ 
tants  of  Balham  under  Queen  Victoria  could  not  pos¬ 
sibly  have  been  arranged  on  a  monogamous  model, 
with  one  man  one  wife.  Sooner  or  later,  it  might  be 
said,  all  females  would  be  found  clustering  round  the 
fascinating  few,  and  nothing  but  bachelorhood  be  left 
for  the  unattractive  many.  Sooner  or  later  the  sub¬ 
urb  must  consist  of  a  hundred  hermitages  and  three 
harems.  But  this  is  not  the  case.  It  is  not  the  case  at 
present,  whatever  may  happen  if  the  moral  tradition 
of  marriage  is  really  lost  in  Balham.  So  long  as  that 
moral  tradition  is  alive,  so  long  as  stealing  other 
people’s  wives  is  reprobated  or  being  faithful  to  a 
spouse  is  admired,  there  are  limits  to  the  extent  to 
which  the  wildest  profligate  in  Balham  can  disturb 
the  balance  of  the  sexes.  So  any  land-grabber  would 
very  rapidly  find  that  there  were  limits  to  the  extent 
to  which  he  could  buy  up  land  in  an  Irish  or  Spanish 
or  Serbian  village.  When  it  is  really  thought  hateful 
to  take  Naboth’s  vineyard,  as  it  is  to  take  Uriah’s 
wife,  there  is  little  difficulty  in  finding  a  local  prophet 
to  pronounce  the  judgment  of  the  Lord.  In  an  atmos¬ 
phere  of  capitalism  the  man  who  lays  field  to  field 
is  flattered;  but  in  an  atmosphere  of  property  he  is 
promptly  jeered  at  or  possibly  stoned.  The  result  is 


BEGINNING  OF  THE  QUARREL  21 

that  the  village  has  not  sunk  into  plutocracy  or  !he 
suburb  into  polygamy. 

Property  is  a  point  of  honour.  The  true  contrary  of 
the  word  "property”  is  the  word  “prostitution.”  And 
it  is  not  true  that  a  human  being  will  always  sell 
what  is  sacred  to  that  sense  of  self-ownership,  whether 
it  be  the  body  or  the  boundary.  A  few  do  it  in  both 
cases;  and  by  doing  it  they  always  become  outcasts. 
But  it  is  not  true  that  a  majority  must  do  it;  and  any¬ 
body  who  says  it  is,  is  ignorant,  not  of  our  plans  and 
proposals,  not  of  anybody’s  visions  and  ideals,  not 
of  distributism  or  division  of  capital  by  this  or  that 
process,  but  of  the  facts  of  history  and  the  substance 
of  humanity.  He  is  a  barbarian  who  has  never  seen 
an  arch. 

In  the  notes  I  have  here  jotted  down  it  will  be  ob¬ 
vious,  of  course,  that  the  restoration  of  this  pattern, 
simple  as  it  is,  is  much  more  complicated  in  a  com¬ 
plicated  society.  Here  I  have  only  traced  it  in  the 
simplest  form  as  it  stood,  and  still  stands,  at  the  be¬ 
ginning  of  our  discussion.  I  disregard  the  view  that 
such  “reaction”  cannot  be.  I  hold  the  old  mystical 
dogma  that  what  Man  has  done,  Man  can  do.  My  crit¬ 
ics  seem  to  hold  a  still  more  mystical  dogma:  that 
Man  cannot  possibly  do  a  thing  because  he  has  done 
it.  That  is  what  seems  to  be  meant  by  saying  that 
small  property  is  “antiquated.”  It  really  means  that 
all  property  is  dead.  There  is  nothing  to  be  reached 
upon  the  present  lines  except  the  increasing  loss  of 


22 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


property  by  everybody,  as  something  swallowed  up 
into  a  system  equally  impersonal  and  inhuman, 
whether  we  call  it  Communism  or  Capitalism.  If  we 
cannot  go  back,  it  hardly  seems  worth  while  to  go 
forward. 

There  is  nothing  in  front  but  a  flat  wilderness  of 
standardization  either  by  Bolshevism  or  Big  Busi¬ 
ness.  But  it  is  strange  that  some  of  us  should  have 
seen  sanity,  if  only  in  a  vision,  while  the  rest  go  for¬ 
ward  chained  eternally  to  enlargement  without  liberty 
and  progress  without  hope. 


II 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR 

When  we  are  for  a  moment  satisfied,  or  sated,  with 
reading  the  latest  news  of  the  loftiest  social  circles,  or 
the  most  exact  records  of  the  most  responsible  courts 
of  justice,  we  naturally  turn  to  the  serial  story  in  the 
newspaper,  called  "Poisoned  by  Her  Mother”  or  “The 
Mystery  of  the  Crimson  Wedding  Ring,”  in  search 
of  something  calmer  and  more  quietly  convincing, 
more  restful,  more  domestic,  and  more  like  real  life. 
But  as  we  turn  over  the  pages,  in  passing  from  the 
incredible  fact  to  the  comparatively  credible  fiction, 
we  are  very  likely  to  encounter  a  particular  phrase 
on  the  general  subject  of  social  degeneracy.  It  is  one 
of  a  number  of  phrases  that  seem  to  be  kept  in  solid 
blocks  in  the  printing-offices  of  newspapers.  Like  most 
of  these  solid  statements,  it  is  of  a  soothing  character. 
It  is  like  the  headline  of  "Hopes  of  a  Settlement,” 
by  which  we  learn  that  things  are  unsettled;  or  that 
topic  of  the  "Revival  of  Trade,”  which  it  is  part  of 
the  journalistic  trade  periodically  to  revive.  The 
sentence  to  which  I  refer  is  to  this  effect:  that  the 
fears  about  social  degeneracy  need  not  disturb  us, 
because  such  fears  have  been  expressed  in  every  age; 
and  there  are  always  romantic  and  retrospective  per- 

23

THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


sons,  poets,  and  such  riff-raff,  who  look  back  to 
imaginary  “good  old  times.” 

It  is  the  mark  of  such  statements  that  they  seem 
to  satisfy  the  mind;  in  other  words,  it  is  the  mark  of 
such  thoughts  that  they  stop  us  from  thinking.  The 
man  who  has  thus  praised  progress  does  not  think 
it  necessary  to  progress  any  further.  The  man  who 
has  dismissed  a  complaint,  as  being  old,  does  not 
himself  think  it  necessary  to  say  anything  new.  He 
is  content  to  repeat  this  apology  for  existing  things; 
and  seems  unable  to  offer  any  more  thoughts  on  the 
subject.  Now,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  there  are  a  number 
of  further  thoughts  that  might  be  suggested  by  the 
subject.  Of  course,  it  is  quite  true  that  this  notion 
of  the  decline  of  a  state  has  been  suggested  in  many 
periods,  by  many  persons,  some  of  them,  unfor¬ 
tunately,  poets.  Thus,  for  instance,  Byron,  noto¬ 
riously  so  moody  and  melodramatic,  had  somehow  or 
other  got  it  into  his  head  that  the  Isles  of  Greece  were 
less  glorious  in  arts  and  arms  in  the  last  days  of  Turk¬ 
ish  rule  than  in  the  days  of  the  battle  of  Salamis  or 
the  Republic  of  Plato.  So  again  Wordsworth,  in  an 
equally  sentimental  fashion,  seems  to  insinuate  that 
the  Republic  of  Venice  was  not  quite  so  powerful 
when  Napoleon  trod  it  out  like  a  dying  ember  as  when 
its  commerce  and  art  filled  the  seas  of  the  world 
with  a  conflagration  of  colour.  So  many  writers  in 
the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries  have  even 
gone  so  far  as  to  suggest  that  modern  Spain  played  a 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  25 

less  predominant  part  than  Spain  in  the  days  of  the 
discovery  of  America  or  the  victory  of  Lepanto.  Some, 
even  more  lacking  in  that  Optimism  which  is  the 
soul  of  commerce,  have  made  an  equally  perverse 
comparison  between  the  earlier  and  the  later  con¬ 
ditions  of  the  commercial  aristocracy  of  Holland. 
Some  have  even  maintained  that  Tyre  and  Sidon 
are  not  quite  so  fashionable  as  they  used  to  be;  and 
somebody  once  said  something  about  “the  ruins  of 
Carthage.” 

In  somewhat  simpler  language,  we  may  say  that 
all  this  argument  has  a  very  big  and  obvious  hole 
in  it.  When  a  man  says,  “People  were  as  pessimistic 
as  you  are  in  societies  which  were  not  declining,  but 
were  even  advancing,”  it  is  permissible  to  reply,  “Yes, 
and  people  were  probably  as  optimistic  as  you  are 
in  societies  which  really  declined.”  For,  after  all, 
there  were  societies  which  really  declined.  It  is  true 
that  Horace  said  that  every  generation  seemed  to  be 
worse  than  the  last,  and  implied  that  Rome  was  going 
to  the  dogs,  at  the  very  moment  when  all  the  external 
world  was  being  brought  under  the  eagles.  But  it  is 
quite  likely  that  the  last  forgotten  court  poet,  prais¬ 
ing  the  last  forgotten  Augustulus  at  the  stiff  court  of 
Byzantium,  contradicted  all  the  seditious  rumours 
of  social  decline,  exactly  as  our  newspapers  do,  by  say¬ 
ing  that,  after  all,  Horace  had  said  the  same  thing. 
And  it  is  also  possible  that  Horace  was  right;  that  it 
was  in  his  time  that  the  turn  was  taken  which  led 


26  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

from  Horatius  on  the  bridge  to  Heracleius  in  the 
palace;  that  if  Rome  was  not  immediately  going  to 
the  dogs,  the  dogs  were  coming  to  Rome,  and  their  dis¬ 
tant  howling  could  first  be  heard  in  that  hour  of  the 
uplifted  eagles;  that  there  had  begun  a  long  advance 
that  was  also  a  long  decline,  but  ended  in  the  Dark 
Ages,  Rome  had  gone  back  to  the  Wolf. 

I  say  this  view  is  at  least  tenable,  though  it  does 
not  really  represent  my  own ;  but  it  is  quite  sufficiently 
reasonable  to  refuse  to  be  dismissed  with  the  cheap 
cheerfulness  of  the  current  maxim.  There  has  been, 
there  can  be,  such  a  thing  as  social  decline;  and  the 
only  question  is,  at  any  given  moment,  whether  By¬ 
zantium  had  declined  or  whether  Britain  is  declining. 
In  other  words,  we  must  judge  any  such  case  of  al¬ 
leged  degeneracy  on  its  own  merits.  It  is  no  answer  to 
say,  what  is,  of  course,  perfectly  true,  that  some 
people  are  naturally  prone  to  such  pessimism.  We 
are  not  judging  them,  but  the  situation  which  they 
judged  or  misjudged.  We  may  say  that  schoolboys 
have  always  disliked  having  to  go  to  school.  But 
there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  bad  school.  We  may  say 
the  farmers  always  grumble  at  the  weather.  But 
there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  bad  harvest.  And  we  have 
to  consider  as  a  question  of  the  facts  of  the  case,  and 
not  of  the  feelings  of  the  farmer,  whether  the  moral 
world  of  modern  England  is  likely  to  have  a  bad  har¬ 
vest. 

Now  the  reasons  for  regarding  the  present  prob- 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  27 

lem  of  Europe,  and  especially  of  England,  as  most 
menacing  and  tragic,  are  entirely  objective  reasons; 
and  have  nothing  to  do  with  this  alleged  mood  of 
melancholy  reaction.  The  present  system,  whether 
we  call  it  capitalism  or  anything  else,  especially  as  it 
exists  in  industrial  countries,  has  already  become  a 
danger;  and  is  rapidly  becoming  a  death-trap.  The 
evil  is  evident  in  the  plainest  private  experience  and 
in  the  coldest  economic  science.  To  take  the  practical 
test  first,  it  is  not  merely  alleged  by  the  enemies  of 
the  system,  but  avowed  by  the  defenders  of  it.  In 
the  Labour  disputes  of  our  time,  it  is  not  the  em¬ 
ployees  but  the  employers  who  declare  that  business 
is  bad.  The  successful  business  man  is  not  pleading 
success;  he  is  pleading  bankruptcy.  The  case  for 
Capitalists  is  the  case  against  Capitalism.  What  is 
even  more  extraordinary  is  that  its  exponent  has 
to  fall  back  on  the  rhetoric  of  Socialism.  He  merely 
says  that  miners  or  railwaymen  must  go  on  working 
“in  the  interests  of  the  public.”  It  will  be  noted  that 
the  capitalists  now  never  use  the  argument  of  private 
property.  They  confine  themselves  entirely  to  this 
sort  of  sentimental  version  of  general  social  respon¬ 
sibility.  It  is  amusing  to  read  the  capitalist  press  on 
Socialists  who  sentimentally  plead  for  people  who 
are  “failures.”  It  is  now  the  chief  argument  of  al¬ 
most  every  capitalist  in  every  strike  that  he  is  him¬ 
self  on  the  brink  of  failure. 

I  have  one  simple  objection  to  this  simple  argu- 


28  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

ment  in  the  papers  about  Strikes  and  the  Socialist 
peril.  My  objection  is  that  their  argument  leads 
straight  to  Socialism.  In  itself  it  cannot  possibly  lead 
to  anything  else.  If  workmen  are  to  go  on  working 
because  they  are  the  servants  of  the  public,  there 
cannot  be  any  deduction  except  that  they  ought  to  be 
the  servants  of  the  public  authority.  If  the  Govern¬ 
ment  ought  to  act  in  the  interests  of  the  public,  and 
there  is  no  more  to  be  said,  then  obviously  the  Govern¬ 
ment  ought  to  take  over  the  whole  business,  and 
there  is  nothing  else  to  be  done.  I  do  not  think  the 
matter  is  so  simple  as  this;  but  they  do.  I  do  not 
think  this  argument  for  Socialism  is  conclusive.  But 
according  to  the  Anti-Socialists  the  argument  for 
Socialism  is  quite  conclusive.  The  public  alone  is 
to  be  considered,  and  the  Government  can  do  any¬ 
thing  it  likes  so  long  as  it' considers  the  public.  Pre¬ 
sumably  it  can  disregard  the  liberty  of  the  employees 
and  force  them  to  work,  possibly  in  chains.  Presum¬ 
ably  also  it  can  disregard  the  property  of  the  em¬ 
ployers,  and  pay  the  proletariat  for  them,  if  necessary 
out  of  their  trouser-pockets.  All  these  consequences 
follow  from  the  highly  Bolshevist  doctrine  bawled 
at  us  every  morning  in  the  capitalist  press.  That  is 
all  they  have  to  say;  and  if  it  is  the  only  thing  to  be 
said,  then  the  other  is  the  only  thing  to  be  done. 

In  the  last  paragraph  it  is  noted  that  if  we  were 
left  to  the  logic  of  the  leader-writers  on  the  Socialist 
peril,  they  could  only  lead  us  straight  to  Socialism. 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  29 

And  as  some  of  us  most  heartily  and  vigorously  re¬ 
fuse  to  be  led  to  Socialism,  we  have  long  adopted  the 
harder  alternative  called  trying  to  think  things  out. 
And  we  shall  certainly  land  in  Socialism  or  in  some¬ 
thing  worse  called  Socialism,  or  else  in  mere  chaos 
and  ruin,  if  we  make  no  effort  to  see  the  situation  as 
a  whole  apart  from  our  immediate  irritations.  Now 
the  capitalist  system,  good  or  bad,  right  or  wrong, 
rests  upon  two  ideas:  that  the  rich  will  always  be 
rich  enough  to  hire  the  poor;  and  the  poor  will  always 
be  poor  enough  to  want  to  be  hired.  But  it  also  pre¬ 
sumes  that  each  side  is  bargaining  with  the  other, 
and  that  neither  is  thinking  primarily  of  the  public. 
The  owner  of  an  omnibus  does  not  run  it  for  the  good 
of  all  mankind,  despite  the  universal  fraternity  blaz¬ 
oned  in  the  Latin  name  of  the  vehicle.  He  runs  it  to 
make  a  profit  for  himself,  and  the  poorer  man  con¬ 
sents  to  drive  it  in  order  to  get  wages  for  himself. 
Similarly,  the  omnibus-conductor  is  not  filled  with  an 
abstract  altruistic  desire  for  the  nice  conduct  of  a 
crowded  omnibus  instead  of  a  clouded  cane.  He  does 
not  want  to  conduct  omnibuses  because  conduct  is 
three-fourths  of  life.  He  is  bargaining  for  the  biggest 
wage  he  can  get.  Now  the  case  for  capitalism  was  that 
through  this  private  bargain  the  public  did  really  get 
served.  And  so  for  some  time  it  did.  But  the  only 
original  case  for  capitalism  collapses  entirely,  if  we 
have  to  ask  either  party  to  go  on  for  the  good  of  the 
public.  If  capitalism  cannot  pay  what  will  tempt  men 


30  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

to  work,  capitalism  is  on  capitalist  principles  simply 
bankrupt.  If  a  tea-merchant  cannot  pay  clerks,  and 
cannot  import  tea  without  clerks,  then  his  business  is 
bust  and  there  is  an  end  of  it.  Nobody  in  the  old 
capitalist  conditions  said  the  clerks  were  bound  to 
work  for  less,  so  that  a  poor  old  lady  might  get  a 
cup  of  tea. 

So  it  is  really  the  capitalist  press  that  proves  on 
capitalist  principles  that  capitalism  has  come  to  an 
end.  If  it  had  not,  it  would  not  be  necessary  for 
them  to  make  the  social  and  sentimental  appeals 
they  do  make.  It  would  not  be  necessary  for  them 
to  appeal  for  the  intervention  of  the  Government 
like  Socialists.  It  would  not  have  been  necessary 
for  them  to  plead  the  discomfort  of  passengers 
like  sentimentalists  or  altruists.  The  truth  is  that 
everybody  has  now  abandoned  the  argument  on  which 
the  whole  of  the  old  capitalism  was  based:  the  argu¬ 
ment  that  if  men  were  left  to  bargain  individually 
the  public  would  benefit  automatically.  We  have  to 
find  a  new  basis  of  some  kind;  and  the  ordinary  Con¬ 
servatives  are  falling  back  on  the  Communist  basis 
without  knowing  it.  Now  I  respectfully  decline  to 
fall  back  on  the  Communist  basis.  But  I  am  sure  it 
is  perfectly  impossible  to  continue  to  fall  back  on  the 
old  Capitalist  basis.  Those  who  try  to  do  so  tie 
themselves  in  quite  impossible  knots.  The  most  prac¬ 
tical  and  pressing  affairs  of  the  hour  exhibit  the  con¬ 
tradiction  day  after  day.  For  instance,  when  some 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  31 

great  strike  or  lock-out  takes  place  in  a  big  business 
like  that  of  the  mines,  we  are  always  assured  that  no 
great  saving  could  be  achieved  by  cutting  out  private 
profits,  because  those  private  profits  are  now  neg¬ 
ligible  and  the  trade  in  question  is  not  now  greatly 
enriching  the  few.  Whatever  be  the  value  of  this  par¬ 
ticular  argument,  it  obviously  entirely  destroys  the 
general  argument.  The  general  argument  for  capital¬ 
ism  or  individualism  is  that  men  will  not  adventure 
unless  there  are  considerable  prizes  in  the  lottery.  It 
is  what  is  familiar  in  all  Socialistic  debates  as  the 
argument  of  “the  incentive  of  gain.”  But  if  there  is 
no  gain,  there  is  certainly  no  incentive.  If  royalty- 
owners  and  shareholders  only  get  a  little  insecure  or 
doubtful  profit  out  of  profiteering,  it  seems  as  if  they 
might  as  well  fall  to  the  lowly  estate  of  soldiers  and 
servants  of  society.  I  have  never  understood,  by  the 
way,  why  Tory  debaters  are  so  very  anxious  to  prove 
against  Socialism  that  “State  servants”  must  be  in¬ 
competent  and  inert.  Surely  it  might  be  left  to  others 
to  point  out  the  lethargy  of  Nelson  or  the  dull  routine 
of  Gordon. 

But  this  collapse  of  industrial  individualism,  which 
is  not  only  a  collapse  but  a  contradiction  (since  it 
has  to  contradict  all  its  own  commonest  maxims), 
is  not  only  an  accident  of  our  condition,  though  it  is 
most  marked  in  our  country.  Anybody  who  can  think 
in  theories,  those  highly  practical  things,  will  see 
that  sooner  or  later  this  paralysis  in  the  system  is  in- 


32  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

evitable.  Capitalism  is  a  contradiction;  it  is  even  a 
contradiction  in  terms.  It  takes  a  long  time  to  box  the 
compass,  and  a  still  longer  time  to  see  that  it  has 
done  so;  but  the  wheel  has  come  full  circle  now. 
Capitalism  is  contradictory  as  soon  as  it  is  complete; 
because  it  is  dealing  with  the  mass  of  men  in  two 
opposite  ways  at  once.  When  most  men  are  wage- 
earners,  it  is  more  and  more  difficult  for  most  men 
to  be  customers.  For  the  capitalist  is  always  trying 
to  cut  down  what  his  servant  demands,  and  in  doing 
so  is  cutting  down  what  his  customer  can  spend.  As 
soon  as  his  business  is  in  any  difficulties,  as  at  present 
in  the  coal  business,  he  tries  to  reduce  what  he  has  to 
spend  on  wages,  and  in  doing  so  reduces  what  others 
have  to  spend  on  coal.  He  is  wanting  the  same  man 
to  be  rich  and  poor  at  the  same  time.  This  contradic¬ 
tion  in  capitalism  does  not  appear  in  the  earlier  stages, 
because  there  are  still  populations  not  reduced  to  the 
common  proletarian  condition.  But  as  soon  as  the 
wealthy  as  a  whole  are  employing  the  wage-earners 
as  a  whole,  this  contradiction  stares  them  in  the  face 
like  an  ironic  doom  and  judgment.  Employer  and 
employee  are  simplified  and  solidified  to  the  relation 
of  Robinson  Crusoe  and  Man  Friday.  Robinson  Cru¬ 
soe  may  say  he  has  two  problems:  the  supply  of 
cheap  labour  and  the  prospect  of  trade  with  the  na¬ 
tives.  But  as  he  is  dealing  in  these  two  different  ways 
with  the  same  man,  he  will  get  into  a  muddle.  Robin¬ 
son  Crusoe  may  possibly  force  Friday  to  work  for 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  33 

nothing  but  his  bare  keep,  the  white  man  possessing 
all  the  weapons.  As  in  the  Geddes  parallel,  he  may 
economize  with  an  Axe.  But  he  cannot  cut  down  Fri¬ 
day’s  salary  to  nothing  and  then  expect  Friday  to 
give  him  gold  and  silver  and  orient  pearls  in  return 
for  rum  and  rifles.  Now  in  proportion  as  capitalism 
covers  the  whole  earth,  links  up  large  populations, 
and  is  ruled  by  centralized  systems,  the  nearer  and 
nearer  approaches  this  resemblance  to  the  lonely  fig¬ 
ures  on  the  remote  island.  If  the  trade  with  the  na¬ 
tives  is  really  going  down,  so  as  to  necessitate  the 
wages  of  the  natives  also  going  down,  we  can  only 
say  that  the  case  is  rather  more  tragic  if  the  excuse 
is  true  than  if  it  is  false.  We  can  only  say  that  Cru¬ 
soe  is  now  indeed  alone,  and  that  Friday  is  unques¬ 
tionably  unlucky. 

I  think  it  very  important  that  people  should  under¬ 
stand  that  there  is  a  principle  at  work  behind  the 
industrial  troubles  of  England  in  our  time;  and  that, 
whoever  be  right  or  wrong  in  any  particular  quarrel, 
it  is  no  particular  person  or  party  who  is  responsible 
for  our  commercial  experiment  being  faced  with 
failure.  It  is  a  vicious  circle  into  which  wage-earning 
society  will  finally  sink  when  it  begins  to  lose  profits 
and  lower  wages;  and  though  some  industrial  coun¬ 
tries  are  still  rich  enough  to  remain  ignorant  of  the 
strain,  it  is  only  because  their  progress  is  incomplete; 
when  they  reach  the  goal  they  will  find  the  riddle. 
In  our  own  country,  which  concerns  most  of  us  most, 


34 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


we  are  already  falling  into  that  vicious  circle  of  sink¬ 
ing  wages  and  decreasing  demand.  And  as  I  am  going 
to  suggest  here,  in  however  sketchy  a  manner,  the  line 
of  escape  from  this  slowly  closing  snare,  and  because 
I  know  some  of  the  things  that  are  commonly  said 
about  any  such  suggestion,  I  have  a  reason  for  re¬ 
minding  the  reader  of  all  these  things  at  this  stage. 

“Safe!  Of  course  it’s  not  safe!  It’s  a  beggarly  chance 
to  cheat  the  gallows.”  Such  was  the  intemperate  ex¬ 
clamation  of  Captain  Wicks  in  the  romance  of 
Stevenson;  and  the  same  romancer  has  put  a  some¬ 
what  similar  piece  of  candour  into  the  mouth  of  Alan 
Breck  Stewart.  “But  mind  you,  it’s  no  small  thing! 
ye  maun  lie  bare  and  hard  .  .  .  and  ye  shall  sleep 
with  your  hand  upon  your  weapons.  Aye,  man,  ye 
shall  taigle  many  a  weary  foot  or  we  get  clear.  I  tell 
ye  this  at  the  start,  for  it’s  a  life  that  I  ken  well.  But  if 
ye  ask  what  other  chance  you  have,  I  answer;  Nane.” 

And  I  myself  am  sometimes  tempted  to  talk  in  this 
abrupt  manner,  after  listening  to  long  and  thoughtful 
disquisitions  throwing  doubt  on  the  detailed  per¬ 
fection  of  a  Distributist  State,  as  compared  with  the 
rich  happiness  and  final  repose  that  crowns  the  pres¬ 
ent  Capitalist  and  Industrial  State.  People  ask  us 
how  we  should  deal  with  the  unskilled  labour  at  the 
docks,  and  what  we  have  to  offer  to  replace  the  radiant 
popularity  of  Lord  Devonport  and  the  permanent 
industrial  peace  of  the  Port  of  London.  Those  who 
ask  us  what  we  shall  do  with  the  docks  seldom  seem 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  35 

to  ask  themselves  what  the  docks  will  do  with  them¬ 
selves,  if  our  commerce  steadily  declines  like  that  of 
so  many  commercial  cities  in  the  past.  Other  people 
ask  us  how  we  should  deal  with  workmen  holding 
shares  in  a  business  that  might  possibly  go  bankrupt. 
It  never  occurs  to  them  to  answer  their  own  question, 
in  a  capitalist  state  in  which  business  after  business  is 
going  bankrupt.  We  have  got  to  deal  with  the  smallest 
and  most  remote  possibilities  of  our  more  simple  and 
static  society,  while  they  do  not  deal  with  the  biggest 
and  most  blatant  facts  about  their  own  complex  and 
collapsing  one.  They  are  inquisitive  about  the  de¬ 
tails  of  our  scheme,  and  wish  to  arrange  beforehand  a 
science  of  casuistry  for  all  the  exceptions.  But  they 
dare  not  look  their  own  systems  in  the  face,  where 
ruin  has  become  the  rule.  Other  people  wish  to  know 
whether  a  machine  would  be  permitted  to  exist  in 
this  or  that  position  in  our  Utopia;  as  an  exhibit  in 
a  museum,  or  a  toy  in  the  nursery,  or  a  “torture  im¬ 
plement  of  the  twentieth  century”  show'n  in  the 
Chamber  of  Horrors.  But  those  who  ask  us  so  anx¬ 
iously  how  men  are  to  work  without  machines  do  not 
tell  us  how  machines  are  to  work  if  men  do  not  work 
them,  or  how  either  machines  or  men  are  to  work  if 
there  is  no  work  to  do.  They  are  so  eager  to  dis¬ 
cover  the  weak  points  in  our  proposal  that  they  have 
not  yet  discovered  any  strong  points  in  their  own 
practice.  Strange  that  our  vain  and  sentimental  vision 
should  be  so  vivid  to  these  realists  that  they  can 


36  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

see  its  every  detail;  and  that  their  own  reality  should 
be  so  vague  to  them  that  they  cannot  see  it  at  all ;  that 
they  cannot  see  the  most  obvious  and  overwhelming 
fact  about  it:  that  it  is  no  longer  there. 

For  it  is  one  of  the  grim  and  even  grisly  jokes  of 
the  situation  that  the  very  complaint  they  always 
make  of  us  is  specially  and  peculiarly  true  of  them. 
They  are  always  telling  us  that  we  think  we  can 
bring  back  the  past,  or  the  barbarous  simplicity  and 
superstition  of  the  past;  apparently  under  the  im¬ 
pression  that  we  want  to  bring  back  the  ninth  cen¬ 
tury.  But  they  do  really  think  they  can  bring  back 
the  nineteenth  century.  They  are  always  telling  us 
that  this  or  that  tradition  has  gone  for  ever,  that  this 
or  that  craft  or  creed  has  gone  for  ever;  but  they 
dare  not  face  the  fact  that  their  own  vulgar  and 
huckstering  commerce  has  gone  for  ever.  They  call 
us  reactionaries  if  we  talk  of  a  Revival  of  Faith  or  a 
Revival  of  Catholicism.  But  they  go  on  calmly  plas¬ 
tering  their  papers  with  the  headline  of  a  Revival  of 
Trade.  What  a  cry  out  of  the  distant  past!  What  a 
voice  from  the  tomb!  They  have  no  reason  whatever 
for  believing  that  there  will  be  a  revival  of  trade, 
except  that  their  great-grandfathers  would  have  found 
it  impossible  to  believe  in  a  decline  of  trade.  They 
have  no  conceivable  ground  for  supposing  that  we 
shall  grow  richer,  except  that  our  ancestors  never 
prepared  us  for  the  prospect  of  growing  poorer.  Yet 
it  is  they  who  are  always  blaming  us  for  depending 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  37 

on  a  sentimental  tradition  of  the  wisdom  of  our 
ancestors.  It  is  they  who  are  always  rejecting  social 
ideals  merely  because  they  were  the  social  ideals  of 
some  former  age.  They  are  always  telling  us  that  the 
mill  will  never  grind  again  the  water  that  is  past; 
without  noticing  that  their  own  mills  are  already 
idle  and  grinding  nothing  at  all — like  ruined  mills 
in  some  watery  Early  Victorian  landscape  suitable 
to  their  watery  Early  Victorian  quotation.  They  are 
always  telling  us  that  we  are  fighting  against  the 
tide  of  time,  as  Mrs.  Partington  with  a  mop  fought 
against  the  tide  of  the  sea.  And  they  cannot  even  see 
that  time  itself  has  made  Mrs.  Partington  as  an¬ 
tiquated  a  figure  as  Mother  Shipton.  They  are  always 
telling  us  that  in  resisting  capitalism  and  commercial¬ 
ism  we  are  like  Canute  rebuking  the  waves;  and  they 
do  not  even  know  that  the  England  of  Cobden  is 
already  as  dead  as  the  England  of  Canute.  They  are 
always  seeking  to  overwhelm  us  in  the  water-floods, 
to  sweep  us  away  upon  these  weary  and  washy  meta¬ 
phors  of  tide  and  time;  for  all  the  world  as  if  they 
could  call  back  the  rivers  that  have  left  our  cities  so 
far  behind,  or  summon  back  the  seven  seas  to  their 
allegiance  to  the  trident;  or  bridle  again,  with  gold 
for  the  few  and  iron  for  the  many,  the  roaring  river 
of  the  Clyde. 

We  may  well  be  tempted  to  the  exclamation  of 
Captain  Wicks.  We  are  not  choosing  between  a  pos¬ 
sible  peasantry  and  a  successful  commerce.  We  are 


38  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

choosing  between  a  peasantry  that  might  succeed  and 
a  commerce  that  has  already  failed.  We  are  not  seek¬ 
ing  to  lure  men  away  from  a  thriving  business  to  a 
sort  of  holiday  in  Arcadia  or  the  peasant  type  of 
Utopia.  We  are  trying  to  make  suggestions  about 
starting  anew  after  a  bankrupt  business  has  really 
gone  bankrupt.  We  can  see  no  possible  reason  for 
supposing  that  English  trade  will  regain  its  nine¬ 
teenth-century  predominance,  except  mere  Vic¬ 
torian  sentimentalism  and  that  particular  sort  of 
lying  which  the  newspapers  call  “optimism.”  They 
taunt  us  for  trying  to  bring  back  the  conditions  of 
the  Middle  Ages;  as  if  we  were  trying  to  bring  back 
the  bows  or  the  body-armour  of  the  Middle  Ages. 
Well,  helmets  have  come  back;  and  body-armour  may 
come  back;  and  bows  and  arrows  will  have  to  come 
back,  a  long  time  before  there  is  any  return  of  that 
fortunate  moment  on  whose  luck  they  live.  It  is 
quite  as  likely  that  the  long  bow  will  be  found  through 
some  accident  superior  to  the  rifle  as  that  the  battle¬ 
ship  will  be  able  any  longer  to  rule  the  waves  with¬ 
out  reference  to  the  aeroplane.  The  commercial  sys¬ 
tem  implied  the  security  of  our  commercial  routes; 
and  that  implied  the  superiority  of  our  national  navy. 
Everybody  who  faces  facts  knows  that  aviation  has 
altered  the  whole  theory  of  that  naval  security.  The 
whole  huge  horrible  problem  of  a  big  population  on 
a  small  island  dependent  on  insecure  imports  is  a 
problem  quite  as  much  for  Capitalists  and  Collect- 


THE  PERIL  OF  THE  HOUR  39 

ivists  as  for  Distributists.  We  are  not  choosing  be¬ 
tween  model  villages  as  part  of  a  serene  system  of 
town-planning.  We  are  making  a  sortie  from  a  be¬ 
sieged  city,  sword  in  hand;  a  sortie  from  the  ruin  of 
Carthage.  "Safe!  Of  course  it’s  not  safe!”  said  Captain 
Wicks. 

I  think  it  is  not  unlikely  that  in  any  case  a  simpler 
social  life  will  return;  even  if  it  return  by  the  road  of 
ruin.  I  think  the  soul  will  find  simplicity  again,  if 
it  be  in  the  Dark  Ages.  But  we  are  Christians  and  con¬ 
cerned  with  the  body  as  well  as  the  soul ;  we  are  Eng¬ 
lishmen  and  we  do  not  desire,  if  we  can  help  it,  that 
the  English  people  should  be  merely  the  People  of 
the  Ruins.  And  we  do  most  earnestly  desire  a  serious 
consideration  of  whether  the  transition  cannot  be 
made  in  the  light  of  reason  and  tradition;  whether 
we  cannot  yet  do  deliberately  and  well  what  nemesis 
will  do  wastefully  and  without  pity;  whether  we  can¬ 
not  build  a  bridge  from  these  slippery  downward 
slopes  to  freer  and  firmer  land  beyond,  without  con¬ 
senting  yet  that  our  most  noble  nation  must  descend 
into  that  valley  of  humiliation  in  which  nations  dis¬ 
appear  from  history.  For  this  purpose,  with  great 
conviction  of  our  principles  and  with  no  shame  of 
being  open  to  argument  about  their  application,  we 
have  called  our  companions  to  council.

THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY 

Once  upon  a  time,  or  conceivably  even  more  than 
once,  there  was  a  man  who  went  into  a  public-house 
and  asked  for  a  glass  of  beer.  I  will  not  mention  his 
name,  for  various  and  obvious  reasons;  it  may  be  libel 
nowadays  to  say  this  about  a  man;  or  it  may  lay 
him  open  to  police  prosecution  under  the  more  hu¬ 
mane  laws  of  our  day.  So  far  as  this  first  recorded 
action  is  concerned,  his  name  may  have  been  any¬ 
thing:  William  Shakespeare  or  Geoffrey  Chaucer  or 
Charles  Dickens  or  Henry  Fielding,  or  any  of  those 
common  names  that  crop  up  everywhere  in  the  popu¬ 
lace.  The  important  thing  about  him  is  that  he  asked 
for  a  glass  of  beer.  The  still  more  important  thing 
about  him  is  that  he  drank  it;  and  the  most  important 
thing  of  all  is  that  he  spat  it  out  again  (I  regret  to 
say)  and  threw  the  pewter  mug  at  the  publican.  For 
the  beer  was  abominably  bad. 

True,  he  had  not  yet  submitted  it  to  any  chemical 
analysis;  but,  after  he  had  drank  a  little  of  it,  he  felt 
an  inward,  a  very  inward,  persuasion  that  there  was 
something  wrong  about  it.  When  he  had  been  ill  for 
a  week,  steadily  getting  worse  all  the  time,  he  took 
some  of  the  beer  to  the  Public  Analyst;  and  that 

40 


THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY  41 

learned  man,  after  boiling  it,  freezing  it,  turning  it 
green,  blue,  and  yellow,  and  so  on,  told  him  that  it 
did  indeed  contain  a  vast  quantity  of  deadly  poison. 
“To  continue  drinking  it,”  said  the  man  of  science 
thoughtfully,  “will  undoubtedly  be  a  course  attended 
with  risks,  but  life  is  inseparable  from  risk.  And  be¬ 
fore  you  decide  to  abandon  it,  you  must  make  up 
your  mind  what  Substitute  you  propose  to  put  into 
your  inside,  in  place  of  the  beverage  which  at  present 
(more  or  less)  reposes  there.  If  you  will  bring  me  a 
list  of  your  selections  in  this  difficult  matter,  I  will 
willingly  point  out  the  various  scientific  objections 
that  can  be  raised  to  all  of  them.” 

The  man  went  away,  and  became  more  and  more 
ill;  and  indeed  he  noticed  that  nobody  else  seemed 
to  be  really  well.  As  he  passed  the  tavern,  his  eye 
chanced  to  fall  upon  various  friends  of  his  writhing 
in  agony  on  the  ground,  and  indeed  not  a  few  of 
them  lying  dead  and  stiff  in  heaps  about  the  road. 
To  his  simple  mind  this  seemed  a  matter  of  some  con¬ 
cern  to  the  community;  so  he  hurried  to  a  police 
court  and  laid  before  a  magistrate  a  complaint  against 
the  inn.  “It  would  indeed  appear,”  said  the  Justice 
of  the  Peace,  “that  the  house  you  mention  is  one  in 
which  people  are  systematically  murdered  by  means 
of  poison.  But  before  you  demand  so  drastic  a  course 
as  that  of  pulling  it  down  or  even  shutting  it  up,  you 
have  to  consider  a  problem  of  no  little  difficulty. 
Have  you  considered  precisely  what  building  you 


42  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

would  Put  In  Its  Place,  whether  a - .”  At  this  point 

I  regret  to  say  that  the  man  gave  a  loud  scream  and 
was  forcibly  removed  from  the  court  announcing  that 
he  was  going  mad.  Indeed,  this  conviction  of  his 
mental  malady  increased  with  his  bodily  malady;  to 
such  an  extent  that  he  consulted  a  distinguished  Doc¬ 
tor  of  Psychology  and  Psycho-Analysis,  who  said  to 
him  confidentially,  “As  a  matter  of  diagnosis,  there 
can  be  no  doubt  that  you  are  suffering  from  Bink’s 
Aberration;  but  when  we  come  to  treatment  I  may 
say  frankly  that  it  is  very  difficult  to  find  anything 
to  take  the  place  of  that  affliction.  Have  you  con¬ 
sidered  what  is  the  alternative  to  madness - ?” 

Whereupon  the  man  sprang  up  waving  his  arms  and 
cried,  “There  is  none.  There  is  no  alternative  to  mad¬ 
ness.  It  is  inevitable.  It  is  universal.  We  must  make 
the  best  of  it.” 

So  making  the  best  of  it,  he  killed  the  doctor  and 
then  went  back  and  killed  the  magistrate  and  the 
public  analyst,  and  is  now  in  an  asylum,  as  happy 
as  the  day  is  long. 

In  the  fable  appearing  above  the  case  is  propounded 
which  is  primarily  necessary  to  see  at  the  start  of  a 
sketch  of  social  renewal.  It  concerned  a  gentleman 
who  was  asked  what  he  would  substitute  for  the 
poison  that  had  been  put  into  his  inside,  or  what 
constructive  scheme  he  had  to  put  in  place  of  the 
den  of  assassins  that  had  poisoned  him.  A  similar 
demand  is  made  of  those  of  us  who  regard  plutoc- 


THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY  43 

racy  as  a  poison  or  the  present  plutocratic  state  as 
something  like  a  den  of  thieves.  In  the  parable  of 
the  poison  it  is  possible  that  the  reader  may  share 
some  of  the  impatience  of  the  hero.  He  will  say  that 
nobody  would  be  such  a  fool  as  not  to  get  rid  of 
prussic  acid  or  professional  criminals,  merely  because 
there  were  differences  of  opinion  about  the  course  of 
action  that  would  follow  getting  rid  of  them.  But  I 
would  ask  the  reader  to  be  a  little  more  patient,  not 
only  with  me  but  with  himself;  and  ask  himself  why 
it  is  that  we  act  with  this  promptitude  in  the  case  of 
poison  and  crime.  It  is  not,  even  here,  really  because 
we  are  indifferent  to  the  substitute.  We  should  not 
regard  one  poison  as  an  antidote  to  the  other  poison, 
if  it  made  the  malady  worse.  We  should  not  set  a 
thief  to  catch  a  thief,  if  it  really  increased  the  amount 
of  thieving.  The  principle  upon  which  we  are  acting, 
even  if  we  are  acting  too  quickly  to  think,  or  think¬ 
ing  too  quickly  to  define,  is  nevertheless  a  principle 
that  we  could  define.  If  we  merely  give  a  man  an 
emetic  after  he  has  taken  a  poison,  it  is  not  because 
we  think  he  can  live  on  emetics  any  more  than  he 
can  live  on  poisons.  It  is  because  we  think  that  after 
he  has  first  recovered  from  the  poison,  and  then  re¬ 
covered  from  the  emetic,  there  will  come  a  time  when 
he  himself  will  think  he  would  like  a  little  ordinary 
food.  That  is  the  starting-point  of  the  whole  specula¬ 
tion,  so  far  as  we  are  concerned.  If  certain  impedi¬ 
ments  are  removed,  it  is  not  so  much  a  question  of 


44  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

what  we  would  do  as  of  what  he  would  do.  So  if  we 
save  the  lives  of  a  number  of  people  from  the  den  of 
poisoners,  we  do  not  at  that  moment  ask  what  they 
will  do  with  their  lives.  We  assume  that  they  will  do 
something  a  little  more  sensible  than  taking  poison. 
In  other  words,  the  very  simple  first  principle  upon 
which  all  such  reforms  rest,  is  that  there  is  some 
tendency  to  recovery  in  every  living  thing  if  we  re¬ 
move  the  pressure  of  an  immediate  peril  or  pain. 
Now  at  the  beginning  of  all  this  rough  outline  of  a 
social  reform,  which  I  propose  to  trace  here,  I  wish 
to  make  clear  this  general  principle  of  recovery,  with¬ 
out  which  it  will  be  unintelligible.  We  believe  that  if 
things  were  released  they  would  recover;  but  we  also 
believe  (and  this  is  very  important  in  the  practical 
question)  that  if  things  even  begin  to  be  released, 
they  will  begin  to  recover.  If  the  man  merely  leaves 
off  drinking  the  bad  beer,  his  body  will  make  some 
effort  to  recover  its  ordinary  condition.  If  the  man 
merely  escapes  from  those  who  are  slowly  poisoning 
him,  to  some  extent  the  very  air  he  breathes  will  be 
an  antidote  to  his  poison. 

As  I  hope  to  explain  in  the  essays  that  follow,  I 
think  the  question  of  the  real  social  reform  divides 
itself  into  two  distinct  stages  and  even  ideas.  One 
is  arresting  a  race  towards  mad  monopoly  that  is 
K  already  going  on,  reversing  that  revolution  and  re¬ 
turning  to  something  that  is  more  or  less  normal, 
but  by  no  means  ideal;  the  other  is  trying  to  inspire 


THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY  45 

that  more  normal  society  with  something  that  is  in 
a  real  sense  ideal,  though  not  necessarily  merely 
Utopian.  But  the  first  thing  to  be  understood  is  that 
any  relief  from  the  present  pressure  will  probably 
have  more  moral  effect  than  most  of  our  critics 
imagine.  Hitherto  all  the  triumphs  have  been  tri¬ 
umphs  of  plutocratic  monopoly;  all  the  defeats  have 
been  defeats  of  private  property.  I  venture  to  guess 
that  one  real  defeat  of  a  monopoly  would  have  an 
instant  and  incalculable  effect,  far  beyond  itself,  like 
the  first  defeats  in  the  field  of  a  military  empire  like 
Prussia  parading  itself  as  invincible.  As  each  group 
or  family  finds  again  the  real  experience  of  private 
property,  it  will  become  a  centre  of  influence,  a  mis¬ 
sion.  What  we  are  dealing  with  is  not  a  question  of 
a  General  Election  to  be  counted  by  a  calculating 
machine.  It  is  a  question  of  a  popular  movement,  that 
never  depends  on  mere  numbers. 

That  is  why  we  have  so  often  taken,  merely  as  a 
working  model,  the  matter  of  a  peasantry.  The  point 
about  a  peasantry  is  that  it  is  not  a  machine,  as  prac¬ 
tically  every  ideal  social  state  is  a  machine;  that  is, 
a  thing  that  will  work  only  as  it  is  set  down  to  work 
in  the  pattern.  You  make  laws  for  a  Utopia;  it  is  only 
by  keeping  thbse  laws  that  it  can  be  kept  a  Utopia. 
You  do  not  make  laws  for  a  peasantry.  You  make  a 
peasantry;  and  the  peasants  make  the  laws.  I  do  not 
mean,  as  will  be  clear  enough  when  I  come  to  more 
detailed  matters,  that  laws  must  not  be  used  for  the 


46 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


establishment  of  a  peasantry  or  even  for  the  protec¬ 
tion  of  it.  But  I  mean  that  the  character  of  a  peasantry 
does  not  depend  on  laws.  The  character  of  a  peasan¬ 
try  depends  on  peasants.  Men  have  remained  side  by 
side  for  centuries  in  their  separate  and  fairly  equal 
farms,  without  many  of  them  losing  their  land,  with¬ 
out  any  of  them  buying  up  the  bulk  of  the  land.  Yet 
very  often  there  was  no  law  against  their  buying 
up  the  bulk  of  the  land.  Peasants  could  not  buy  be¬ 
cause  peasants  would  not  sell.  That  is,  this  form  of 
moderate  equality,  when  once  it  exists,  is  not  merely 
a  legal  formula;  it  is  also  a  moral  and  psychological 
fact.-People  behave  when  they  find  themselves  in  that 
position  as  they  do  when  they  find  themselves  at 
home.  That  is,  they  stay  there;  or  at  least  they  be¬ 
have  normally  there.  There  is  nothing  in  abstract 
logic  to  prove  that  people  cannot  thus  feel  at  home  in 
a  Socialist  Utopia.  But  the  Socialists  who  describe 
Utopias  generally  feel  themselves  in  some  dim  way 
that  people  will  not;  and  that  is  why  they  have  to 
make  their  mere  laws  of  economic  control  so  elaborate 
and  so  clear.  They  use  their  army  of  officials  to  move 
men  about  like  crowds  of  captives,  from  old  quar¬ 
ters  to  new  quarters,  and  doubtless  to  better  quar¬ 
ters.  But  we  believe  that  the  slaves  that  we  free  will 
fight  for  us  like  soldiers. 

In  other  words,  all  that  I  ask  in  this  preliminary 
note  is  that  the  reader  should  understand  that  we 
are  trying  to  make  something  that  will  run  of  it- 


THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY  47 

self.  A  machine  will  not  run  of  itself.  A  man  will 
run  of  himself;  even  if  he  runs  into  a  good  many 
things  that  he  would  have  been  wiser  to  avoid. 
When  freed  from  certain  disadvantages,  he  can  to 
some  extent  take  over  the  responsibility.  All  schemes 
of  collective  concentration  have  in  them  the  character 
of  controlling  the  man  even  when  he  is  free;  if  you 
will,  of  controlling  him  to  keep  him  free.  They  have 
the  idea  that  the  man  will  not  be  poisoned  if  he  has 
a  doctor  standing  behind  his  chair  at  dinner-time, 
to  check  the  mouthfuls  and  measure  the  wine.  We 
have  the  idea  that  the  man  may  need  a  doctor  when 
he  is  poisoned,  but  no  longer  needs  him  when  he  is 
unpoisoned.  We  do  not  say,  as  they  possibly  do 
say,  that  he  will  always  be  perfectly  happy  or  per¬ 
fectly  good;  because  there  are  other  elements  in 
life  besides  the  economic;  and  even  the  economic  is 
affected  by  original  sin.  We  do  not  say  that  because 
he  does  not  need  a  doctor  he  does  not  need  a  priest 
or  a  wife  or  a  friend  or  a  God;  or  that  his  relations 
to  these  things  can  be  ensured  by  any  social  scheme. 
But  we  do  say  that  there  is  something  which  is  much 
more  real  and  much  more  reliable  than  any  social 
scheme;  and  that  is  a  society. VThere  is  such  a  thing 
as  people  finding  a  social  life  that  suits  them  and 
enables  them  to  get  on  reasonably  well  with  each 
other.  You  do  not  have  to  wait  till  you  have  estab¬ 
lished  that  sort  of  society  everywhere.  It  makes  all 
the  difference  so  soon  as  you  have  established  it 


48  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

anywhere.  So  if  I  am  told  at  the  start:  “You  do 
not  think  Socialism  of  reformed  Capitalism  will  save 
England;  do  you  really  think  Distributism  will  save 
England?”  I  answer,  “No;  I  think  Englishmen  will 
save  England,  if  they  begin  to  have  half  a  chance.” 

I  am  therefore  in  this  sense  hopeful;  I  believe  that 
the  breakdown  has  been  a  breakdown  of  machinery 
and  not  of  men.  And  I  fully  agree,  as  I  have  just  ex¬ 
plained,  that  leaving  work  for  a  man  is  very  differ¬ 
ent  from  leaving  a  plan  for  a  machine.  I  ask  the  reader 
to  realize  this  distinction,  at  this  stage  of  the  de¬ 
scription,  before  I  go  on  to  describe  more  definitely 
some  of  the  possible  directions  of  reform.  I  am  not  at 
all  ashamed  of  being  ready  to  listen  to  reason;  I  am 
not  at  all  afraid  of  leaving  matters  open  to  adjust¬ 
ment;  I  am  not  at  all  annoyed  at  the  prospect  of 
those  who  carry  out  these  principles  varying  in  many 
ways  in  their  programmes.  I  am  much  too  much  in 
earnest  to  treat  my  own  programme  as  a  party  pro¬ 
gramme;  or  to  pretend  that  my  private  bill  must  be¬ 
come  an  Act  of  Parliament  without  any  amend¬ 
ments.  But  I  have  a  particular  cause,  in  this  par¬ 
ticular  case,  for  insisting  in  this  chapter  that  there 
is  a  reasonable  chance  of  escape;  and  for  asking  that 
the  reasonable  chance  should  be  considered  with  rea¬ 
sonable  cheerfulness.  I  do  not  care  very  much  for 
that  sort  of  American  virtue  which  is  now  sometimes 
called  optimism.  It  has  too  much  of  the  flavour  of 
Christian  Science  to  be  a  comfortable  thing  for 


49 


THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY 

Christians.  But  I  do  feel,  in  the  facts  of  this  par¬ 
ticular  case,  that  there  is  a  reason  for  warning  people 
against  a  too  hasty  exhibition  of  pessimism  and  the 
pride  of  impotence.  I  do  ask  everybody  to  consider, 
in  a  free  and  open  fashion,  whether  something  of  the 
sort  here  indicated  cannot  be  carried  out,  even  if  it 
be  carried  out  differently  in  detail;  for  it  is  a  matter 
of  the  understanding  of  men.  The  position  is  much 
too  serious  for  men  to  be  anything  but  cheerful.  And 
in  this  connection  I  would  venture  to  utter  a  warn¬ 
ing. 

A  man  has  been  led  by  a  foolish  guide  or  a  self- 
confident  fellow-traveller  to  the  brink  of  a  precipice, 
which  he  might  well  have  fallen  over  in  the  dark. 
It  may  well  be  said  that  there  is  nothing  to  be  done 
but  to  sit  down  and  wait  for  the  light.  Still,  it 
might  be  well  to  pass  the  hours  of  darkness  in  some 
discussion  about  how  it  will*  be  best  for  them  to 
make  their  way  backwards  to  more  secure  ground; 
and  the  recollection  of  any  facts  and  the  formulation 
of  any  coherent  plan  of  travel  will  not  be  waste  of 
time,  especially  if  there  is  nothing  else  to  do.  But 
there  is  one  piece  of  advice  which  we  should  be  in¬ 
clined  to  give  to  the  guide  who  has  misguided  the 
simple  stranger — especially  if  he  is  a  really  simple 
stranger,  a  man  perhaps  of  rude  education  and  ele¬ 
mentary  emotions.  We  should  strongly  advise  him 
not  to  beguile  the  time  by  proving  conclusively  that 
it  is  impossible  to  go  back,  that  there  is  no  really 


50  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

secure  ground  behind,  that  there  is  no  chance  of  find¬ 
ing  the  homeward  path  again,  that  the  steps  recently 
taken  are  irrevocable,  and  that  progress  must  go 
forward  and  can  never  return.  If  he  is  a  tactful  man, 
in  spite  of  his  previous  error,  he  will  avoid  this  tone 
in  conversation.  If  he  is  not  a  tactful  man,  it  is  not 
altogether  impossible  that  before  the  end  of  the  con¬ 
versation,  somebody  will  go  over  the  precipice  after 
all;  and  it  will  not  be  the  simple  stranger. 

An  army  has  marched  across  a  wilderness,  its 
column,  in  the  military  phrase,  in  the  air;  under 
a  confident  commander  who  is  certain  he  will  pick 
up  new  communications  which  will  be  far  better  than 
the  old  ones.  When  the  soldiers  are  almost  worn 
out  with  marching,  and  the  rank  and  file  of  them 
have  suffered  horrible  privations  from  hunger  and 
exposure,  they  find  they  have  only  advanced  un¬ 
supported  into  a  hostile  country;  and  that  the 
signs  of  military  occupation  to  be  seen  on  every  side 
are  only  those  of  an  enemy  closing  round.  The 
march  is  suddenly  halted  and  the  commander  ad¬ 
dresses  his  men.  There  are  a  great  many  things  that 
he  may  say.  Some  may  hold  that  he  had  much  bet¬ 
ter  say  nothing  at  all.  Many  may  hold  that  the  less 
he  says  the  better.  Others  may  urge,  very  truly, 
that  courage  is  even  more  needed  for  a  retreat  than 
for  an  advance.  He  may  be  advised  to  rouse  his  dis¬ 
appointed  men  by  threatening  the  enemy  with  a 
more  dramatic  disappointment;  by  declaring  that 


51 


THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY 

they  will  best  him  yet;  that  they  will  dash  out  of 
the  net  even  as  it  is  thrown,  and  that  their  escape 
will  be  far  more  victorious  than  his  victory.  But 
anyhow  there  is  one  kind  of  speech  which  the  com¬ 
mander  will  not  make  to  his  men,  unless  he  is  much 
more  of  a  fool  than  his  original  blunder  proves  him. 
He  will  not  say:  “We  have  now  taken  up  a  position 
which  may  appear  to  you  very  depressing;  but  I 
assure  you  it  is  nothing  to  the  depression  which  you 
will  certainly  suffer  as  you  make  a  series  of  in¬ 
evitably  futile  attempts  to  improve  it,  or  to  fall 
back  on  what  you  may  foolishly  regard  as  a  stronger 
position.  I  am  very  much  amused  at  your  absurd 
suggestions  for  getting  back  to  our  old  communica¬ 
tions;  for  I  never  thought  much  of  your  mangy  old 
communications  anyhow.”  There  have  been  mutinies 
in  the  desert  before  now;  and  it  is  possible  that  the 
general  will  not  be  killed  in  battle  with  the  enemy. 

A  great  nation  and  civilization  has  followed  for 
a  hundred  years  or  more  a  form  of  progress  which 
held  itself  independent  of  certain  old  communica¬ 
tions,  in  the  form  of  ancient  traditions  about  the 
land,  the  hearth,  or  the  altar.  It  has  advanced  un¬ 
der  leaders  who  were  confident,  not  to  say  cocksure. 
They  were  quite  sure  that  their  economic  rules  were 
rigid,  that  their  political  theory  was  right,  that  their 
commerce  was  beneficent,  that  their  parliaments 
were  popular,  that  their  press  was  enlightened,  that 
their  science  was  humane.  In  this  confidence  they 


52

committed  their  people  to  certain  new  and  enormous 
experiments;  to  making  their  own  independent  na¬ 
tion  an  eternal  debtor  to  a  few  rich  men;  to  piling 
up  private  property  in  heaps  on  the  faith  of  finan¬ 
ciers;  to  covering  their  land  with  iron  and  stone  and 
stripping  it  of  grass  and  grain;  to  driving  food  out 
of  their  own  country  in  the  hope  of  buying  it  back 
again  from  the  ends  of  the  earth;  to  loading  up 
their  little  island  with  iron  and  gold  till  it  was 
weighted  like  a  sinking  ship;  to  letting  the  rich  grow 
richer  and  fewer  and  the  poor  poorer  and  more  num¬ 
erous;  to  letting  the  whole  world  be  cloven  in  two 
with  a  war  of  mere  masters  and  mere  servants;  to  los¬ 
ing  every  type  of  moderate  prosperity  and  candid 
patriotism,  till  there  was  no  independence  without 
luxury  and  no  labour  without  ugliness;  to  leaving  the 
millions  of  mankind  dependent  on  indirect  and  dis¬ 
tant  discipline  and  indirect  and  distant  sustenance, 
working  themselves  to  death  for  they  knew  not  whom 
and  taking  the  means  of  life  from  they  knew  not 
where;  and  all  hanging  on  a  thread  of  alien  trade 
which  grew  thinner  and  thinner.  To  the  people  who 
have  been  brought  into  this  position  many  things 
may  still  be  said.  It  will  be  right  to  remind  them  that 
mere  wild  revolt  will  make  things  worse  and  not  bet¬ 
ter.  It  may  be  true  to  say  that  certain  complexities 
must  be  tolerated  for  a  time  because  they  correspond 
to  other  complexities,  and  the  two  must  be  carefully 
simplified  together.  But  if  I  may  say  one  word  to

THE  CHANCE  OF  RECOVERY 

the  princes  and  rulers  of  such  a  people,  who  have  led 
them  into  such  a  pass,  I  would  say  to  them  as  seri¬ 
ously  as  anything  was  ever  said  by  man  to  men:  “For 
God’s  sake,  for  our  sake,  but,  above  all,  for  your 
own  sake,  do  not  be  in  this  blind  haste  to  tell  them 
there  is  no  way  out  of  the  trap  into  which  your  folly 
has  led  them;  that  there  is  no  road  except  the  road 
by  which  you  have  brought  them  to  ruin;  that  there 
is  710  progress  except  the  progress  that  has  ended  here. 
Do  not  be  so  eager  to  prove  to  your  hapless  victims 
that  what  is  hapless  is  also  hopeless.  Do  not  be  so 
anxious  to  convince  them,  now  that  you  are  at  the 
end  of  your  experiment,  that  you  are  also  at  the  end 
of  your  resources.  Do  not  be  so  very  eloquent,  so 
very  elaborate,  so  very  rational  and  radiantly  con¬ 
vincing  in  proving  that  your  own  error  is  even  more 
irrevocable  and  irremediable  than  it  is.  Do  not  try 
to  minimize  the  industrial  disease  by  showing  it  is 
an  incurable  disease.  Do  not  brighten  the  dark  prob¬ 
lem  of  the  coal-pit  by  proving  it  is  a  bottomless  pit. 
Do  not  tell  the  people  there  is  no  way  but  this;  for 
many  even  now  will  not  endure  this.  Do  not  say  to 
men  that  this  alone  is  possible;  for  many  already 
think  it  impossible  to  bear.  And  at  some  later  time, 
at  some  eleventh  hour,  when  the  fates  have  grown 
darker  and  the  ends  have  grown  clearer,  the  mass  of 
men  may  suddenly  understand  into  what  a  blind 
alley  your  progress  has  led  them.  Then  they  may  turn 
on  you  in  the  trap.  And  if  they  bore  all  else,  they

might  not  bear  the  final  taunt  that  you  can  do  noth¬ 
ing;  that  you  will  not  even  try  to  do  anything.  'What 
art  thou,  man,  and  why  art  thou  despairing?'  wrote 
the  poet.  ‘God  shall  forgive  thee  all  but  thy  despair.’ 
Man  also  may  forgive  you  for  blundering  and  may 
not  forgive  you  for  despairing.”

ON  A  SENSE  OF  PROPORTION 

Those  of  us  who  study  the  papers  and  the  par¬ 
liamentary  speeches  with  proper  attention  must  have 
by  this  time  a  fairly  precise  idea  of  the  nature  of  the 
evil  of  Socialism.  It  is  a  remote  Utopian  dream  im¬ 
possible  of  fulfilment  and  also  an  overwhelming 
practical  danger  that  threatens  us  at  every  moment. 
It  is  only  a  thing  that  is  as  distant  as  the  end  of  the 
world  and  as  near  as  the  end  of  the  street.  All  that 
is  clear  enough;  but  the  aspect  of  it  that  arrests  me 
at  this  moment  is  more  especially  the  Utopian  as¬ 
pect.  A  person  who  used  to  write  in  the  Daily  Mail 
paid  some  attention  to  this  aspect;  and  represented 
this  social  ideal,  or  indeed  almost  any  other  social 
ideal,  as  a  sort  of  paradise  of  poltroons.  He  suggested 
that  “weaklings”  wished  to  be  protected  from  the 
strain  and  stress  of  our  vigorous  individualism,  and 
so  cried  out  for  this  paternal  government  or  grand¬ 
motherly  legislation.  And  it  was  while  I  was  reading 
his  remarks,  with  a  deep  and  never-failing  enjoyment, 
that  the  image  of  the  Individualist  rose  before  me;  of 
the  sort  of  man  who  probably  writes  such  remarks 
and  certainly  reads  them. 

The  reader  refolds  the  Daily  Mail  and  rises  from

his  intensely  individualistic  breakfast-table,  where 
he  has  just  dispatched  his  bold  and  adventurous 
breakfast;  the  bacon  cut  in  rashers  from  the  wild 
boar  which  but  lately  turned  to  bay  in  his  back 
garden;  the  eggs  perilously  snatched  from  swaying 
nest  and  flapping  bird  at  the  top  of  those  toppling 
trees  which  gave  the  house  its  appropriate  name  of 
Pine  Crest.  He  puts  on  his  curious  and  creative 
hat,  built  on  some  bold  plan  entirely  made  up  out  of 
his  own  curious  and  creative  head.  He  walks  outside 
his  unique  and  unparalleled  house,  also  built  with 
his  own  well-won  wealth  according  to  his  own  well- 
conceived  architectural  design,  and  seeming  by  its 
very  outline  against  the  sky  to  express  his  own  pas¬ 
sionate  personality.  He  strides  down  the  street,  mak¬ 
ing  his  own  way  over  hill  and  dale  towards  the  place 
of  his  own  chosen  and  favourite  labour,  the  workshop 
of  his  imaginative  craft.  He  lingers  on  the  way,  now 
to  pluck  a  flower,  now  to  compose  a  poem,  for  his 
time  is  his  own;  he  is  an  individual  and  a  free  man 
and  not  as  these  Communists.  He  can  work  at  his 
own  craft  when  he  will,  and  labour  far  into  the  night 
to  make  up  for  an  idle  morning.  Such  is  the  life  of 
the  clerk  in  a  world  of  private  enterprise  and  prac¬ 
tical  individualism;  such  the  manner  of  his  free  pas¬ 
sage  from  his  home.  He  continues  to  stride  lightly 
along,  until  he  sees  afar  off  the  picturesque  and  strik¬ 
ing  tower  of  that  workshop  in  which  he  will,  as  with 
the  creative  strokes  of  a  god  .  .  „

He  sees  it,  I  say,  afar  off.  The  expression  is  not 
wholly  accidental.  For  that  is  exactly  the  defect  in 
all  that  sort  of  journalistic  philosophy  of  individual¬ 
ism  and  enterprise;  that  those  things  are  at  present 
even  more  remote  and  improbable  than  communal 
visions.  It  is  not  the  dreadful  Bolshevist  republic 
that  is  afar  off.  It  is  not  the  Socialistic  State  that  is 
Utopian.  In  that  sense,  it  is  not  even  Utopia  that  is 
Utopian.  The  Socialist  State  may  in  one  sense  be 
very  truly  described  as  terribly  and  menacingly  near. 
The  Socialist  State  is  exceedingly  like  the  Capital¬ 
ist  State,  in  which  the  clerk  reads  and  the  journalist 
writes.  Utopia  is  exactly  like  the  present  state  of  af¬ 
fairs,  only  worse. 

It  would  make  no  difference  to  the  clerk  if  his  job 
became  a  part  of  a  Government  department  to¬ 
morrow.  He  would  be  equally  civilized  and  equally 
uncivic  if  the  distant  and  shadowy  person  at  the 
head  of  the  department  were  a  Government  official. 
Indeed,  it  does  make  very  little  difference  to  him 
now,  whether  he  or  his  sons  and  daughters  are  em¬ 
ployed  at  the  Post  Office  on  bold  and  revolutionary 
Socialistic  principles  or  employed  at  the  Stores  on 
wild  and  adventurous  Individualist  principles.  I  never 
heard  of  anything  resembling  civil  war  between  the 
daughter  at  the  Stores  and  the  daughter  in  the  Post 
Office.  I  doubt  whether  the  young  lady  at  the  Post 
Office  is  so  imbued  with  Bolshevist  principles  that 
she  would  think  it  a  part  of  the  Higher  Morality  to 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


58 

expropriate  something  without  payment  off  the  coun¬ 
ter  of  the  Stores.  I  doubt  whether  the  young  lady 
at  the  Stores  shudders  when  she  passes  a  red  pillar 
box,  seeing  in  it  an  outpost  of  the  Red  Peril. 

What  is  really  a  long  way  off  is  this  individuality 
and  liberty  the  Daily  Mail  praised.  It  is  the  tower 
that  a  man  has  built  for  himself  that  is  seen  in 
the  distance.  It  is  Private  Enterprise  that  is  Utopian, 
in  the  sense  of  something  as  distant  as  Utopia.  It  is 
Private  Property  that  is  for  us  an  ideal  and  for  our 
critics  an  impossibility.  It  is  that  which  can  really  be 
discussed  almost  exactly  as  the  writer  in  the  Daily 
Mail  discusses  Collectivism.  It  is  that  which  some 
people  consider  a  goal  and  some  people  a  mirage.  It 
is  that  which  its  friends  maintain  to  be  the  final  satis¬ 
faction  of  modern  hopes  and  hungers,  and  its  ene¬ 
mies  maintain  to  be  a  contradiction  to  common  sense 
and  common  human  possibilities.  All  the  controver¬ 
sialists  who  have  become  conscious  of  the  real  issue 
are  already  saying  of  our  ideal  exactly  what  used  to 
be  said  of  the  Socialists’  ideal.  They  are  saying  that 
private  property  is  too  ideal  not  to  be  impossible. 
They  are  saying  that  private  enterprise  is  too  good 
to  be  true.  They  are  saying  that  the  idea  of  ordinary 
men  owning  ordinary  possessions  is  against  the  laws 
of  political  economy  and  requires  an  alteration  in 
human  nature.  They  are  saying  that  all  practical 
business  men  know  that  the  thing  would  never  work, 
exactly  as  the  same  obliging  people  are  always  pre- 


ON  A  SENSE  OF  PROPORTION  59 

pared  to  know  that  State  management  would  never 
work.  For  they  hold  the  simple  and  touching  faith 
that  no  management  except  their  own  could  ever 
work.  They  call  this  the  law  of  nature;  and  they 
call  anybody  who  ventures  to  doubt  it  a  weakling. 
But  the  point  to  see  is  that,  although  the  normal 
solution  of  private  property  for  all  is  even  now  not 
very  widely  realized,  in  so  far  as  it  is  realized  by 
the  rulers  of  the  modern  market  (and  therefore  of 
the  modern  world)  it  is  to  this  normal  notion  of 
property  that  they  apply  the  same  criticism  as  they 
applied  to  the  abnormal  notion  of  Communism.  They 
say  it  is  Utopian;  and  they  are  right.  They  say  it 
is  idealistic;  and  they  are  right.  They  say  it  is  quix¬ 
otic;  and  they  are  right.  It  deserves  every  name  that 
will  indicate  how  completely  they  have  driven  jus¬ 
tice  out  of  the  world;  every  name  that  will  measure 
how  remote  from  them  and  their  sort  is  the  standard 
of  honourable  living;  every  name  that  will  emphasize 
and  repeat  the  fact  that  property  and  liberty  are 
sundered  from  them  and  theirs,  by  an  abyss  between 
heaven  and  hell. 

That  is  the  real  issue  to  be  fought  out  with  our 
serious  critics;  and  I  have  written  here  a  series  of 
articles  dealing  more  directly  with  it.  It  is  the  ques¬ 
tion  of  whether  this  ideal  can  be  anything  but  an 
ideal;  not  the  question  of  whether  it  is  to  be  con¬ 
founded  with  the  present  contemptible  reality.  It  is 
simply  the  question  of  whether  this  good  thing  is 


60  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

really  too  good  to  be  true.  For  the  present  I  will 
merely  say  that  if  the  pessimists  are  convinced  of 
their  pessimism,  if  the  sceptics  really  hold  that  our 
social  ideal  is  now  banished  for  ever  by  mechanical 
difficulties  or  materialistic  fate,  they  have  at  least 
reached  a  remarkable  and  curious  conclusion.  It  is 
hardly  stranger  to  say  that  man  will  have  henceforth 
to  be  separated  from  his  arms  and  legs,  owing  to 
the  improved  pattern  of  wheels,  than  to  say  that 
he  must  for  ever  say  farewell  to  two  supports  so 
natural  as  the  sense  of  choosing  for  himself  and  of 
owning  something  of  his  own.  These  critics,  whether 
they  figure  as  critics  of  Socialism  or  Distributism, 
are  very  fond  of  talking  about  extravagant  stretches 
of  the  imagination  or  impossible  strains  upon  human 
nature.  1  confess  I  have  to  stretch  and  strain  my 
own  human  imagination  and  human  nature  very  far, 
to  conceive  anything  so  crooked  and  uncanny  as  the 
human  race  ending  with  a  complete  forgetfulness  of 
the  possessive  pronoun. 

Nevertheless,  as  we  say,  it  is  with  these  critics  we 
are  in  controversy.  Distribution  may  be  a  dream; 
three  acres  and  a  cow  may  be  a  joke;  cows  may  be 
fabulous  animals;  liberty  may  be  a  name;  private 
enterprise  may  be  a  wild  goose  chase  on  which  the 
world  can  go  no  further.  But  as  for  the  people  who 
talk  as  if  property  and  private  enterprise  were  the 
principles  now  in  operation — those  people  are  so  blind 
and  deaf  and  dead  to  all  the  realities  of  their  own 


ON  A  SENSE  OF  PROPORTION  61 

daily  existence,  that  they  can  be  dismissed  from  the 
debate. 

In  this  sense,  therefore,  we  are  indeed  Utopian; 
in  the  sense  that  our  task  is  possibly  more  distant 
and  certainly  more  difficult.  We  are  more  revolu¬ 
tionary  in  the  sense  that  a  revolution  means  a  re¬ 
versal:  a  reversal  of  direction,  even  if  it  were  accom¬ 
panied  with  a  restraint  upon  pace.  The  world  we 
want  is  much  more  different  from  the  existing  world 
than  the  existing  world  is  different  from  the  world 
of  Socialism.  Indeed,  as  has  been  already  noted, 
there  is  not  much  difference  between  the  present  world 
and  Socialism;  except  that  we  have  left  out  the  less 
important  and  more  ornamental  notions  of  Social¬ 
ism,  such  additional  fancies  as  justice,  citizenship, 
the  abolition  of  hunger,  and  so  on.  We  have  already 
accepted  anything  that  anybody  of  intelligence  ever 
disliked  in  Socialism.  We  have  everything  that  critics 
used  to  complain  of  in  the  desolate  utility  and  unity 
of  Looking  Backward.  In  so  far  as  the  world  of  Wells 
or  Webb  was  criticized  as  a  centralized,  impersonal, 
and  monotonous  civilization,  that  is  an  exact  descrip¬ 
tion  of  existing  civilization.  Nothing  has  been  left  out 
but  some  idle  fancies  about  feeding  the  poor  or  giv¬ 
ing  rights  to  the  populace.  In  every  other  way  the 
unification  and  regimentation  is  already  complete. 
Utopia  has  done  its  worst.  Capitalism  has  done  all 
that  Socialism  threatened  to  do.  The  clerk  has  exactly 
the  sort  of  passive  functions  and  permissive  pleasures 


62 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


that  he  would  have  in  the  most  monstrous  model 
village.  I  do  not  sneer  at  him;  he  has  many  intelligent 
tastes  and  domestic  virtues  in  spite  of  the  civilization 
he  enjoys.  They  are  exactly  the  tastes  and  virtues  he 
could  have  as  a  tenant  and  servant  of  the  State.  But 
from  the  moment  he  wakes  up  to  the  moment  he  goes 
to  sleep  again,  his  life  is  run  in  grooves  made  for  him 
by  other  people,  and  often  other  people  he  will  never 
even  know.  He  lives  in  a  house  that  he  does  not  own, 
that  he  did  not  make,  that  he  does  not  want.  He  moves 
everywhere  in  ruts;  he  always  goes  up  to  his  work 
on  rails.  He  has  forgotten  what  his  fathers,  the  hunt¬ 
ers  and  the  pilgrims  and  the  wandering  minstrels, 
meant  by  finding  their  way  to  a  place.  He  thinks  in 
terms  of  wages;  that  is,  he  has  forgotten  the  real 
meaning  of  wealth.  His  highest  ambition  is  con¬ 
cerned  with  getting  this  or  that  subordinate  post  in 
a  business  that  is  already  a  bureaucracy.  There  is  a 
certain  amount  of  competition  for  that  post  inside 
that  business;  but  so  there  would  be  inside  any 
bureaucracy.  This  is  a  point  that  the  apologists  of 
monopoly  often  miss.  They  sometimes  plead  that 
even  in  such  a  system  there  may  still  be  a  competition 
among  servants;  presumably  a  competition  in  servil¬ 
ity.  But  so  there  might  be  after  Nationalization,  when 
they  were  all  Government  servants.  The  whole  ob¬ 
jection  to  State  Socialism  vanishes,  if  that  is  an  an¬ 
swer  to  the  objection.  If  every  shop  were  as  thoroughly 
nationalized  as  a  police  station,  it  would  not  prevent 


ON  A  SENSE  OF  PROPORTION  63 

the  pleasing  virtues  of  jealousy,  intrigue,  and  selfish 
ambition  from  blooming  and  blossoming  among 
them,  as  they  sometimes  do  even  among  policemen. 

Anyhow,  that  world  exists;  and  to  challenge  that 
world  may  be  called  Utopian;  to  change  that  world 
may  be  called  insanely  Utopian.  In  that  sense  the 
name  may  be  applied  to  me  and  those  who  agree 
with  me,  and  we  shall  not  quarrel  with  it.  But  in  an¬ 
other  sense  the  name  is  highly  misleading  and  par¬ 
ticularly  inappropriate.  The  word  "Utopia”  implies 
not  only  difficulty  of  attainment  but  also  other 
qualities  attached  to  it  in  such  examples  as  the 
Utopia  of  Mr.  Wells.  And  it  is  essential  to  explain 
at  once  why  they  do  not  attach  to  our  Utopia — if  it 
is  a  Utopia. 

There  is  such  a  thing  as  what  we  should  call  ideal 
Distributism;  though  we  should  not,  in  this  vale  of 
tears,  expect  Distributism  to  be  ideal.  In  the  same 
sense  there  certainly  is  such  a  thing  as  ideal  Com¬ 
munism.  But  there  is  no  such  thing  as  ideal  Capital¬ 
ism;  and  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  Capitalist  ideal. 
As  we  have  already  noticed  (though  it  has  not  been 
noticed  often  enough),  whenever  the  capitalist  does 
become  an  idealist,  and  specially  when  he  does  be¬ 
come  a  sentimentalist,  he  always  talks  like  a  Social¬ 
ist.  He  always  talks  about  "social  service”  and  our 
common  interests  in  the  whole  community.  From  this 
it  follows  that  in  so  far  as  such  a  man  is  likely  to 
have  such  a  thing  as  a  Utopia,  it  will  be  more  or  less 


64 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


in  the  style  of  a  Socialist  Utopia.  The  successful 
financier  can  put  up  with  an  imperfect  world,  whether 
or  no  he  has  the  Christian  humility  to  recognize  him¬ 
self  as  one  of  its  imperfections.  But  if  he  is  called 
upon  to  conceive  a  perfect  world,  it  will  be  something 
in  the  way  of  the  pattern  state  of  the  Fabians  or  the 
I.L.P.  He  will  look  for  something  systematized,  some¬ 
thing  simplified,  something  all  on  the  same  plan.  And 
he  will  not  get  it;  at  least  he  will  not  get  it  from  me. 
It  is  exactly  from  that  simplification  and  sameness 
that  I  pray  to  be  saved,  and  should  be  proud  if  I 
could  save  anybody.  It  is  exactly  from  that  order 
and  unity  that  I  call  on  the  name  of  Liberty  to  de¬ 
liver  us. 

\  We  do  not  offer  perfection;  what  we  offer  is  pro¬ 
portion.  We  wish  to  correct  the  proportions  of  the 
modern  state;  but  proportion  is  between  varied 
things;  and  a  proportion  is  hardly  ever  a  pattern. 
It  is  as  if  we  were  drawing  the  picture  of  a  living  man 
and  they  thought  we  were  drawing  a  diagram  of 
wheels  and  rods  for  the  construction  of  a  Robot. 
We  do  not  propose  that  in  a  healthy  society  all  land 
should  be  held  in  the  same  way;  or  that  all  property 
should  be  owned  on  the  same  conditions;  or  that 
all  citizens  should  have  the  same  relation  to  the  city. 
It  is  our  whole  point  that  the  central  power  needs 
lesser  powers  to  balance  and  check  it,  and  that  these 
must  be  of  many  kinds:  some  individual,  some  com¬ 
munal,  some  official,  and  so  on.  Some  of  them  will 


ON  A  SENSE  OF  PROPORTION  65 

probably  abuse  their  privilege;  but  we  prefer  the  risk 
to  that  of  the  State  or  of  the  Trust,  which  abuses  its 
omnipotence. 

For  instance,  I  am  sometimes  blamed  for  not  be¬ 
lieving  in  my  own  age,  or  blamed  still  more  for  be¬ 
lieving  in  my  own  religion.  I  am  called  medieval; 
and  some  have  even  traced  in  me  a  bias  in  favour 
of  the  Catholic  Church  to  which  I  belong.  But  sup¬ 
pose  we  were  to  take  a  parallel  from  these  things. 
If  anyone  said  that  medieval  kings  or  modern  peas¬ 
ant  countries  were  to  blame  for  tolerating  patches 
of  avowed  Bolshevism,  we  should  be  rather  surprised 
if  we  found  that  the  remark  really  referred  to  their 
tolerating  monasteries.  Yet  it  is  quite  true  in  one 
sense  that  monasteries  are  devoted  to  Communism 
and  that  monks  are  all  Communists.  Their  economic 
and  ethical  life  is  an  exception  to  a  general  civiliza¬ 
tion  of  feudalism  or  family  life.  Yet  their  privileged 
position  was  regarded  as  rather  a  prop  of  social 
order.  They  give  to  certain  communal  ideas  their 
proper  and  proportionate  place  in  the  State;  and 
something  of  the  same  thing  was  true  of  the  Common 
Land.  We  should  welcome  the  chance  of  allowing  any 
guilds  or  groups  of  a  communal  colour  their  proper 
and  proportionate  place  in  the  State;  we  should  be 
perfectly  willing  to  mark  off  some  part  of  the  land  as 
Common  Land.  What  we  say  is  that  merely  national¬ 
izing  all  the  land  is  like  merely  making  monks  of  all 
the  people;  it  is  giving  those  ideals  more  than  their 


66  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

proper  and  proportionate  place  in  the  State.  The 
ordinary  meaning  of  Communism  is  not  that  some 
people  are  Communists,  but  that  all  people  are  Com¬ 
munists.  But  we  should  not  say,  in  the  same  hard  and 
literal  sense,  that  the  meaning  of  Distributism  is  that 
all  people  are  Distributists.  We  certainly  should  not 
say  that  the  meaning  of  a  peasant  state  is  that  all 
people  are  peasants.  We  should  mean  that  it  had  the 
general  character  of  a  peasant  state;  that  the  land  was 
largely  held  in  that  fashion  and  the  law  generally  di¬ 
rected  in  that  spirit;  that  any  other  institutions 
stood  up  as  recognizable  exceptions,  as  landmarks 
on  that  high  tableland  of  equality. 

If  this  is  inconsistent,  nothing  is  consistent;  if  this 
is  unpractical,  all  human  life  in  unpractical.  If  a  man 
wants  what  he  calls  a  flower-garden  he  plants  flowers 
where  he  can,  and  especially  where  they  will  deter¬ 
mine  the  general  character  of  the  landscape  garden¬ 
ing.  But  they  do  not  completely  cover  the  garden; 
they  only  positively  colour  it.  He  does  not  expect 
roses  to  grow  in  the  chimney-pots,  or  daisies  to  climb 
up  the  railings;  still  less  does  he  expect  tulips  to  grow 
on  the  pine,  or  the  monkey  tree  to  blossom  like  a 
rhododendron.  But  he  knows  perfectly  well  what  he 
means  by  a  flower-garden;  and  so  does  everybody 
else.  If  he  does  not  want  a  flower-garden  but  a 
kitchen-garden,  he  proceeds  differently.  But  he  does 
not  expect  a  kitchen-garden  to  be  exactly  like  a 
kitchen.  He  does  not  dig  out  all  the  potatoes,  because 


67 


ON  A  SENSE  OF  PROPORTION 

it  is  not  a  flower-garden  and  the  potato  has  a  flower. 
He  knows  the  main  thing  he  is  trying  to  achieve;  but, 
not  being  a  born  fool,  he  does  not  think  he  can  achieve 
it  everywhere  in  exactly  the  same  degree,  or  in  a  man¬ 
ner  equally  unmixed  with  things  of  another  sort.  The 
flower-gardener  will  not  banish  nasturtiums  to  the 
kitchen-garden  because  some  strange  people  have 
been  known  to  eat  them.  Nor  will  the  other  class  a 
vegetable  as  a  flower  because  it  is  called  a  cauli¬ 
flower.  So,  from  our  social  garden,  we  should  not 
necessarily  exclude  every  modern  machine  any  more 
than  we  should  exclude  every  medieval  monastery. 
And  indeed  the  apologue  is  appropriate  enough;  for 
this  is  the  sort  of  elementary  human  reason  that 
men  never  lost  until  they  lost  their  gardens:  just  as 
that  higher  reason  that  is  more  than  human  was  lost 
with  a  garden  long  ago.

SOME  ASPECTS  OF  BIG  BUSINESS 


1.  The  Bluff  of  the  Big  Shops 

2.  A  Misunderstanding  about  Method 

3.  A  Case  in  Point 

4.  The  Tyranny  of  Trusts

THE  BLUFF  OF  THE  BIG  SHOPS 

Twice  in  my  life  has  an  editor  told  me  in  so  many 
words  that  he  dared  not  print  what  I  had  written, 
because  it  would  offend  the  advertisers  in  his  paper. 
The  presence  of  such  pressure  exists  everywhere  in  a 
more  silent  and  subtle  form.  But  I  have  a  great  re¬ 
spect  for  the  honesty  of  this  particular  editor;  for  it 
was  evidently  as  near  to  complete  honesty  as  the 
editor  of  an  important  weekly  magazine  can  possibly 
go.  He  told  the  truth  about  the  falsehood  he  had  to 
tell. 

On  both  those  occasions  he  denied  me  liberty  of 
expression  because  I  said  that  the  widely  advertised 
stores  and  large  shops  were  really  worse  than  little 
shops.  That,  it  may  be  interesting  to  note,  is  one  of 
the  things  that  a  man  is  now  forbidden  to  say;  per¬ 
haps  the  only  thing  he  is  really  forbidden  to  say.  If  it 
had  been  an  attack  on  Government,  it  would  have 
been  tolerated.  If  it  had  been  an  attack  on  God,  it 
would  have  been  respectfully  and  tactfully  ap¬ 
plauded.  If  I  had  been  abusing  marriage  or  patriot¬ 
ism  or  public  decency,  I  should  have  been  heralded 
in  headlines  and  allowed  to  sprawl  across  Sunday 

newspapers.  But  the  big  newspaper  is  not  likely  to 

71 


72  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

attack  the  big  shop;  being  itself  a  big  shop  in  its  way 
and  more  and  more  a  monument  of  monopoly.  But  it 
will  be  well  if  I  repeat  here  in  a  book  what  I  found 
it  impossible  to  repeat  in  an  article.  I  think  the  big 
shop  is  a  bad  shop.  I  think  it  bad  not  only  in  a  moral 
but  a  mercantile  sense;  that  is,  I  think  shopping  there 
is  not  only  a  bad  action  but  a  bad  bargain.  I  think 
the  monster  emporium  is  not  only  vulgar  and  inso¬ 
lent,  but  incompetent  and  uncomfortable;  and  I  deny 
that  its  large  organization  is  efficient.  Large  organiza¬ 
tion  is  loose  organization.  Nay,  it  would  be  almost 
as  true  to  say  that  organization  is  always  disorgan¬ 
ization.  The  only  thing  perfectly  organic  is  an  organ¬ 
ism;  like  that  grotesque  and  obscure  organism  called 
a  man.  He  alone  can  be  quite  certain  of  doing  what 
he  wants;  beyond  him,  every  extra  man  may  be  an 
extra  mistake.  As  applied  to  things  like  shops,  the 
whole  thing  is  an  utter  fallacy.  Some  things  like 
armies  have  to  be  organized;  and  therefore  do  their 
very  best  to  be  well  organized.  You  must  have  a 
long  rigid  line  stretched  out  to  guard  a  frontier;  and 
therefore  you  stretch  it  tight.  But  it  is  not  true  that 
you  must  have  a  long  rigid  line  of  people  trimming 
hats  or  tying  bouquets,  in  order  that  they  may  be 
trimmed  or  tied  neatly.  The  work  is  much  more  likely 
to  be  neat  if  it  is  done  by  a  particular  craftsman  for 
a  particular  customer  with  particular  ribbons  and 
flowers.  The  person  told  to  trim  the  hat  will  never  do 
it  quite  suitably  to  the  person  who  wants  it  trimmed; 


THE  BLUFF  OF  THE  BIG  SHOPS  73 

and  the  hundredth  person  told  to  do  it  will  do  it 
badly;  as  he  does.  If  we  collected  all  the  stories  from 
all  the  housewives  and  householders  about  the  big 
shops  sending  the  wrong  goods,  smashing  the  right 
goods,  forgetting  to  send  any  sort  of  goods,  we  should 
behold  a  welter  of  inefficiency.  There  are  far  more 
blunders  in  a  big  shop  than  ever  happen  in  a  small 
shop,  where  the  individual  customer  can  curse  the 
individual  shopkeeper.  Confronted  with  modern  ef¬ 
ficiency  the  customer  is  silent;  well  aware  of  that 
organization’s  talent  for  sacking  the  wrong  man.  In 
short,  organization  is  a  necessary  evil — which  in  this 
case  is  not  necessary. 

I  have  begun  these  notes  with  a  note  on  the  big 
shops  because  they  are  things  near  to  us  and  familiar 
to  us  all.  I  need  not  dwell  on  other  and  still  more 
entertaining  claims  made  for  the  colossal  combina¬ 
tion  of  departments.  One  of  the  funniest  is  the  state¬ 
ment  that  it  is  convenient  to  get  everything  in  the 
same  shop.  That  is  to  stay,  it  is  convenient  to  walk 
the  length  of  the  street,  so  long  as  you  walk  indoors, 
or  more  frequently  underground,  instead  of  walking 
the  same  distance  in  the  open  air  from  one  little  shop 
to  another.  The  truth  is  that  the  monopolists’  shops 
are  really  very  convenient — to  the  monopolist.  They 
have  all  the  advantage  of  concentrating  business  as 
they  concentrate  wealth,  in  fewer  and  fewer  of  the 
citizens.jTheir  wealth  sometimes  permits  them  to  pay 
tolerable  wages;  their  wealth  also  permits  them  to 


74 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


buy  up  better  businesses  and  advertise  worse  goods. 
But  that  their  own  goods  are  better  nobody  has  ever 
even  begun  to  show;  and  most  of  us  know  any  num¬ 
ber  of  concrete  cases  where  they  are  definitely  worse. 
Now  I  expressed  this  opinion  of  my  own  (so  shocking 
to  the  magazine  editor  and  his  advertisers)  not  only 
because  it  is  an  example  of  my  general  thesis  that 
small  properties  should  be  revived,  but  because  it  is 
essential  to  the  realization  of  another  and  much  more 
curious  truth.  It  concerns  the  psychology  of  all  these 
things:  of  mere  size,  of  mere  wealth,  of  mere  adver¬ 
tisement  and  arrogance.  And  it  gives  us  the  first  work¬ 
ing  model  of  the  way  in  which  things  are  done  to-day 
and  the  way  in  which  (please  God)  they  may  be  un¬ 
done  to-morrow. 

There  is  one  obvious  and  enormous  and  entirely 
neglected  general  fact  to  be  noted  before  we  con¬ 
sider  the  laws  chiefly  needed  to  renew  the  State.  And 
that  is  the  fact  that  one  considerable  revolution  could 
be  made  without  any  laws  at  all.  It  does  not  concern 
any  existing  law,  but  rather  an  existing  superstition. 
And  the  curious  thing  is  that  its  upholders  boast  that 
it  is  a  superstition.  The  other  day  I  saw  and  very 
thoroughly  enjoyed  a  popular  play  called  It  Pays  to 
Advertise;  which  is  all  about  a  young  business  man 
who  tries  to  break  up  the  soap  monopoly  of  his  fa¬ 
ther,  a  more  old-fashioned  business  man,  by  the  wild¬ 
est  application  of  American  theories  of  the  psychol¬ 
ogy  of  advertising.  One  thing  that  struck  me  as  rather 


THE  BLUFF  OF  THE  BIG  SHOPS  75 

interesting  about  it  was  this.  It  was  quite  good  com¬ 
edy  to  give  the  old  man  and  the  young  man  our  sym¬ 
pathy  in  turn.  It  was  quite  good  farce  to  make  the 
oldman  and  the  young  man  each  alternately  look  a 
fool.  But  nobody  seemed  to  feel  what  I  felt  to  be  the 
most  outstanding  and  obvious  points  of  folly.  They 
scoffed  at  the  old  man  because  he  was  old;  because 
he  was  old-fashioned;  because  he  himself  was  healthy 
enough  to  scoff  at  the  monkey  tricks  of  their  mad  ad¬ 
vertisements.  But  nobody  really  criticized  him  for 
having  made  a  corner,  for  which  he  might  once  have 
stood  in  a  pillory.  Nobody  seemed  to  have  enough 
instinct  for  independence  and  human  dignity  to  be 
irritated  at  the  idea  that  one  purse-proud  old  man 
could  prevent  us  all  from  having  an  ordinary  human 
commodity  if  he  chose.  And  as  with  the  old  man,  so 
it  was  with  the  young  man.  He  had  been  taught  by 
his  American  friend  that  advertisement  can  hypno¬ 
tize  the  human  brain;  that  people  are  dragged  by  a 
deadly  fascination  into  the  doors  of  a  shop  as  into 
the  mouth  of  a  snake;  that  the  subconscious  is  cap¬ 
tured  and  the  will  paralysed  by  repetition;  that  we 
are  all  made  to  move  like  mechanical  dolls  when  a 
Yankee  advertiser  says,  “Do  It  Now.”  But  it  never 
seemed  to  occur  to  anybody  to  resent  this.  Nobody 
seemed  sufficiently  alive  to  be  annoyed.  The  young 
man  was  made  game  of  because  he  was  poor;  because 
he  was  bankrupt;  because  he  was  driven  to  the  shifts 
of  bankruptcy;  and  so  on.  But  he  did  not  seem  to 


76 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


know  he  was  something  much  worse  than  a  swindler, 
a  sorcerer.  He  did  not  know  he  was  by  his  own  boast 
a  mesmerist  and  a  mystagogue;  a  destroyer  of  reason 
and  will;  an  enemy  of  truth  and  liberty. 

I  think  such  people  exaggerate  the  extent  to  which 
it  pays  to  advertise;  even  if  there  is  only  the  devil  to 
pay.  But  in  one  sense  this  psychological  case  for  ad¬ 
vertising  is  of  great  practical  importance  to  any  pro¬ 
gramme  of  reform.  The  American  advertisers  have 
got  hold  of  the  wrong  end  of  the  stick;  but  it  is  a  stick 
that  can  be  used  to  beat  something  else  besides  their 
own  absurd  big  drum.  It  is  a  stick  that  can  be  used 
also  to  beat  their  own  absurd  business  philosophy. 
They  are  always  telling  us  that  the  success  of  modern 
commerce  depends  on  creating  an  atmosphere,  on 
manufacturing  a  mentality,  on  assuming  a  point  of 
view.  In  short,  they  insist  that  their  commerce  is  not 
merely  commercial,  or  even  economic  or  political, 
but  purely  psychological.  I  hope  they  will  go  on  say¬ 
ing  it;  for  then  some  day  everybody  may  suddenly 
see  that  it  is  true. 

For  the  success  of  big  shops  and  such  things  really 
is  psychology;  not  to  say  psycho-analysis;  or,  in  other 
words,  nightmare.  It  is  not  real  and,  therefore,  not 
reliable.  This  point  concerns  merely  our  immediate 
attitude,  at  the  moment  and  on  the  spot,  towards  the 
whole  plutocratic  occupation  of  which  such  publicity 
is  the  gaudy  banner.  The  very  first  thing  to  do,  before 
we  come  to  any  of  our  proposals  that  are  political  and 


THE  BLUFF  OF  THE  BIG  SHOPS  77 

legal,  is  something  that  really  is  (to  use  their  beloved 
word)  entirely  psychological.  The  very  first  thing  to 
do  is  to  tell  these  American  poker-players  that  they 
do  not  know  how  to  play  poker.  For  they  not  only 
bluff,  but  they  boast  that  they  are  bluffing.  In  so  far 
as  it  really  is  a  question  of  an  instant  psychological 
method,  there  must  be,  and  there  is,  an  immediate 
psychological  answer.  In  other  words,  because  they 
are  admittedly  bluffing,  we  can  call  their  bluff. 

I  said  recently  that  any  practical  programme  for 
restoring  normal  property  consists  of  two  parts,  which 
current  cant  would  call  destructive  and  constructive; 
but  which  might  more  truly  be  called  defensive  and 
offensive.  The  first  is  stopping  the  mere  mad  stam¬ 
pede  towards  monopoly,  before  the  last  traditions  of 
property  and  liberty  are  lost.  It  is  with  that  prelim¬ 
inary  problem  of  resisting  the  world’s  trend  towards 
being  more  monopolist,  that  I  am  first  of  all  dealing 
here.  Now,  when  we  ask  what  we  can  do,  here  and 
now,  against  the  actual  growth  of  monopoly,  we  are 
always  given  a  very  simple  answer.  We  are  told  that 
we  can  do  nothing.  By  a  natural  and  inevitable  op¬ 
eration  the  large  things  are  swallowing  the  small,  as 
large  fish  might  swallow  little  fish.  The  trust  can  ab¬ 
sorb  what  it  likes,  like  a  dragon  devouring  what  it 
likes,  because  it  is  already  the  largest  creature  left 
alive  in  the  land.  Some  people  are  so  finally  resolved 
to  accept  this  result  that  they  actually  condescend 
to  regret  it.  They  are  so  convinced  that  it  is  fate  that 


78  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

they  will  even  admit  that  it  is  fatality.  The  fatalists 
almost  become  sentimentalists  when  looking  at  the 
little  shop  that  is  being  bought  up  by  the  big  com¬ 
pany.  They  are  ready  to  weep,  so  long  as  it  is  ad¬ 
mitted  that  they  weep  because  they  weep  in  vain. 
They  are  willing  to  admit  that  the  loss  of  a  little  toy¬ 
shop  of  their  childhood,  or  a  little  tea-shop  of  their 
youth,  is  even  in  the  true  sense  a  tragedy.  For  a  trag¬ 
edy  means  always  a  man’s  struggle  with  that  which 
is  stronger  than  man.  And  it  is  the  feet  of  the  gods 
themselves  that  are  here  trampling  on  our  traditions; 
it  is  death  and  doom  themselves  that  have  broken  our 
little  toys  like  sticks;  for  against  the  stars  of  destiny 
none  shall  prevail.  It  is  amazing  what  a  little  bluff 
will  do  in  this  world. 

For  they  go  on  saying  that  the  big  fish  eats  the 
little  fish,  without  asking  whether  little  fish  swim  up 
to  big  fish  and  ask  to  be  eaten.  They  accept  the  de¬ 
vouring  dragon  without  wondering  whether  a  fash¬ 
ionable  crowd  of  princesses  ran  after  the  dragon  to 
be  devoured.  They  have  never  heard  of  a  fashion; 
and  do  not  know  the  difference  between  fashion  and 
fate.  The  necessitarians  have  here  carefully  chosen 
the  one  example  of  something  that  is  certainly  not 
necessary,  whatever  else  is  necessary.  They  have 
chosen  the  one  thing  that  does  happen  still  to  be 
free,  as  a  proof  of  the  unbreakable  chains  in  which 
all  things  are  bound.  Very  little  is  left  free  in  the 
modern  world;  but  private  buying  and  selling  are 


THE  BLUFF  OF  THE  BIG  SHOPS  79 

still  supposed  to  be  free;  and  indeed  still  are  free;  if 
anyone  has  a  will  free  enough  to  use  his  freedom. 
Children  may  be  driven  by  force  to  a  particular 
school.  Men  may  be  driven  by  force  away  from  a 
public-house.  All  sorts  of  people,  for  all  sorts  of  new 
and  nonsensical  reasons,  may  be  driven  by  force  to  a 
prison.  But  nobody  is  yet  driven  by  force  to  a  partic¬ 
ular  shop. 

I  shall  deal  later  with  some  practical  remedies  and 
reactions  against  the  rush  towards  rings  and  corners. 
But  even  before  we  consider  these,  it  is  well  to  have 
paused  a  moment  on  the  moral  fact  which  is  so  ele¬ 
mentary  and  so  entirely  ignored.  Of  all  things  in  the 
world,  the  rush  to  the  big  shops  is  the  thing  that  could 
be  most  easily  stopped — by  the  people  who  rush 
there.  We  do  not  know  what  may  come  later;  but 
they  cannot  be  driven  there  by  bayonets  just  yet. 
American  business  enterprise,  which  has  already  used 
British  soldiers  for  purposes  of  advertisement,  may 
doubtless  in  time  use  British  soldiers  for  purposes 
of  coercion.  But  we  cannot  yet  be  dragooned  by  guns 
and  sabres  into  Yankee  shops  or  international  stores. 
The  alleged  economic  attraction,  with  which  I  will 
deal  in  due  course,  is  quite  a  different  thing:  I  am 
merely  pointing  out  that  if  we  came  to  the  conclu¬ 
sion  that  big  shops  ought  to  be  boycotted,  we  could 
boycott  them  as  easily  as  we  should  (I  hope)  boy¬ 
cott  shops  selling  instruments  of  torture  or  poisons  for 
private  use  in  the  home.  In  other  words,  this  first  and 


s 


80  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

fundamental  question  is  not  a  question  of  necessity 
but  of  will.  If  we  chose  to  make  a  vow,  if  we  chose 
to  make  a  league,  for  dealing  only  with  little  local 
shops  and  never  with  large  centralized  shops,  the 
campaign  could  be  every  bit  as  practical  as  the  Land 
Campaign  in  Ireland.  It  would  probably  be  nearly  as 
successful.  It  will  be  said,  of  course,  that  people  will 
go  to  the  best  shop.  I  deny  it;  for.  Irish  boy  cotters  did 
not  take  the  best  offer.  I  deny  that  the  big  shop  is  the 
best  shop;  and  I  especially  deny  that  people  go  there 
because  it  is  the  best  shop.  And  if  I  be  asked  why,  I 
answer  at  the  end  with  the  unanswerable  fact  with 
which  I  began  at  the  beginning.  I  know  it  is  not 
merely  a  matter  of  business,  for  the  simple  reason 
that  the  business  men  themselves  tell  me  it  is 
merely  a  matter  of  bluff.  It  is  they  who  say  that  noth¬ 
ing  succeeds  like  a  mere  appearance  of  success.  It  is 
they  who  say  that  publicity  influences  us  without  our 
will  or  knowledge.  It  is  they  who  say  that  ‘'It  Pays  to 
Advertise”;  that  is,  to  tell  people  in  a  bullying  way 
that  they  must  “Do  It  Now,”  when  they  need  not  do 
it  at  all. 


II 


A  MISUNDERSTANDING  ABOUT  METHOD 

Before  I  go  any  further  with  this  sketch,  I  find 
I  must  pause  upon  a  parenthesis  touching  the  nature 
of  my  task,  without  which  the  rest  of  it  may  be  mis¬ 
understood.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  without  pretending 
to  any  official  or  commercial  experience,  I  am  here 
doing  a  great  deal  more  than  has  ever  been  asked 
of  most  of  the  mere  men  of  letters  (if  I  may  call  my¬ 
self  for  the  moment  a  man  of  letters)  when  they  con¬ 
fidently  conducted  social  movements  or  set  up  social 
ideals.  I  will  promise  that,  by  the  end  of  these  notes, 
the  reader  shall  know  a  great  deal  more  about  how 
men  might  set  about  making  a  Distributive  State 
than  the  readers  of  Carlyle  ever  knew  about  how  they 
should  set  about  finding  a  Hero  King  or  a  Real  Su¬ 
perior.  I  think  we  can  explain  how  to  make  a  small 
shop  or  a  small  farm  a  common  feature  of  our  so¬ 
ciety  better  than  Matthew  Arnold  explained  how  to 
make  the  State  the  organ  of  Our  Best  Self.  I  think  the 
farm  will  be  marked  on  some  sort  of  rude  map  more 
clearly  than  the  Earthly  Paradise  on  the  navigation 
chart  of  William  Morris;  and  I  think  that  in  compari¬ 
son  with  his  News  from  Nowhere  this  might  fairly 

be  called  News  from  Somewhere.  Rousseau  and  Rus-

kin  were  often  much  more  vague  and  visionary  than 
I  am;  though  Rousseau  was  even  more  rigid  in  ab¬ 
stractions,  and  Ruskin  was  sometimes  very  much  ex¬ 
cited  about  particular  details.  I  need  not  say  that  I 
am  not  comparing  myself  to  these  great  men;  I  am 
only  pointing  out  that  even  from  these,  whose  minds 
dominated  so  much  wider  a  field,  and  whose  position 
as  publicists  was  much  more  respected  and  responsi¬ 
ble,  nothing  was  as  a  matter  of  fact  asked  beyond  the 
general  principles  we  are  accused  of  giving.  I  am 
merely  pointing  out  that  the  task  has  fallen  to  a  very 
minor  poet  when  these  very  major  prophets  were  not 
required  to  carry  out  and  complete  the  fulfilment  of 
their  own  prophecies.  It  would  seem  that  our  fathers 
did  not  think  it  quite  so  futile  to  have  a  clear  vision 
of  the  goal  with  or  without  a  detailed  map  of  the 
road;  or  to  be  able  to  describe  a  scandal  without  go¬ 
ing  on  to  describe  a  substitute.  Anyhow,  for  whatever 
reason,  it  is  quite  certain  that  if  I  really  were  great 
enough  to  deserve  the  reproaches  of  the  utilitarians,  if 
I  really  were  as  merely  idealistic  or  imaginative ’as 
they  make  me  out,  if  I  really  did  confine  myself  to 
describing  a  direction  without  exactly  measuring  a 
road,  to  pointing  towards  home  or  heaven  and  telling 
men  to  use  their  own  good  sense  in  getting  there— 
if  this  were  really  all  that  I  could  do,  it  would  be  all 
that  men  immeasurably  greater  than  I  am  were  ever 

expected  to  do;  from  Plato  and  Isaiah  to  Emerson 
and  Tolstoy. 


A  MISUNDERSTANDING  83 

But  it  is  not  all  that  I  can  do;  even  though  those 
who  did  not  do  it  did  so  much  more.  I  can  do  some¬ 
thing  else  as  well;  but  I  can  only  do  it  if  it  be  under¬ 
stood  what  I  am  doing.  At  the  same  time  I  am  well 
aware  that,  in  explaining  the  improvement  of  so  elab¬ 
orate  a  society,  a  man  may  often  find  it  very  difficult 
to  explain  exactly  what  he  is  doing,  until  it  is  done. 
I  have  considered  and  rejected  half  a  dozen  ways  of 
approaching  the  problem,  by  different  roads  that  all 
lead  to  the  same  truth.  I  had  thought  of  beginning 
with  the  simple  example  of  the  peasant;  and  then  I 
knew  that  a  hundred  correspondents  would  leap  upon 
me,  accusing  me  of  trying  to  turn  all  of  them  into 
peasants.  I  thought  of  beginning  with  describing  a 
decent  Distributive  State  in  being,  with  all  its  bal¬ 
ance  of  different  things;  just  as  the  Socialists  describe 
their  Utopia  in  being,  with  its  concentration  in  one 
thing.  Then  I  knew  a  hundred  correspondents  would 
call  me  Utopian;  and  say  it  was  obvious  my  scheme 
could  not  work,  because  I  could  only  describe  it  when 
it  was  working.  But  what  they  would  really  mean  by 
my  being  Utopian,  would  be  this;  that  until  that 
scheme  was  working,  there  was  no  work  to  be  done.  I 
have  finally  decided  to  approach  the  social  solution  in 
this  fashion:  to  point  out  first  that  the  monopolist 
momentum  is  not  irresistible;  that  even  here  and  now 
much  could  be  done  to  modify  it,  much  by  anybody, 
almost  everything  by  everybody.  Then  I  would  main¬ 
tain  that  on  the  removal  of  that  particular  pluto- 


84  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

cratic  pressure,  the  appetite  and  appreciation  of  nat¬ 
ural  property  would  revive,  like  any  other  natural 
thing.  Then,  I  say,  it  will  be  worth  while  to  propound 
to  people  thus  returning  to  sanity,  however  sporadi¬ 
cally,  a  sane  society  that  could  balance  property  and 
control  machinery.  With  the  description  of  that  ulti¬ 
mate  society,  with  its  laws  and  limitations,  I  would 
conclude. 

Now  that  may  or  may  not  be  a  good  arrangement 
or  order  of  ideas;  but  it  is  an  intelligible  one;  and  I 
submit  with  all  humility  that  I  have  a  right  to  ar¬ 
range  my  explanations  in  that  order,  and  no  critic 
has  a  right  to  complain  that  I  do  not  disarrange  them 
in  order  to  answer  questions  out  of  their  order.  I  am 
willing  to  write  him  a  whole  Encyclopaedia  of  Dis¬ 
tributism  if  he  has  the  patience  to  read  it;  but  he 
must  have  the  patience  to  read  it.  It  is  unreasonable 
for  him  to  complain  that  I  have  not  dealt  adequately 
with  Zoology,  State  Provision  For,  under  the  letter 
B;  or  described  the  honourable  social  status  of  the 
Guild  of  the  Xylographers  while  I  am  still  dealing 
alphabetically  with  the  Guild  of  Architects.  I  am 
willing  to  be  as  much  of  a  bore  as  Euclid;  but  the 
critic  must  not  complain  that  the  forty-eighth  propo¬ 
sition  of  the  second  book  is  not  a  part  of  the  Pons 
Asinorum.  The  ancient  Guild  of  Bridge-Builders  will 
have  to  build  many  such  bridges. 

Now  from  comments  that  have  come  my  way,  I 
gather  that  the  suggestions  I  have  already  made  may 


A  MISUNDERSTANDING  85 

not  altogether  explain  their  own  place  and  purpose  in 
this  scheme.  I  am  merely  pointing  out  that  monopoly 
is  not  omnipotent  even  now  and  here;  and  that  any¬ 
body  could  think,  on  the  spur  of  the  moment,  of  many 
ways  in  which  its  final  triumph  can  be  delayed  and 
perhaps  defeated.  Suppose  a  monopolist  who  is  my 
mortal  enemy  endeavours  to  ruin  me  by  preventing 
me  from  selling  eggs  to  my  neighbours,  I  can  tell  him 
I  shall  live  on  my  own  turnips  in  my  own  kitchen- 
garden.  I  do  not  mean  to  tie  myself  to  turnips;  or 
swear  never  to  touch  my  own  potatoes  or  beans.  I 
mean  the  turnips  as  an  example;  something  to  throw 
at  him.  Suppose  the  wicked  millionaire  in  question 
comes  and  grins  over  my  garden  wall  and  says,  “I 
perceive  by  your  starved  and  emaciated  appearance 
that  you  are  in  immediate  need  of  a  few  shillings;  but 
you  can’t  possibly  get  them,”  I  may  possibly  be  stung 
into  retorting,  "Yes,  I  can.  I  could  sell  my  first  edi¬ 
tion  of  Martin  Cbu^lewit I  do  not  necessarily  mean 
that  I  see  myself  already  in  a  pauper’s  grave  unless  I 
can  sell  Martin  Chu^lewit;  I  do  not  mean  that  I 
have  nothing  else  to  suggest  except  selling  Martin 
Chutflewit;  I  do  not  mean  to  brag  like  any  com¬ 
mon  politician  that  I  have  nailed  my  colours  to  the 
Martin  Cbutflewit  policy.  I  mean  to  tell  the  offensive 
pessimist  that  I  am  not  at  the  end  of  my  resources; 
that  I  can  sell  a  book  or  even,  if  the  case  grows 
desperate,  write  a  book.  I  could  do  a  great  many 
things  before  I  came  to  definitely  anti-social  action 


86  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

like  robbing  a  bank  or  (worse  still)  working  in  a  bank. 
I  could  do  a  great  many  things  of  a  great  many  kinds, 
and  I  give  an  example  at  the  start  to  suggest  that 
there  are  many  more  of  them,  not  that  there  are  no 
more  of  them.  There  are  a  great  many  things  of  a 
great  many  kinds  in  my  house,  besides  the  copy  of  a 
Martin  Chu^lewit.  Not  many  of  them  are  of  great 
value  except  to  me;  but  some  of  them  are  of  some 
value  to  anybody.  For  the  whole  point  of  a  home 
is  that  it  is  a  hotch-potch.  And  mine,  at  any  rate, 
rises  to  that  austere  domestic  ideal.  The  whole  point 
of  one’s  own  house  is  that  it  is  not  only  a  number 
of  totally  different  things,  which  are  nevertheless 
one  thing,  but  it  is  one  in  which  we  still  value  even 
the  things  that  we  forget.  If  a  man  has  burnt  my 
house  to  a  heap  of  ashes,  I  am  none  the  less  justly 
indignant  with  him  for  having  burnt  everything, 
because  I  cannot  at  first  even  remember  everything 
he  has  burnt.  And  as  it  is  with  the  household  gods, 
so  it  is  with  the  whole  of  that  household  religion,  or 
what  remains  of  it,  to  offer  resistance  to  the  destruc¬ 
tive  discipline  of  industrial  capitalism.  In  a  simpler 
society,  I  should  rush  out  of  the  ruins,  calling  for 
help  on  the  Commune  or  the  King,  and  crying  out, 
“Haro!  a  robber  has  burnt  my  house.”  I  might,  of 
course,  rush  down  the  street  crying  in  one  passionate 
breath,  “Haro!  a  robber  has  burnt  my  front  door  of 
seasoned  oak  with  the  usual  fittings,  fourteen  window 
frames,  nine  curtains,  five  and  a  half  carpets,  753 


A  MISUNDERSTANDING  87 

books,  of  which  four  were  editions  de  luxe,  one  por¬ 
trait  of  my  great-grandmother,”  and  so  on  through  all 
the  items;  but  something  would  be  lost  of  the  fierce 
and  simple  feudal  cry.  And  in  the  same  way  I  could 
have  begun  this  outline  with  an  inventory  of  all  the 
alterations  I  should  like  to  see  in  the  laws,  with  the 
object  of  establishing  some  economic  justice  in  Eng¬ 
land.  But  I  doubt  whether  the  reader  would  have 
had  any  better  idea  of  what  I  was  ultimately  driving 
at;  and  it  would  not  have  been  the  approach  by  which 
I  propose  at  present  to  drive.  I  shall  have  occasion 
later  to  go  into  some  slight  detail  about  these  things; 
but  the  cases  I  give  are  merely  illustrations  of  my 
first  general  thesis:  that  we  are  not  even  at  the  mo¬ 
ment  doing  everything  that  could  be  done  to  resist 
the  rush  of  monopoly;  and  that  when  people  talk  as 
if  nothing  could  now  be  done,  that  statement  is  false 
at  the  start;  and  that  all  sorts  of  answers  to  it  will 
immediately  occur  to  the  mind. 

Capitalism  is  breaking  up;  and  in  one  sense  we 
do  not  pretend  to  be  sorry  it  is  breaking  up.  Indeed, 
we  might  put  our  own  point  pretty  correctly  by  say¬ 
ing  that  we  would  help  it  to  break  up;  but  we  do 
not  want  it  merely  to  break  down.  But  the  first  fact 
to  realize  is  precisely  that;  that  it  is  a  choice  between 
its  breaking  up  and  its  breaking  down.  It  is  a  choice 
between  its  being  voluntarily  resolved  into  its  real 
component  parts,  each  taking  back  its  own,  and  its 
merely  collapsing  on  our  heads  in  a  crash  or  confusion 


88  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

of  all  its  component  parts,  which  some  call  com¬ 
munism  and  some  call  chaos.  The  former  is  the  one 
thing  all  sensible  people  should  try  to  procure.  The 
latter  is  the  one  thing  that  all  sensible  people  should 
try  to  prevent.  That  is  why  they  are  often  classed 
together. 

I  have  mainly  confined  myself  to  answering  what 
I  have  always  found  to  be  the  first  question,  “What 
are  we  to  do  now?”  To  that  I  answer,  “What  we  must 
do  now  is  to  stop  the  other  people  from  doing  what 
they  are  doing  now.”  The  initiative  is  with  the  enemy. 
It  is  he  who  is  already  doing  things,  and  will  have 
done  them  long  before  we  can  begin  to  do  anything, 
since  he  has  the  money,  the  machinery,  the  rather 
mechanical  majority,  and  other  things  which  we  have 
first  to  gain  and  then  to  use.  He  has  nearly  completed 
a  monopolist  conquest,  but  not  quite;  and  he  can 
still  be  hampered  and  halted.  The  world  has  woken 
up  very  late;  but  that  is  not  our  fault.  That  is  the 
fault  of  all  the  fools  who  told  us  for  twenty  years 
that  there  could  never  be  any  Trusts;  and  are  now 
telling  us,  equally  wisely,  that  there  can  never  be 
anything  else. 

There  are  other  things  I  ask  the  reader  to  bear  in 
mind.  The  first  is  that  this  outline  is  only  an  outline, 
though  one  that  can  hardly  avoid  some  curves  and 
loops.  I  do  not  profess  to  dispose  of  all  the  obstacles 
that  might  arise  in  this  question,  because  so  many  of 
them  would  seem  to  many  to  be  quite  a  different 


A  MISUNDERSTANDING  89 

question.  I  will  give  one  example  of  what  I  mean. 
What  would  the  critical  reader  have  thought,  if  at  the 
very  beginning  of  this  sketch  I  had  gone  off  into  a 
long  disputation  about  the  Law  of  Libel?  Yet,  if  I 
were  strictly  practical,  I  should  find  that  one  of  the 
most  practical  obstacles.  It  is  the  present  ridiculous 
position  that  monopoly  is  not  resisted  as  a  social 
force  but  can  still  be  resented  as  a  legal  imputation. 
If  you  try  to  stop  a  man  cornering  milk,  the  first 
thing  that  happens  will  be  a  smashing  libel  action  for 
calling  it  a  corner.  It  is  manifestly  mere  common 
sense  that  if  the  thing  is  not  a  sin  it  is  not  a  slander. 
As  things  stand,  there  is  no  punishment  for  the  man 
who  does  it;  but  there  is  a  punishment  for  the  man 
who  discovers  it.  I  do  not  deal  here  (though  I  am 
quite  prepared  to  deal  elsewhere)  with  all  these  de¬ 
tailed  difficulties  which  a  society  as  now  constituted 
would  raise  against  such  a  society  as  we  want  to  con¬ 
stitute.  If  it  were  constituted  on  the  principles  I 
suggest,  those  details  would  be  dealt  with  on  those 
principles  as  they  arose.  For  instance,  it  would  put 
an  end  to  the  nonsense  whereby  men,  who  are  more 
powerful  than  emperors,  pretend  to  be  private  trades¬ 
men  suffering  from  private  malice;  it  will  assert  that 
those  who  are  in  practice  public  men  must  be  criti¬ 
cized  as  potential  public  evils.  It  would  destroy  the 
absurdity  by  which  an  “important  case”  is  tried 
by  a  “special  jury”;  or,  in  other  words,  that  any 
serious  issue  between  rich  and  poor  is  tried  by  the 


90  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

rich.  But  the  reader  will  see  that  I  cannot  here  rule 
out  all  the  ten  thousand  things  that  might  trip  us 
up;  I  must  assume  that  a  people  ready  to  take  the 
larger  risks  would  also  take  the  smaller  ones. 

Now  this  outline  is  an  outline;  in  other  words,  it 
is  a  design,  and  anybody  who  thinks  we  can  have 
practical  things  without  theoretical  designs  can  go 
and  quarrel  with  the  nearest  engineer  or  architect 
for  drawing  thin  lines  on  thin  paper.  But  there  is 
another  and  more  special  sense  in  which  my  sug¬ 
gestion  is  an  outline;  in  the  sense  that  it  is  deliber¬ 
ately  drawn  as  a  large  limitation  within  which  there 
are  many  varieties.  I  have  long  been  acquainted, 
and  not  a  little  amused,  with  the  sort  of  practical 
man  who  will  certainly  say  that  I  generalize  because 
there  is  no  practical  plan.  The  truth  is  that  I  gen¬ 
eralize  because  there  are  so  many  practical  plans. 
I  myself  know  four  or  five  schemes  that  have  been 
drawn  up,  more  or  less  drastically,  for  the  diffusion 
of  capital.  The  most  cautious,  from  a  capitalist  stand¬ 
point,  is  the  gradual  extension  of  profit-sharing.  A 
more  stringently  democratic  form  of  the  same  thing 
is  the  management  of  every  business  (if  it  cannot 
be  a  small  business)  by  a  guild  or  group  clubbing 
their  contributions  and  dividing  their  results.  Some 
Distributists  dislike  the  idea  of  the  workman  having 
shares  only  where  he  has  work;  they  think  he  would 
be  more  independent  if  his  little  capital  were  in¬ 
vested  elsewhere;  but  they  all  agree  that  he  ought 


A  MISUNDERSTANDING  91 

to  have  the  capital  to  invest.  Others  continue  to  call 
themselves  Distributists  because  they  would  give 
every  citizen  a  dividend  out  of  much  larger  national 
systems  of  production.  I  deliberately  draw  out  my 
general  principles  so  as  to  cover  as  many  as  possible 
of  these  alternative  business  schemes.  But  I  object 
to  being  told  that  I  am  covering  so  many  because  I 
know  there  are  none.  If  I  tell  a  man  he  is  too  luxurious 
and  extravagant,  and  that  he  ought  to  economize  in 
something,  I  am  not  bound  to  give  him  a  list  of  his 
luxuries.  The  point  is  that  he  will  be  all  the  better 
for  cutting  down  any  of  his  luxuries.  And  my  point 
is  that  modern  society  would  be  all  the  better  for 
cutting  up  property  by  any  of  these  processes.  This 
does  not  mean  that  I  have  not  my  own  favourite 
form ;  personally  I  prefer  the  second  type  of  division 
given  in  the  above  list  of  examples.  But  my  main 
business  is  to  point  out  that  any  reversal  of  the  rush 
to  concentrate  property  will  be  an  improvement  on 
the  present  state  of  things.  If  I  tell  a  man  his  house 
is  burning  down  in  Putney,  he  may  thank  me  even 
if  I  do  not  give  him  a  list  of  all  the  vehicles  which 
go  to  Putney,  with  the  numbers  of  all  the  taxicabs 
and  the  time-table  of  all  the  trams.  It  is  enough  that 
I  know  there  are  a  great  many  vehicles  for  him  to 
choose  from,  before  he  is  reduced  to  the  proverbial 
adventure  of  going  to  Putney  on  a  pig.  It  is  enough 
that  any  one  of  those  vehicles  is  on  the  whole  less 
uncomfortable  than  a  house  on  fire  or  even  a  heap 


92 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


of  ashes.  I  admit  I  might  be  called  unpractical  if 
impenetrable  forests  and  destructive  floods  lay  be¬ 
tween  here  and  Putney;  it  might  then  be  as  merely 
idealistic  to  praise  Putney  as  to  praise  Paradise. 
But  I  do  not  admit  that  I  am  unpractical  because  I 
know  there  are  half  a  dozen  practical  ways  which  are 
more  practical  than  the  present  state  of  things.  But 
it  does  not  follow,  in  fact,  that  I  do  not  know  how  to 
get  to  Putney.  Here,  for  instance,  are  half  a  dozen 
things  which  would  help  the  process  of  Distributism, 
apart  from  those  on  which  I  shall  have  occasion  to 
touch  as  points  of  principle.  Not  all  Distributists 
would  agree  with  all  of  them;  but  all  would  agree 
that  they  are  in  the  direction  of  Distributism.  (1) 
The  taxation  of  contracts  so  as  to  discourage  the  sale 
of  small  property  to  big  proprietors  and  encourage 
the  break-up  of  big  property  among  small  proprietors. 
(2)  Something  like  the  Napoleonic  testamentary  law 
and  the  destruction  of  primogeniture.  (3)  The  estab¬ 
lishment  of  free  law  for  the  poor,  so  that  small  prop¬ 
erty  could  always  be  defended  against  great.  (4)  The 
deliberate  protection  of  certain  experiments  in  small 
property,  if  necessary  by  tariffs  and  even  local  tariffs. 
(5)  Subsidies  to  foster  the  starting  of  such  experi¬ 
ments.  (6)  A  league  of  voluntary  dedication,  and 
any  number  of  other  things  of  the  same  kind.  But  I 
have  inserted  this  chapter  here  in  order  to  explain 
that  this  is  a  sketch  of  the  first  principles  of  Dis¬ 
tributism  and  not  of  the  last  details,  about  which  even 


A  MISUNDERSTANDING  93 

Distributists  might  dispute.  In  such  a  statement,  ex¬ 
amples  are  given  as  examples,  and  not  as  exact  and 
exhaustive  lists  of  all  the  cases  covered  by  the  rule. 
If  this  elementary  principle  of  exposition  be  not 
understood  I  must  be  content  to  be  called  an  un¬ 
practical  person  by  that  sort  of  practical  man.  And 
indeed  in  his  sense  there  is  something  in  his  accusa¬ 
tion.  Whether  or  no  I  am  a  practical  man,  I  am  not 
what  is  called  a  practical  politician,  which  means  a 
professional  politician.  I  can  claim  no  part  in  the 
glory  of  having  brought  our  country  to  its  present 
promising  and  hopeful  condition.  Harder  heads  than 
mine  have  established  the  present  prosperity  of  coal. 
Men  of  action,  of  a  more  rugged  energy,  have  brought 
us  to  the  comfortable  condition  of  living  on  our  cap¬ 
ital.  I  have  had  no  part  in  the  great  industrial  revolu¬ 
tion  which  has  increased  the  beauties  of  nature  and 
reconciled  the  classes  of  society;  nor  must  the  too  en¬ 
thusiastic  reader  think  of  thanking  me  for  this  more 
enlightened  England,  in  which  the  employee  is  living 
on  a  dole  from  the  State  and  the  employer  on  an 
overdraft  at  the  Bank.

A  CASE  IN  POINT 

It  is  as  natural  to  our  commercial  critics  to  argue 
in  a  circle  as  to  travel  on  the  Inner  Circle.  It  is  not 
mere  stupidity,  but  it  is  mere  habit;  and  it  is  not 
easy  either  to  break  into  or  to  escape  from  that  iron 
ring.  When  we  say  things  can  be  done,  we  commonly 
mean  either  that  they  could  be  done  by  the  mass  of 
men,  or  else  by  the  ruler  of  the  State.  I  gave  an  ex¬ 
ample  of  something  that  could  be  done  quite  easily 
by  the  mass;  and  here  I  will  give  an  example  of  some¬ 
thing  that  could  be  done  quite  easily  by  the  ruler. 
But  we  must  be  prepared  for  our  critics  beginning  to 
argue  in  a  circle  and  saying  that  the  present  populace 
will  never  agree  or  the  present  ruler  act  in  that  way. 
But  this  complaint  is  a  confusion.  We  are  answering 
people  who  call  our  ideal  impossible  in  itself.  If  you 
do  not  want  it,  of  course,  you  will  not  try  to  get  it; 
but  do  not  say  that  because  you  do  not  want  it,  it 
follows  that  you  could  not  get  it  if  you  did  want  it. 
A  thing  does  not  become  intrinsically  impossible 
merely  by  a  mob  not  trying  to  obtain  it;  nor  does  a 
thing  cease  to  be  practical  politics  because  no  politi¬ 
cian  is  practical  enough  to  do  it. 

I  will  start  with  a  small  and  familiar  example.  In 

94 


A  CASE  IN  POINT  95 

order  to  ensure  that  our  huge  proletariat  should  have 
a  holiday,  we  have  a  law  obliging  all  employers  to 
shut  their  shops  for  half  a  day  once  a  week.  Given 
the  proletarian  principle,  it  is  a  healthy  and  neces¬ 
sary  thing  for  a  proletarian  state;  just  as  the  satur¬ 
nalia  is  a  healthy  and  necessary  thing  for  a  slave  state. 
Given  this  provision  for  the  proletariat,  a  practical 
person  will  naturally  say:  “It  has  other  advantages, 
too;  it  will  be  a  chance  for  anybody  who  chooses  to 
do  his  own  dirty  work;  for  the  man  who  can  man¬ 
age  without  servants.”  That  degraded  being  who  ac¬ 
tually  knows  how  to  do  things  himself,  will  have  a 
look  in  at  last.  That  isolated  crank,  who  can  really 
work  for  his  own  living,  may  possibly  have  a  chance 
to  live.  A  man  does  not  need  to  be  a  Distributist  to 
say  this;  it  is  the  ordinary  and  obvious  thing  that 
anybody  would  say.  The  man  who  has  servants  must 
cease  to  work  his  servants.  Of  course,  the  man  who 
has  no  servants  to  work  cannot  cease  to  work  them. 
But  the  law  is  actually  so  constructed  that  it  forces 
this  man  also  to  give  a  holiday  to  the  servants  he 
has  not  got.  He  proclaims  a  saturnalia  that  never 
happens  to  a  crowd  of  phantom  slaves  that  have 
never  been  there.  Now  there  is  not  a  rudiment  of 
reason  about  this  arrangement.  In  every  possible 
sense,  from  the  immediate  material  to  the  abstract 
and  mathematical  sense,  it  is  quite  mad.  We  live  in 
days  of  dangerous  division  of  interests  between  the 
employer  and  the  employed.  Therefore,  even  when 


96 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


the  two  are  not  divided,  but  actually  united  in  one 
person,  we  must  divide  them  again  into  two  parties. 
We  coerce  a  man  into  giving  himself  something  he 
does  not  want,  because  somebody  else  who  does  not 
exist  might  want  it.  We  warn  him  that  he  had  better 
receive  a  deputation  from  himself,  or  he  might  go 
on  strike  against  himself.  Perhaps  he  might  even  be¬ 
come  a  Bolshevist,  and  throw  a  bomb  at  himself;  in 
which  case  he  would  have  no  other  course  left  to  his 
stern  sense  of  law  and  order  but  to  read  the  Riot 
Act  and  shoot  himself.  They  call  us  unpractical;  but 
we  have  not  yet  produced  such  an  academic  fantasy 
as  this.  They  sometimes  suggest  that  our  regret  for 
the  disappearance  of  the  yeoman  or  the  apprentice 
is  a  mere  matter  of  sentiment.  Sentimental!  We  have 
not  quite  sunk  to  such  sentimentalism  as  to  be  sorry 
for  apprentices  who  never  existed  at  all.  We  have 
not  quite  reached  that  richness  of  romantic  emotion 
that  we  are  capable  of  weeping  more  copiously  for 
an  imaginary  grocer’s  assistant  than  for  a  real  gro¬ 
cer.  We  are  not  quite  so  maudlin  yet  as  to  see  double 
when  we  look  into  our  favourite  little  shop;  or  to  set 
the  little  shopkeeper  fighting  with  his  own  shadow. 
Let  us  leave  these  hard-headed  and  practical  men 
of  business  shedding  tears  over  the  sorrows  of  a  non¬ 
existent  office  boy,  and  proceed  upon  our  own  wild 
and  erratic  path,  that  at  least  happens  to  pass  across 
the  land  of  the  living. 

Now  if  so  small  a  change  as  that  were  made  to- 


97 


A  CASE  IN  POINT 

morrow,  it  would  make  a  difference:  a  considerable 
and  increasing  difference.  And  if  any  rash  apologist 
of  Big  Business  tells  me  that  a  little  thing  like  that 
could  make  very  little  difference,  let  him  beware. 
For  he  is  doing  the  one  thing  which  such  apologists 
commonly  avoid  above  all  things:  he  is  contradict¬ 
ing  his  masters.  Among  the  thousand  things  of  in¬ 
terest,  which  are  lost  in  the  million  things  of  no  in¬ 
terest,  in  the  newspaper  reports  of  Parliament  and 
public  affairs,  there  really  was  one  delightful  little 
comedy  dealing  with  this  point.  Some  man  of  nor¬ 
mal  sense  and  popular  instincts,  who  had  strayed  into 
Parliament  by  some  mistake  or  other,  actually 
pointed  out  this  plain  fact:  that  there  was  no  need 
to  protect  the  proletariat  where  there  was  no  pro¬ 
letariat  to  protect;  and  that  the  lonely  shopkeeper 
might,  therefore,  remain  in  his  lonely  shop.  And  the 
Minister  in  charge  of  the  matter  actually  replied, 
with  a  ghastly  innocence,  that  it  was  impossible;  for 
it  would  be  unfair  to  the  big  shops.  Tears  evidently 
flow  freely  in  such  circles,  as  they  did  from  the  rising 
politician,  Lord  Lundy;  and  in  this  case  it  was  the 
mere  thought  of  the  possible  sufferings  of  the  million¬ 
aires  that  moved  him.  There  rose  before  his  imagina¬ 
tion  Mr.  Self  ridge  in  his  agony,  and  the  groans  of 
Mr.  Woolworth,  of  the  Woolworth  Tower,  thrilled 
through  the  kind  hearts  to  which  the  cry  of  the  sor¬ 
rowing  rich  will  never  come  in  vain.  But  whatever  we 
may  think  of  the  sensibility  needed  to  regard  the  big 


98 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


store-owners  as  objects  of  sympathy,  at  any  rate  it 
disposes  at  a  stroke  of  all  the  fashionable  fatalism 
that  sees  something  inevitable  in  their  success.  It  is 
absurd  to  tell  us  that  our  attack  is  bound  to  fail;  and 
then  that  there  would  be  something  quite  unscrupu¬ 
lous  in  its  so  immediately  succeeding.  Apparently  Big 
Business  must  be  accepted  because  it  is  invulnerable, 
and  spared  because  it  is  vulnerable.  This  big  absurd 
bubble  can  never  conceivably  be  burst;  and  it  is 
simply  cruel  that  a  little  pin-prick  of  competition 
can  burst  it. 

I  do  not  know  whether  the  big  shops  are  quite  so 
weak  and  wobbly  as  their  champion  said.  But  what¬ 
ever  the  immediate  effect  on  the  big  shops,  I  am  sure 
there  would  be  an  immediate  effect  on  the  little  shops. 
I  am  sure  that  if  they  could  trade  on  the  general 
holiday,  it  would  not  only  mean  that  there  would  be 
more  trade  for  them,  but  that  there  would  be  more 
of  them  trading.  It  might  mean  at  last  a  large  class 
of  little  shopkeepers;  and  that  is  exactly  the  sort  of 
thing  that  makes  all  the  political  difference,  as  it  does 
in  the  case  of  a  large  class  of  little  farmers.  It  is  not 
in  the  merely  mechanical  sense  a  matter  of  numbers. 
It  is  a  matter  of  the  presence  and  pressure  of  a  par¬ 
ticular  social  type.  It  is  not  a  question  merely  of  how 
many  noses  are  counted;  but  in  the  more  real  sense 
whether  the  noses  count.  If  there  were  anything  that 
could  be  called  a  class  of  peasants,  or  a  class  of  small 
shopkeepers,  they  would  make  their  presence  felt  in 


99 


A  CASE  IN  POINT 

legislation,  even  if  it  were  what  is  called  class  legis¬ 
lation.  And  the  very  existence  of  that  third  class 
would  be  the  end  of  what  is  called  the  class  war; 
in  so  far  as  its  theory  divides  all  men  into  employers 
and  employed.  I  do  not  mean,  of  course,  that  this 
little  legal  alteration  is  the  only  one  I  have  to  pro¬ 
pose;  I  mention  it  first  because  it  is  the  most  obvious. 
But  I  mention  it  also  because  it  illustrates  very  clearly 
what  I  mean  by  the  two  stages:  the  nature  of  the 
negative  and  positive  reform.  If  little  shops  began 
to  gain  custom  and  big  shops  began  to  lose  it,  it 
would  mean  two  things,  both  indeed  preliminary  but 
both  practical.  It  would  mean  that  the  mere  centrip¬ 
etal  rush  was  slowed  down,  if  not  stopped,  and 
might  at  last  change  to  a  centrifugal  movement.  And 
it  would  mean  that  there  were  a  number  of  new 
citizens  in  the  State  to  whom  all  the  ordinary  Social¬ 
ist  or  servile  arguments  were  inapplicable.  Now  when 
you  have  got  your  considerable  sprinkling  of  small 
proprietors,  of  men  with  the  psychology  and  philos¬ 
ophy  of  small  property,  then  you  can  begin  to  talk 
to  them  about  something  more  like  a  just  general 
settlement  upon  their  own  lines;  something  more  like 
a  land  fit  for  Christians  to  live  in.  You  can  make 
them  understand,  as  you  cannot  make  plutocrats  or 
proletarians  understand,  why  the  machine  must  not 
exist  save  as  the  servant  of  the  man,  why  the  things 
we  produce  ourselves  are  precious  like  our  own  chil¬ 
dren,  and  why  we  can  pay  too  dearly  for  the  posses- 


100  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

sion  of  luxury  by  the  loss  of  liberty.  If  bodies  of  men 
only  begin  to  be  detached  from  the  servile  settle¬ 
ments,  they  will  begin  to  form  the  body  of  our  public 
opinion.  Now  there  are  a  large  number  of  other  ad¬ 
vantages  that  could  be  given  to  the  small  man,  which 
can  be  considered  in  their  place.  In  all  of  them  I 
presuppose  a  deliberate  policy  of  favouring  the  small 
man.  But  in  the  primary  example  here  given  we  can 
hardly  even  say  that  there  is  any  question  of  favour. 
You  make  a  law  that  slave-owners  shall  free  their 
slaves  for  a  day:  the  man  who  has  no  slaves  is  out¬ 
side  the  thing  entirely;  he  does  not  come  under  it  in 
law,  because  he  does  not  come  into  it  in  logic.  He 
has  been  deliberately  dragged  into  it;  not  in  order 
that  all  slaves  shall  be  free  for  a  day,  but  in  order 
that  all  free  men  shall  be  slaves  for  a  lifetime.  But 
while  some  of  the  expedients  are  only  common  jus¬ 
tice  to  small  property,  and  others  are  deliberate  pro¬ 
tection  of  small  property,  the  point  at  the  moment 
is  that  it  will  be  worth  while  at  the  beginning  to 
create  small  property  though  it  were  only  on  a  small 
scale.  English  citizens  and  yeomen  would  once  more 
exist;  and  wherever  they  exist  they  count.  There  are 
many  other  ways,  which  can  be  briefly  described,  by 
which  the  break-up  of  property  can  be  encouraged 
on  the  legal  and  legislative  side.  I  shall  deal  with 
some  of  them  later,  and  especially  with  the  real  re¬ 
sponsibility  which  Government  might  reasonably  as¬ 
sume  in  a  financial  and  economic  condition  which  is 


101 


A  CASE  IN  POINT 

becoming  quite  ludicrous.  From  the  standpoint  of 
any  sane  person,  in  any  other  society,  the  present 
problem  of  capitalist  concentration  is  not  only  a  ques¬ 
tion  of  law  but  of  criminal  law,  not  to  mention  crim¬ 
inal  lunacy. 

Of  that  monstrous  megalomania  of  the  big  shops, 
with  their  blatant  advertisements  and  stupid  stand¬ 
ardization,  something  is  said  elsewhere.  But  it  may  be 
well  to  add,  in  the  matter  of  the  small  shops,  that 
when  once  they  exist  they  generally  have  an  organ¬ 
ization  of  their  own  which  is  much  more  self- 
respecting  and  much  less  vulgar.  This  voluntary  or¬ 
ganization,  as  every  one  knows,  is  called  a  Guild; 
and  it  is  perfectly  capable  of  doing  everything  that 
really  needs  to  be  done  in  the  way  of  holidays  and 
popular  festivals.  Twenty  barbers  would  be  quite  ca¬ 
pable  of  arranging  with  each  other  not  to  compete 
with  each  other  on  a  particular  festival  or  in  a  particu¬ 
lar  fashion.  It  is  amusing  to  note  that  the  same  people 
who  say  that  a  Guild  is  a  dead  medieval  thing  that 
would  never  work  are  generally  grumbling  against 
the  power  of  a  Guild  as  a  living  modern  thing  where 
it  is  actually  working.  In  the  case  of  the  Guild  of  the 
Doctors,  for  instance,  it  is  made  a  matter  of  reproach 
in  the  newspapers,  that  the  confederation  in  question 
refuses  to  “make  medical  discoveries  accessible  to  the 
general  public.”  When  we  consider  the  wild  and  un¬ 
balanced  nonsense  that  is  made  accessible  to  the  gen¬ 
eral  public  by  the  public  press,  perhaps  we  have  some 


102 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


reason  to  doubt  whether  our  souls  and  bodies  are 
not  at  least  as  safe  in  the  hands  of  a  Guild  as  they 
are  likely  to  be  in  the  hands  of  a  Trust.  For  the  mo¬ 
ment  the  main  point  is  that  small  shops  can  be 
governed  even  if  they  are  not  bossed  by  the  Govern¬ 
ment.  Horrible  as  this  may  seem  to  the  democratic 
idealists  of  the  day,  they  can  be  governed  by  them¬ 
selves. 


IV 

THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS 

We  have  most  of  us  met  in  literature,  and  even 
in  life,  a  certain  sort  of  old  gentleman;  he  is  very 
often  represented  by  an  old  clergyman.  He  is  the 
sort  of  man  who  has  a  horror  of  Socialists  without 
any  very  definite  idea  of  what  they  are.  He  is  the 
man  of  whom  men  say  that  he  means  well;  by  which 
they  mean  that  he  means  nothing.  But  this  view  is  a 
little  unjust  to  this  social  type.  He  is  really  some¬ 
thing  more  than  well-meaning;  we  might  even  go  so 
far  as  to  say  that  he  would  probably  be  right-thinking, 
if  he  ever  thought.  His  principles  would  probably  be 
sound  enough  if  they  were  really  applied;  it  is  his 
practical  ignorance  that  prevents  him  from  knowing 
the  world  to  which  they  are  applicable.  He  might 
really  be  right,  only  he  has  no  notion  of  what  is 
wrong.  Those  who  have  sat  under  this  old  gentle¬ 
man  know  that  he  is  in  the  habit  of  softening  his 
stern  repudiation  of  the  mysterious  Socialists  by  say¬ 
ing  that,  of  course,  it  is  a  Christian  duty  to  use  our 
wealth  well,  to  remember  that  property  is  a  trust  com¬ 
mitted  to  us  by  Providence  for  the  good  of  others  as 
well  as  ourselves,  and  even  (unless  the  old  gentle¬ 
man  is  old  enough  to  be  a  Modernist)  that  it  is  just 

103 


104  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

possible  that  we  may  some  day  be  asked  a  question 
or  two  about  the  abuse  of  such  a  trust.  Now  all  this 
is  perfectly  true,  so  far  as  it  goes,  but  it  happens  to 
illustrate  in  a  rather  curious  way  the  queer  and  even 
uncanny  innocence  of  the  old  gentleman.  The  very 
phrase  that  he  uses,  when  he  says  that  property  is 
a  trust  committed  to  us  by  Providence,  is  a  phrase 
which  takes  on,  when  it  is  uttered  to  the  world 
around  him,  the  character  of  an  awful  and  appalling 
pun.  His  pathetic  little  sentence  returns  in  a  hundred 
howling  echoes,  repeating  it  again  and  again  like  the 
laughter  of  a  hundred  fiends  in  hell:  “Property  is  a 
Trust.” 

Now  I  could  not  more  conveniently  sum  up  what 
I  meant  by  this  first  section  than  by  taking  this 
type  of  the  dear  old  conservative  clergyman,  and 
considering  the  curious  way  in  which  he  has  been 
first  caught  napping,  and  then  as  it  were  knocked 
on  the  head.  The  first  thing  we  have  had  to  explain 
to  him  is  expressed  in  that  horrible  pun  about  the 
Trust.  While  he  has  been  crying  out  against  im¬ 
aginary  robbers,  whom  he  calls  Socialists,  he  has  been 
caught  and  carried  away  bodily  by  real  robbers, 
whom  he  still  could  not  even  imagine.  For  the  gangs 
of  gamblers  who  make  the  great  combines  are  really 
gangs  of  robbers,  in  the  sense  that  they  have  far  less 
feeling  than  anybody  else  for  that  individual  re¬ 
sponsibility  for  individual  gifts  of  God  which  the  old 
gentleman  very  rightly  calls  a  Christian  duty.  While 


THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS  105 

he  has  been  weaving  words  in  the  air  about  irrelevant 
ideals,  he  has  been  caught  in  a  net  woven  out  of  the 
very  opposite  words  and  notions:  impersonal,  irre¬ 
sponsible,  irreligious.  The  financial  forces  that  sur¬ 
round  him  are  further  away  than  anything  else  from 
the  domestic  idea  of  ownership  with  which,  to  do 
him  justice,  he  himself  began.  So  that  when  he  still 
bleats  faintly,  “Property  is  a  trust,”  we  shall  reply 
firmly,  “A  trust  is  not  property.” 

And  now  I  come  to  the  really  extraordinary  thing 
about  the  old  gentleman.  I  mean  that  I  come  to  the 
queerest  fact  about  the  conventional  or  conservative 
type  in  modern  English  society.  And  that  is  the  fact 
that  the  same  society,  which  began  by  saying  there 
was  no  such  danger  to  avoid,  now  says  that  the  danger 
cannot  possibly  be  avoided.  Our  whole  capitalist 
community  has  taken  one  huge  stride  from  the  ex¬ 
treme  of  optimism  to  the  extreme  of  pessimism.  They 
began  by  saying  that  there  could  not  be  Trusts  in 
this  country.  They  have  ended  by  saying  that  there 
cannot  be  anything  else  except  Trusts  in  this  age. 
And  in  the  course  of  calling  the  same  thing  impossible 
on  Monday  and  inevitable  on  Tuesday,  they  have 
saved  the  life  of  the  great  gambler  or  robber  twice 
over;  first  by  calling  him  a  fabulous  monster,  and 
second  by  calling  him  an  almighty  fate.  Twelve  years 
ago,  when  I  talked  of  Trusts,  people  said:  “There 
are  no  Trusts  in  England.”  Now,  when  I  say  it,  the 
same  people  say:  “But  how  do  you  propose  that  Eng- 


106  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

land  should  escape  from  the  Trusts?”  They  talk  as  if 
the  Trusts  had  always  been  a  part  of  the  British 
Constitution,  not  to  mention  the  Solar  System.  In 
short,  the  pun  and  parable  with  which  I  began  this 
article  have  exactly  and  ironically  come  true.  The 
poor  old  clergyman  is  now  really  driven  to  talk  as  if 
a  Trust  with  a  big  T  were  something  that  had  been 
bestowed  on  him  by  Providence.  He  is  driven  to 
abandon  all  that  he  originally  meant  by  his  own 
curious  sort  of  Christian  individualism,  and  hastily 
reconcile  himself  to  something  that  is  more  like  a 
sort  of  plutocratic  collectivism.  He  is  beginning,  in 
a  rather  bewildered  way,  to  understand  that  he  must 
now  say  that  monopoly  and  not  merely  private  prop¬ 
erty  is  a  part  of  the  nature  of  things.  The  net  had 
been  thrown  over  him  while  he  slept,  because  he 
never  thought  of  such  a  thing  as  a  net;  because  he 
would  have  denied  the  very  possibility  of  anybody 
weaving  such  a  net.  But  now  the  poor  old  gentle¬ 
man  has  to  begin  to  talk  as  if  he  had  been  born  in 
the  net.  Perhaps,  as  I  say,  he  has  had  a  knock  on 
the  head,  perhaps,  as  his  enemies  say,  he  was  always 
just  a  little  weak  in  the  head.  But,  anyhow,  now  that 
his  head  is  in  the  noose,  or  the  net,  he  will  often  start 
preaching  to  us  about  the  impossibility  of  escaping 
from  nets  and  nooses  that  are  woven  or  spun  upon 
the  wheel  of  the  fates.  In  a  word,  I  wish  to  point  out 
that  the  old  gentleman  was  much  too  heedless  about 


THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS  107 

getting  into  the  net  and  is  much  too  hopeless  about 
getting  out  of  it. 

In  short,  I  would  sum  up  my  general  suggestions 
so  far  by  saying  that  the  chief  danger  to  be  avoided 
now,  and  the  first  danger  to  be  considered  now,  is 
the  danger  of  supposing  the  capitalist  conquest  more 
complete  than  it  is.  If  I  may  use  the  terms  of  the 
Penny  Catechism  about  the  two  sins  against  hope, 
the  peril  now  is  no  longer  the  peril  of  presumption 
but  rather  of  despair.  It  is  not  mere  impudence  like 
that  of  those  who  told  us,  without  winking  an  eye¬ 
lid,  that  there  were  no  Trusts  in  England.  It  is  rather 
mere  impotence  like  that  of  those  who  tell  us  that 
England  must  soon  be  swallowed  up  in  an  earthquake 
called  America.  Now  this  sort  of  surrender  to  modern 
monopoly  is  not  only  ignoble,  it  is  also  panic-stricken 
and  premature.  It  is  not  true  that  we  can  do  nothing. 
What  I  have  written  so  far  has  been  directed  to  show¬ 
ing  the  doubtful  and  the  terrified  that  it  is  not  true 
that  we  can  do  nothing.  Even  now  there  is  something 
that  can  be  done,  and  done  at  once;  though  the  things 
so  to  be  done  may  appear  to  be  of  different  kinds  and 
even  of  degrees  of  effectiveness.  Even  if  we  only  save 
a  shop  in  our  own  street  or  stop  a  conspiracy  in  our 
own  trade,  or  get  a  Bill  to  punish  such  conspiracies 
pressed  by  our  own  member,  we  may  come  in  the 
nick  of  time  and  make  all  the  difference. 

To  vary  the  metaphor  to  a  military  one,  what  has 


108  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

happened  is  that  the  monopolists  have  attempted  an 
encircling  movement.  But  the  encircling  movement 
is  not  yet  complete.  Unless  we  do  something  it  will 
be  complete;  but  it  is  not  true  to  say  that  we  can  do 
nothing  to  prevent  it  being  completed.  We  are  in 
>  favour  of  striking  out,  of  making  sorties  or  sallies, 
of  trying  to  pierce  certain  points  in  the  line  (far 
enough  apart  and  chosen  for  their  weakness),  of 
breaking  through  the  gap  in  the  uncompleted  circle. 
Most  people  around  us  are  for  surrender  to  the  sur¬ 
prise;  precisely  because  it  was  to  them  so  complete 
a  surprise.  Yesterday  they  denied  that  the  enemy 
could  encircle.  The  day  before  yesterday  they  denied 
that  the  enemy  could  exist.  They  are  paralysed  as  by  a 
prodigy.  But  just  as  we  never  agreed  that  the  thing 
was  impossible,  so  we  do  not  now  agree  that  it  is 
irresistible.  Action  ought  to  have  been  taken  long 
ago;  but  action  can  still  be  taken  now.  That  is  why 
it  is  worth  while  to  dwell  on  the  diverse  expedients 
already  given  as  examples.  A  chain  is  as  strong  as  its 
weakest  link;  a  battleline  is  as  strong  as  its  weak¬ 
est  man;  an  encircling  movement  is  as  strong  as  its 
weakest  point,  the  point  at  which  the  circle  may  still 
be  broken.  Thus,  to  begin  with,  if  anybody  asks  me 
in  this  matter,  “What  am  I  to  do  now?”  I  answer, 
“Do  anything,  however  small,  that  will  prevent  the 
completion  of  the  work  of  capitalist  combination.  Do 
anything  that  will  even  delay  that  completion.  Save 
one  shop  out  of  a  hundred  shops.  Save  one  croft  out 


109 


THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS 

of  a  hundred  crofts.  Keep  open  one  door  out  of  a 
hundred  doors;  for  so  long  as  one  door  is  open,  we 
are  not  in  prison  Throw  up  one  barricade  in  their 
way,  and  you  will  soon  see  whether  it  is  the  way  the 
world  is  going.  Put  one  spoke  in  their  wheel,  and 
you  will  soon  see  whether  it  is  the  wheel  of  fate.” 
For  it  is  of  the  essence  of  their  enormous  and  un¬ 
natural  effort  that  a  small  failure  is  as  big  as  a  big 
failure  The  modern  commercial  combine  has  a  great 
many  points  in  common  with  a  big  balloon.  It  is 
swollen  and  yet  it  is  swollen  with  levity;  it  climbs 
and  yet  it  drifts;  above  all,  it  is  full  of  gas,  and  gen¬ 
erally  of  poison  gas.  But  the  resemblance  most  rele¬ 
vant  here  is  that  the  smallest  prick  will  shrivel  the 
biggest  balloon.  If  this  tendency  of  our  time  received 
anything  like  a  reasonably  definite  check,  I  believe 
the  whole  tendency  would  soon  begin  to  weaken  in 
its  preposterous  prestige.  Until  monopoly  is  monop¬ 
olist  it  is  nothing.  Until  the  combine  can  combine 
everything,  it  is  nothing.  Ahab  has  not  his  kingdom 
sc  long  as  Naboth  has  his  vineyard.  Haman  will  not 
be  happy  in  the  palace  while  Mordecai  is  sitting  in 
the  gate.  A  hundred  tales  of  human  history  are  there 
to  show  that  tendencies  can  be  turned  back,  and  that 
one  stumbling-block  can  be  the  turning-point.  The 
sands  of  time  are  simply  dotted  with  single  stakes 
that  have  thus  marked  the  turn  of  the  tide.  The  first 
step  towards  ultimately  winning  is  to  make  sure  that 
the  enemy  does  not  win,  if  it  be  only  that  he  does 


110  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

not  win  everywhere.  Then,  when  we  have  halted  his 
rush,  and  perhaps  fought  it  to  a  standstill,  we  may 
begin  a  general  counter-attack.  The  nature  of  that 
counter-attack  I  shall  next  proceed  to  consider.  In 
other  words,  I  will  try  to  explain  to  the  old  clergy¬ 
man  caught  in  the  net  (whose  sufferings  are  ever  be¬ 
fore  my  eyes)  what  it  will  no  doubt  comfort  him  to 
know:  that  he  was  wrong  from  the  first  in  thinking 
there  could  be  no  net;  that  he  is  wrong  now  in  think¬ 
ing  there  is  no  escape  from  the  net;  and  that  he  will 
never  know  how  wrong  he  was  till  he  finds  he  has  a 
net  of  his  own,  and  is  once  more  a  fisher  of  men. 

I  began  by  enunciating  the  paradox  that  one  way 
of  supporting  small  shops  would  be  to  support  them. 
Everybody  could  do  it,  but  nobody  can  imagine  it 
being  done.  In  one  sense  nothing  is  so  simple,  and 
in  another  nothing  is  so  hard.  I  went  on  to  point 
out  that  without  any  sweeping  change  at  all,  the 
mere  modification  of  existing  laws  would  probably 
call  thousands  of  little  shops  into  life  and  activity. 
I  may  have  occasion  to  return  to  the  little  shops  at 
greater  length;  but  for  the  moment  I  am  only  running 
rapidly  through  certain  separate  examples,  to  show 
that  the  citadel  of  plutocracy  could  even  now  be  at¬ 
tacked  from  many  different  sides.  It  could  be  met 
by  a  concerted  effort  in  the  open  field  of  competition. 
It  could  be  checked  by  the  creation  or  even  correction 
of  a  large  number  of  little  laws.  Thirdly,  it  could  be 
attacked  by  the  more  sweeping  operation  of  larger 


THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS  111 

laws.  But  when  we  come  to  these,  even  at  this  stage, 
we  also  come  into  collision  with  larger  questions. 

The  common  sense  of  Christendom,  for  ages  on 
end,  has  assumed  that  it  was  as  possible  to  punish 
cornering  as  to  punish  coining.  Yet  to  most  readers 
to-day  there  seems  a  sort  of  vital  contradiction, 
echoed  in  the  verbal  contradiction  of  saying,  “Put  not 
your  trust  in  Trusts.”  Yet  to  our  fathers  this  would 
not  seem  even  so  much  of  a  paradox  as  saying,  “Put 
not  your  trust  in  princes,”  but  rather  like  saying,  “Put 
not  your  trust  in  pirates.”  But  in  applying  this  to 
modern  conditions,  we  are  checked  first  by  a  very 
modern  sophistry. 

When  we  say  that  a  corner  should  be  treated  as  a 
conspiracy,  we  are  always  told  that  the  conspiracy 
is  too  elaborate  to  be  unravelled.  In  other  words, 
we  are  told  that  the  conspirators  are  too  conspira¬ 
torial  to  be  caught.  Now  it  is  exactly  at  this  point 
that  my  simple  and  childlike  confidence  in  the  busi¬ 
ness  expert  entirely  breaks  down.  My  attitude,  a  mo¬ 
ment  ago  trustful  and  confiding,  becomes  disrespect¬ 
ful  and  frivolous.  I  am  willing  to  agree  that  I  do  not 
know  much  about  the  details  of  business,  but  not  that 
nobody  could  possibly  ever  come  to  know  anything 
about  them.  I  am  willing  to  believe  that  there  are 
people  in  the  world  who  like  to  feel  that  they  depend 
for  the  bread  of  life  on  one  particular  bounder,  who 
probably  began  by  making  large  profits  on  short 
weight.  I  am  willing  to  believe  that  there  are  people 


112 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

so  strangely  constituted  that  they  like  to  see  a  great 
nation  held  up  by  a  small  gang,  more  lawless  than 
brigands  but  not  so  brave.  In  short,  I  am  willing  to 
admit  that  there  may  be  people  who  trust  in  Trusts. 
I  admit  it  with  tears,  like  those  of  the  benevolent 
captain  in  the  Bab  Ballads  who  said: 

“It’s  human  nature  p’raps;  if  so, 

Oh,  isn’t  human  nature  low?” 

I  myself  doubt  whether  it  is  quite  so  low  as  that;  but 
I  admit  the  possibility  of  this  utter  lowness;  I  admit 
it  with  weeping  and  lamentation.  But  when  they  tell 
me  it  would  be  impossible  to  find  out  whether  a  man 
is  making  a  Trust  or  not — that  is  quite  another  thing. 
My  demeanour  alters.  My  spirits  revive.  When  I  am 
told  that  if  cornering  were  a  crime  nobody  could  be 
convicted  of  that  crime — then  I  laugh;  nay,  I  jeer. 

A  murder  is  usually  committed,  we  may  infer, 
when  one  gentleman  takes  a  dislike  to  the  appearance 
of  another  gentleman  in  Piccadilly  Circus  at  eleven 
o  clock  in  the  morning;  and  steps  up  to  the  object 
of  his  distaste  and  dexterously  cuts  his  throat.  He 
then  walks  across  to  the  kind  policeman  who  is 
regulating  the  traffic,  and  draws  his  attention  to  the 
presence  of  the  corpse  on  the  pavement,  consulting 
him  about  how  to  dispose  of  the  encumbrance.  That 
is  apparently  how  these  people  expect  financial  crimes 
to  be  done,  in  order  to  be  discovered.  Sometimes  in- 


113 


THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS 

deed  they  are  done  almost  as  brazenly,  in  communi¬ 
ties  where  they  can  safely  be  discovered.  But  the  the¬ 
ory  of  legal  impotence  looks  very  extraordinary  when 
we  consider  the  sort  of  things  that  the  police  do  dis¬ 
cover.  Look  at  the  sort  of  murders  they  discover. 
An  utterly  ordinary  and  obscure  man  in  some  hole- 
and-corner  house  or  tenement  among  ten  thousand 
like  it,  washes  his  hands  in  a  sink  in  a  back  scullery; 
the  operation  taking  two  minutes.  The  police  can  dis¬ 
cover  that,  but  they  could  not  possibly  discover  the 
meeting  of  men  or  the  sending  of  messages  that  turn 
the  whole  commercial  world  upside  down.  They  can 
track  a  man  that  nobody  has  ever  heard  of  to  a  place 
where  nobody  knew  he  was  going,  to  do  something 
that  he  took  every  possible  precaution  that  nobody 
should  see.  But  they  cannot  keep  a  watch  on  a  man 
that  everybody  has  heard  of,  to  see  whether  he  com¬ 
municates  with  another  man  that  everybody  has  heard 
of,  in  order  to  do  something  that  nearly  everybody 
knows  he  is  trying  all  his  life  to  do.  They  can  tell  us 
all  about  the  movements  of  a  man  whose  own  wife  or 
partner  or  landlady  does  not  profess  to  know  his 
movements;  but  they  cannot  tell  when  a  great  com¬ 
bination  covering  half  the  earth  is  on  the  move.  Are 
the  police  really  so  foolish  as  this;  or  are  they  at 
once  so  foolish  and  so  wise?  Or  if  the  police  were  as 
helpless  as  Sherlock  Holmes  thought  them,  what 
about  Sherlock  Holmes?  What  about  the  ardent  ama¬ 
teur  detective  about  whom  all  of  us  have  read  and 


114  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

some  of  us  (alas!)  have  written.  Is  there  no  inspired 
sleuth  to  succeed  where  all  the  police  have  failed; 
and  prove  conclusively  from  a  greasy  spot  on  the 
tablecloth  that  Mr.  Rockefeller  is  interested  in  oil? 
Is  there  no  keen-faced  man  to  infer  from  the  late 
Lord  Leverhulme  buying  up  a  crowd  of  soap- 
businesses  that  he  was  interested  in  soap?  I  feel  in¬ 
clined  to  write  a  new  series  of  detective  stories  my¬ 
self,  about  the  discovery  of  these  obscure  and  cryptic 
things.  They  would  describe  Sherlock  Holmes  with  his 
monstrous  magnifying-glass  poring  over  a  paper  and 
making  out  one  of  the  headlines  letter  by  letter.  They 
would  show  us  Watson  standing  in  amazement  at  the 
discovery  of  the  Bank  of  England.  My  stories  would 
bear  the  traditional  sort  of  titles,  such  as  “The  Secret 
of  the  Skysign”  and  “The  Mystery  of  the  Mega¬ 
phone”  and  “The  Adventure  of  the  Unnoticed  Hoard¬ 
ing.” 

What  these  people  really  mean  is  that  they  can¬ 
not  imagine  cornering  being  treated  like  coining.  They 
cannot  imagine  attempted  forestalling,  or,  indeed, 
any  activity  of  the  rich,  coming  into  the  realm  of 
the  criminal  law  at  all.  It  would  give  them  a  shock 
to  think  of  such  men  subjected  to  such  tests.  I  will 
give  one  obvious  example.  The  science  of  finger¬ 
prints  is  perpetually  paraded  before  us  by  the  crimi¬ 
nologists  when  they  merely  want  to  glorify  their  not 
very  glorious  science.  Finger-prints  would  prove  as 
easily  whether  a  millionaire  had  used  a  pen  as  whether 


THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS  115 

a  housebreaker  had  used  a  jemmy.  They  might  show 
as  clearly  that  a  financier  had  used  a  telephone  as 
that  a  burglar  had  used  a  ladder.  But  if  we  began 
to  talk  about  taking  the  finger-prints  of  financiers, 
everybody  would  think  it  was  a  joke.  And  so  it  is:  a 
very  grim  joke.  The  laughter  that  leaps  up  spontane¬ 
ously  at  the  suggestion  is  itself  a  proof  that  nobody 
takes  seriously,  or  thinks  of  taking  seriously,  the  idea 
of  rich  men  and  poor  being  equal  before  the  law. 

That  is  the  reason  why  we  do  not  treat  Trust  mag¬ 
nates  and  monopolists  as  they  would  be  treated  under 
the  old  laws  of  popular  justice.  And  that  is  the  rea¬ 
son  why  I  take  their  case  at  this  stage,  and  in  this 
section  of  my  remarks,  along  with  such  apparently 
light  and  superficial  things  as  transferring  custom 
from  one  shop  to  another.  It  is  because  in  both  cases 
it  is  a  question  wholly  and  solely  of  moral  will;  and 
not  in  the  least,  in  any  sense,  a  question  of  economic 
law.  In  other  words,  it  is  a  lie  to  say  that  we  cannot 
make  a  law  to  imprison  monopolists,  or  pillory  mo¬ 
nopolists,  or  hang  monopolists  if  we  choose,  as  our 
fathers  did  before  us.  And  in  the  same  sense  it  is  a  lie 
to  say  that  we  cannot  help  buying  the  best  advertised 
goods  or  going  to  the  biggest  shop  or  falling  in,  in 
our  general  social  habits,  with  the  general  social 
trend.  We  could  help  it  in  a  hundred  ways;  from  the 
very  simple  one  of  walking  out  of  a  shop  to  the  more 
ceremonial  one  of  hanging  a  man  on  a  gallows.  If  we 
mean  that  we  do  not  want  to  help  it,  that  may  be  very 


116  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

true,  and  even  in  some  cases  very  right.  But  arresting 
a  forestaller  is  as  easy  as  falling  off  a  log  or  walking 
out  of  a  shop.  Putting  the  log-roller  in  prison  is  no 
more  impossible  than  walking  out  of  the  shop  is  im¬ 
possible;  and  it  is  highly  desirable  for  the  health  of 
this  discussion  that  we  should  realize  the  fact  from 
the  first.  Practically  about  half  of  the  recognized  ex¬ 
pedients  by  which  a  big  business  is  now  made  have 
been  marked  down  as  a  crime  in  some  community  of 
the  past;  and  could  be  so  marked  in  a  community  of 
the  future.  I  can  only  refer  to  them  here  in  the  most 
cursory  fashion.  One  of  them  is  the  process  against 
which  the  statesmen  of  the  most  respectable  party 
rave  day  and  night  so  long  as  they  can  pretend  that 
it  is  only  done  by  foreigners.  It  is  called  Dumping. 
There  is  a  policy  of  deliberately  selling  at  a  loss  to 
destroy  another  man’s  market.  Another  is  a  process 
against  which  the  same  statesmen  of  the  same  party 
actually  have  attempted  to  legislate,  so  long  as  it  was 
confined  to  moneylenders.  Unfortunately,  however,  it 
is  not  by  any  means  confined  to  moneylenders.  It  is 
the  trick  of  tying  a  poorer  man  up  in  a  tangle  of  all 
sorts  of  obligations  that  he  cannot  ultimately  dis¬ 
charge,  except  by  selling  his  shop  or  business.  It  is 
done  in  one  form  by  giving  to  the  desperate  things  on 
the  instalment  plan  or  on  long  credit.  All  these  con¬ 
spiracies  I  would  have  tried  as  we  try  a  conspiracy  to 
overthrow  the  State  or  to  shoot  the  King.  We  do  not 
expect  the  man  to  write  the  King  a  post-card,  telling 


THE  TYRANNY  OF  TRUSTS  117 

him  he  is  to  be  shot,  or  to  give  warning  in  the  news¬ 
papers  of  the  Day  of  Revolution.  Such  plots  have  al¬ 
ways  been  judged  in  the  only  way  in  which  they  can 
be  judged:  by  the  use  of  common  sense  as  to  the  ex¬ 
istence  of  a  purpose  and  the  apparent  existence  of  a 
plan.  But  we  shall  never  have  a  real  civic  sense  until 
it  is  once  more  felt  that  the  plot  of  three  citizens 
against  one  citizen  is  a  crime,  as  well  as  the  plot  of 
one  citizen  against  three.  In  other  words,  private 
property  ought  to  be  protected  against  private  crime, 
just  as  public  order  is  protected  against  private  judg¬ 
ment.  But  private  property  ought  to  be  protected 
against  much  bigger  things  than  burglars  and  pick¬ 
pockets.  It  needs  protection  against  the  plots  of  a 
whole  plutocracy.  It  needs  defence  against  the  rich, 
who  are  now  generally  the  rulers  who  ought  to  defend 
it.  It  may  not  be  difficult  to  explain  why  they  do  not 
defend  it.  But  anyhow,  in  all  these  cases,  the  difficulty 
is  in  imagining  people  wanting  to  do  it;  not  in  imag¬ 
ining  people  doing  it.  By  all  means  let  people  say 
that  they  do  not  think  the  ideal  of  the  Distributive 
State  is  worth  the  risk  or  even  worth  the  trouble. 
But  do  not  let  them  say  that  no  human  being  in  the 
past  has  ever  taken  any  risk;  or  that  no  children  of 
Adam  are  capable  of  taking  any  trouble.  If  they 
chose  to  take  half  as  much  risk  to  achieve  justice  as 
they  have  already  taken  to  achieve  degradation,  if 
they  toiled  half  as  laboriously  to  make  anything  beau¬ 
tiful  as  they  toiled  to  make  everything  ugly,  if  they 


118  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

had  served  their  God  as  they  have  served  their  Pork 
King  and  their  Petrol  King,  the  success  of  our  whole 
Distributive  democracy  would  stare  at  the  world  like 
one  of  their  flaming  sky-signs  and  scrape  the  sky  like 
one  of  their  crazy  towers.

THE  SIMPLE  TRUTH 

All  of  us,  or  at  least  all  those  of  my  generation, 
heard  in  our  youth  an  anecdote  about  George  Ste¬ 
phenson,  the  discoverer  of  the  Locomotive  Steam- 
Engine.  It  was  said  that  some  miserable  rustic  raised 
the  objection  that  it  would  be  very  awkward  if  a  cow 
strayed  on  the  railway  line,  whereupon  the  inventor 
replied,  “It  would  be  very  awkward  for  the  cow.” 
It  is  supremely  characteristic  of  his  age  and  school 
that  it  never  seemed  to  occur  to  anybody  that  it 
might  be  rather  awkward  for  the  rustic  who  owned 
the  cow. 

Long  before  we  heard  that  anecdote,  however,  we 
had  probably  heard  another  and  more  exciting  anec¬ 
dote  called  “Jack  and  the  Beanstalk.”  That  story  be¬ 
gins  with  the  strange  and  startling  words,  “There  once 
was  a  poor  woman  who  had  a  cow.”  It  would  be  a 
wild  paradox  in  modern  England  to  imagine  that  a 
poor  woman  could  have  a  cow;  but  things  seem  to 
have  been  different  in  ruder  and  more  superstitious 
ages.  Anyhow,  she  evidently  would  not  have  had  a 
cow  long  in  the  sympathetic  atmosphere  of  Stephen¬ 
son  and  his  steam-engine.  The  train  went  forward,  the 
cow  was  killed  in  due  course;  and  the  state  of  mind 

121 


122  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

of  the  old  woman  was  described  as  the  Depression  of 
Agriculture.  But  everybody  was  so  happy  in  traveling 
in  trains  and  making  it  awkward  for  cows  that  no¬ 
body  noticed  that  other  difficulties  remained.  When 
wars  or  revolutions  cut  us  off  from  cows,  the  indus¬ 
trialists  discovered  that  milk  does  not  come  originally 
from  cans.  On  this  fact  some  of  us  have  founded  the 
idea  that  the  cow  (and  even  the  miserable  rustic) 
have  a  use  in  society,  and  have  been  prepared  to  con¬ 
cede  her  as  much  as  three  acres.  But  it  will  be  well  at 
this  stage  to  repeat  that  we  do  not  propose  that  every 
acre  should  be  covered  with  cows;  and  do  not  pro¬ 
pose  to  eliminate  townspeople  as  they  would  eliminate 
rustics.  On  many  minor  points  we  might  have  to  com¬ 
promise  with  conditions,  especially  at  first.  But  even 
my  ideal,  if  ever  I  found  it  at  last,  would  be  what 
some  call  a  compromise.  Only  I  think  it  more  accurate 
to  call  it  a  balance.  For  I  do  not  think  that  the  sun 
compromises  with  the  rain  when  together  they  make  a 
garden;  or  that  the  rose  that  grows  there  is  a  com¬ 
promise  between  green  and  red.  But  I  mean  that  even 
my  Utopia  would  contain  different  things  of  differ¬ 
ent  types  holding  on  different  tenures;  that  as  in 
a  medieval  state  there  were  some  peasants,  some  mon¬ 
asteries,  some  common  land,  some  private  land,  some 
town  guilds,  and  so  on,  so  in  my  modern  state  there 
would  be  some  things  nationalized,  some  machines 
owned  corporately,  some  guilds  sharing  common  prof¬ 
its,  and  so  on,  as  well  as  many  absolute  individual 


THE  SIMPLE  TRUTH  123 

owners,  where  such  individual  owners  are  most  possi¬ 
ble.  But  with  these  latter  it  is  well  to  begin,  because 
they  are  meant  to  give,  and  nearly  always  do  give,  the 
standard  and  tone  of  the  society. 

Among  the  things  we  have  heard  a  thousand  times 
is  the  statement  that  the  English  are  a  slow  people,  a 
cautious  people,  a  conservative  people,  and  so  on. 
When  we  have  heard  a  thing  as  many  times  as  that, 
we  generally  either  accept  it  as  a  truism,  or  sud¬ 
denly  see  that  it  is  quite  untrue.  And  in  this  case 
it  is  quite  untrue.  The  real  peculiarity  of  Eng¬ 
land  is  that  it  is  the  only  country  on  earth  that 
has  not  got  a  conservative  class.  There  are  a  large 
number,  possibly  a  majority,  of  people  who  call  them¬ 
selves  conservative.  But  the  more  they  are  examined, 
the  less  conservative  they  will  appear.  The  com¬ 
mercial  class  that  is  in  a  special  sense  capitalist  is  in 
its  nature  the  very  opposite  of  conservative.  By  its 
own  profession,  it  proclaims  that  it  is  perpetually  us¬ 
ing  new  methods  and  seeking  for  new  markets.  To 
some  of  us  there  seems  to  be  something  exceedingly 
stale  about  all  that  novelty.  But  that  is  because  of 
the  type  of  mind  that  is  inventing,  not  because  it  does 
not  mean  to  invent.  From  the  biggest  financier  float¬ 
ing  a  company  to  the  smallest  tout  peddling  a  sewing- 
machine,  the  same  ideal  prevails.  It  must  always  be 
a  new  company,  especially  after  what  has  generally 
happened  to  the  old  company.  And  the  sewing-machine 
must  always  be  a  new  sort  of  sewing-machine,  even 


124  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

if  it  is  the  sort  that  does  not  sew.  But  while  this  is 
obvious  of  the  mere  capitalist,  it  is  equally  true  of 
the  pure  oligarch.  Whatever  else  an  aristocracy  is, 
an  aristocracy  is  never  conservative.  By  its  very  na¬ 
ture  it  goes  by  fashion  rather  than  by  tradition.  Men 
living  a  life  of  leisure  and  luxury  are  always  eager  for 
new  things;  we  might  fairly  say  they  would  be  fools 
if  they  weren’t.  And  the  English  aristocrats  are  by  no 
means  fools.  They  can  proudly  claim  to  have  played 
a  great  part  in  every  stage  of  the  intellectual  progress 
that  has  brought  us  to  our  present  ruin. 

The  first  fact  about  establishing  an  English  peas¬ 
antry  is  that  it  is  establishing,  for  the  first  time  for 
many  centuries,  a  traditional  class.  The  absence  of 
such  a  class  will  be  found  to  be  a  very  terrible  fact,  if 
the  tug  really  becomes  between  Bolshevism  and  the 
historic  ideal  of  property.  But  the  converse  is  equally 
true  and  much  more  comforting.  This  difference  in  the 
quality  means  that  the  change  will  begin  to  be  ef¬ 
fective  merely  by  quantity.  I  mean  that  we  have  not 
been  concerned  so  much  with  the  strength  or  weak¬ 
ness  of  a  peasantry,  as  with  presence  or  absence 
of  a  peasantry.  As  the  society  has  suffered  from 
its  mere  absence,  so  the  society  will  begin  to  change 
by  its  mere  presence.  It  will  be  a  somewhat  different 
England  in  which  the  peasant  has  to  be  considered 
at  all.  It  will  begin  to  alter  the  look  of  things,  even 
when  politicians  think  about  peasants  as  often  as  they 


THE  SIMPLE  TRUTH  125 

do  about  doctors.  They  have  been  known  even  to 
think  about  soldiers. 

The  primary  case  for  the  peasant  is  of  a  stark  and 
almost  savage  simplicity.  A  man  in  England  might 
live  on  the  land,  if  he  did  not  have  rent  to  pay  to 
the  landlord  and  wages  to  pay  to  the  labourer.  He 
would  therefore  be  better  off,  even  on  a  small  scale, 
if  he  were  his  own  landlord  and  his  own  labourer. 
But  there  are  obviously  certain  further  considera¬ 
tions,  and  to  my  mind  certain  common  misconcep¬ 
tions,  to  which  the  following  notes  refer  roughly  in 
their  order.  In  the  first  place,  of  course,  it  is  one  thing 
to  say  that  this  is  desirable,  and  another  that  it  is 
desired.  And  in  the  first  place,  as  will  be  seen,  I  do  not 
deny  that  if  it  is  to  be  desired,  it  can  hardly  be  as  a 
mere  indulgence  is  desired;  there  will  undoubtedly  be 
required  a  certain  spirit  of  effort  and  sacrifice  for  the 
sake  of  an  acute  national  necessity,  if  we  are  to  ask 
any  landlord  to  do  without  rent  or  any  farmer  to  do 
without  assistance.  But  at  least  there  really  is  a  crisis 
and  a  necessity;  to  such  an  extent  that  the  squire 
would  often  be  only  remitting  a  debt  which  he  has 
already  written  off  as  a  bad  debt,  and  the  employer 
only  sacrificing  the  service  of  men  who  are  already 
on  strike.  Still,  we  shall  need  the  virtues  that  belong 
to  a  crisis;  and  it  will  be  well  to  make  the  fact  clear. 
Next,  while  there  is  all  the  difference  between  the  de¬ 
sirable  and  the  desired,  I  would  point  out  that  even 


126 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


now  this  normal  life  is  more  desired  than  many  sup¬ 
pose.  It  is  perhaps  subconsciously  desired;  but  I  think 
it  worth  while  to  throw  out  a  few  suggestions  that 
may  bring  it  to  the  surface.  Lastly,  there  is  a  miscon¬ 
ception  about  what  is  meant  by  “living  on  the  land’' 
— and  I  have  added  some  suggestions  about  how  much 
more  desirable  it  is  than  many  suppose. 

I  shall  consider  these  separate  aspects  of  agricul¬ 
tural  distributism  more  or  less  in  the  order  in  which 
I  have  just  noted  them;  but  here  in  the  preliminary 
note  I  am  concerned  only  with  the  primary  fact.  If 
we  could  create  a  peasantry  we  could  create  a  con¬ 
servative  populace;  and  he  would  be  a  bold  man  who 
should  undertake  to  tell  us  how  the  present  industrial 
deadlock  in  the  great  cities  is  to  produce  a  conserva¬ 
tive  populace.  I  am  well  aware  that  many  would  call 
the  conservatism  by  coarser  names;  and  say  that 
peasants  are  stupid  and  stick-in-the-mud  and  tied  to 
dull  and  dreary  existence.  I  know  it  is  said  that  a  man 
must  find  it  monotonous  to  do  the  twenty  things  that 
are  done  on  a  farm,  whereas,  of  course,  he  always 
finds  it  uproariously  funny  and  festive  to  do  one 
thing  hour  after  hour  and  day  after  day  in  a  factory. 
I  know  that  the  same  people  also  make  exactly  the 
contrary  comment;  and  say  it  is  selfish  and  avaricious 
for  the  peasant  to  be  so  intensely  interested  in  his  own 
farm,  instead  of  showing,  like  the  proletarians  of 
modern  industrialism,  a  selfless  and  romantic  loyalty 
to  somebody  else’s  factory,  and  an  ascetic  self-sacrifice 


THE  SIMPLE  TRUTH  127 

in  making  profits  for  somebody  else.  Giving  each  of 
these  claims  of  modern  capitalism  their  due  weight,  it 
is  still  permissible  to  say  that  in  so  far  as  the  peasant 
proprietor  is  certainly  tenacious  of  the  peasant  prop¬ 
erty,  is  concentrated  on  the  interest  or  content  with 
the  dullness,  as  the  case  may  be,  he  does,  in  fact, 
constitute  a  solid  block  of  private  property  which  can 
be  counted  on  to  resist  Communism;  which  is  not 
only  more  than  can  be  said  of  the  proletariat,  but  is 
very  much  more  than  any  capitalists  say  of  them.  I 
do  not  believe  that  the  proletariat  is  honeycombed 
with  Bolshevism  (if  honey  be  an  apt  metaphor  for 
that  doctrine),  but  if  there  is  any  truth  in  the  news¬ 
paper  fears  on  that  subject,  it  would  certainly  seem 
that  large  properties  cannot  prevent  the  thing  hap¬ 
pening,  whereas  small  properties  can.  But,  as  a  mat¬ 
ter  of  fact,  all  experience  is  against  the  assertion  that 
peasants  are  dreary  and  degraded  savages,  crawling 
about  on  all  fours  and  eating  grass  like  the  beasts  of 
the  field.  All  over  the  world,  for  instance,  there  are 
peasant  dances;  and  the  dances  of  peasants  are  like 
dances  of  kings  and  queens.  The  popular  dance  is 
much  more  stately  and  ceremonial  and  full  of  human 
dignity  than  is  the  aristocratic  dance.  In  many  a  mod¬ 
ern  countryside  the  countryfolk  may  still  be  found 
on  high  festivals  wearing  caps  like  crowns  and  using 
gestures  like  a  religious  ritual,  while  the  castle  or 
chateau  of  the  lords  and  ladies  is  already  full  of  peo¬ 
ple  waddling  about  like  monkeys  to  the  noises  made 


128  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

by  negroes.  All  over  Europe  peasants  have  produced 
the  embroideries  and  the  handicrafts  which  were  dis¬ 
covered  with  delight  by  artists  when  they  had  long 
been  neglected  by  aristocrats.  These  people  are  not 
conservative  merely  in  a  negative  sense;  though  there 
is  great  value  in  that  which  is  negative  when  it  is 
also  defensive.  They  are  also  conservative  in  a  posi¬ 
tive  sense;  they  conserve  customs  that  do  not  perish 
like  fashions,  and  crafts  less  ephemeral  than  those 
artistic  movements  which  so  very  soon  cease  to 
move.  The  Bolshevists,  I  believe,  have  invented 
something  which  they  call  Proletarian  Art,  upon 
what  principle  I  cannot  imagine;  save  that  they  seem 
to  have  a  mysterious  pride  in  calling  themselves  a 
proletariat  when  they  claim  to  be  no  longer  prole¬ 
tarian.  I  rather  think  it  is  merely  the  reluctance  of 
the  half-educated  to  relinquish  the  use  of  a  long  word. 
Anyhow,  there  never  has  been  in  this  world  any  such 
thing  as  Proletarian  Art.  But  there  has  most  em¬ 
phatically  been  such  a  thing  as  Peasant  Art. 

I  suppose  that  what  is  really  meant  is  Communist 
Art;  and  that  phrase  alone  will  reveal  much.  I  sup¬ 
pose  a  truly  communal  art  would  consist  in  a  hun¬ 
dred  men  hanging  on  to  one  huge  paint-brush  like  a 
battering-ram,  and  steering  it  across  some  vast  canvas 
with  the  curves  and  lurches  and  majestic  hesitations 
that  would  express,  in  darkly  outlined  forms,  the  com¬ 
posite  mind  of  the  community.  Peasants  have  pro¬ 
duced  art  because  they  were  communal  but  not  com- 


THE  SIMPLE  TRUTH 


129 


munist.  Custom  and  a  corporate  tradition  gave  unity 
to  their  art;  but  each  man  was  a  separate  artist.  It  is 
that  satisfaction  of  the  creative  instinct  in  the  indi¬ 
vidual  that  makes  the  peasantry  as  a  whole  content 
and  therefore  conservative.  A  multitude  of  men  are 
standing  on  their  own  feet,  because  they  are  standing 
on  their  own  land.  But  in  our  country,  alas,  the  land- 
owners  have  been  standing  upon  nothing,  except  what 
they  have  trampled  underfoot.

VOWS  AND  VOLUNTEERS 

We  have  sometimes  been  asked  why  we  do  not  ad¬ 
mire  advertisers  quite  so  much  as  they  admire  them¬ 
selves.  One  answer  is  that  it  is  of  their  very  nature  to 
admire  themselves.  And  it  is  of  the  very  nature  of  our 
task  that  people  must  be  taught  to  criticize  them¬ 
selves;  or  rather  (preferably)  to  kick  themselves. 
They  talk  about  Truth  in  Advertising;  but  there  can¬ 
not  be  any  such  thing  in  the  sharp  sense  in  which  we 
need  truth  in  politics.  It  is  impossible  to  put  in  the 
cheery  terms  of  “publicity”  either  the  truth  about 
how  bad  things  are,  or  the  truth  about  how  hard  it 
will  be  to  cure  them.  No  advertiser  is  so  truthful  as 
to  say,  “Do  your  best  with  our  rotten  old  typewriter; 
we  can’t  get  anything  better  just  now.”  But  we  have 
really  got  to  say,  “Do  your  best  with  your  rotten  old 
machine  of  production ;  don’t  let  it  fall  to  pieces  too 
suddenly.”  We  seldom  see  a  gay  and  conspicuous 
hoarding  inscribed,  “You  are  in  for  a  rough  time  if 
you  use  our  new  kitchen-range.”  But  we  have  really 
got  to  say  to  our  friends,  “You  are  in  for  a  rough 
time  if  you  start  new  farms  on  your  own;  but  it  is  the 
right  thing.”  We  cannot  pretend  to  be  offering  merely 
comforts  and  conveniences.  Whatever  our  ultimate 


130 


VOWS  AND  VOLUNTEERS  131 

view  of  labour-saving  machinery,  we  cannot  offer  our 
ideal  as  a  labour-saving  machine.  There  is  no  more 
question  of  comfort  than  there  is  for  a  man  in  a  fire, 
a  battle,  or  a  shipwreck.  There  is  no  way  out  of  the 
danger  except  the  dangerous  way. 

The  sort  of  call  that  must  be  made  on  the  modern 
English  is  the  sort  of  call  that  is  made  before  a  great 
war  or  a  great  revolution.  If  the  trumpet  give  an  un¬ 
certain  sound — but  it  must  be  unmistakably  the 
sound  of  a  trumpet.  The  megaphone  of  mere  mercan¬ 
tile  self-satisfaction  is  merely  loud  and  not  in  the  least 
clear.  In  its  nature  it  is  saying  smooth  things,  even  if 
it  is  roaring  them;  it  is  like  one  whispering  soft  noth¬ 
ings,  even  if  its  whisper  is  a  horrible  yell.  How  can 
advertisement  bid  men  prepare  themselves  for  a  bat¬ 
tle?  How  can  publicity  talk  in  the  language  of  public 
spirit?  It  cannot  say,  “Buy  land  at  Blinkington-on- 
Sea  and  prepare  yourself  for  the  battle  with  stones 
and  thistles.”  It  cannot  give  a  certain  sound,  like  the 
old  tocsin  that  rang  for  fire  and  flood,  and  tell  the 
people  of  Puddleton  that  they  are  in  danger  of  fam¬ 
ine.  To  do  men  justice,  no  man  did  announce  the 
needs  of  Kitchener’s  Army  like  the  comforts  of  the 
kitchen-range.  We  did  not  say  to  the  recruits,  “Spend 
your  holiday  at  Mons.”  We  did  not  say,  “Try  our 
trenches;  they  are  a  treat.”  We  made  some  sort  of  at¬ 
tempt  to  appeal  to  better  things.  We  have  to  make 
that  appeal  again;  and  in  the  face  of  worse  things.  It 
is  this  that  is  made  so  difficult  by  the  whole  tone  of 


132  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

advertisement.  For  the  next  thing  we  have  to  con¬ 
sider  is  the  need  of  independent  individual  action 
on  a  large  scale.  We  want  to  make  the  need  known, 
as  the  need  for  recruits  was  made  known.  Education 
was  too  commercial  in  origin,  and  has  allowed  itself 
to  be  largely  swamped  by  commercial  advertisement. 
It  came  too  much  from  the  town;  and  now  it  is 
nearly  driven  from  the  town.  Education  really 
meant  the  teaching  of  town  things  to  country  people 
who  did  not  want  to  learn  them.  I  suggest  that  edu¬ 
cation  should  now  mean  the  teaching  of  country 
things  to  town  people  who  do  want  to  learn  them.  I 
quite  admit  it  would  be  much  better  to  begin  at 
least  with  those  who  really  want  it.  But  I  also  main¬ 
tain  that  there  are  really  a  great  many  people  in  town 
and  country  who  do  really  want  it. 

Whether  we  look  forward  to  an  Agrarian  Law  or 
no,  whether  our  notion  of  distribution  is  rigid  or 
rough  and  ready,  whether  we  believe  in  compensation 
or  confiscation,  whether  we  look  for  this  law  or  that 
law,  we  ought  not  to  sit  down  and  wait  for  any  law 
at  all.  While  the  grass  grows  the  steed  has  got  to  show 
that  he  wants  grass:  the  steed  has  got  to  explain  that 
he  is  really  a  graminivorous  quadruped.  The  fulfil¬ 
ment  of  parliamentary  promises  grows  rather  slower 
than  grass;  and  if  nothing  is  done  before  the  comple¬ 
tion  of  what  is  called  a  constitutional  process,  we  shall 
be  about  as  near  to  Distributism  as  a  Labour  politi- 


VOWS  AND  VOLUNTEERS 


133 


cian  is  to  Socialism.  It  seems  to  me  first  necessary  to 
revive  the  medieval  or  moral  method,  and  call  for 
volunteers. 

The  English  could  do  what  the  Irish  did.  They 
could  make  laws  by  obeying  them.  If  we  are,  like  the 
original  Sinn  Feiners,  to  anticipate  legal  change  by 
social  agreement,  we  want  two  sorts  of  volunteers,  in 
order  to  make  the  experiment  on  the  spot.  We  want  to 
find  out  how  many  peasants  there  are,  actual  or  po¬ 
tential,  who  would  take  over  the  responsibility  of 
small  farms,  for  the  sake  of  self-sufficiency,  of  real 
property,  and  of  saving  England  in  a  desperate  hour. 
We  want  to  know  how  many  landlords  there  are  who 
would  now  give  or  sell  cheaply  their  land  to  be  cut 
up  into  a  number  of  such  farms.  Honestly,  I  think  the 
landlord  would  have  the  best  of  the  bargain.  Or  rather 
1  think  that  the  peasant  would  have  the  hardest  and 
most  heroic  part  of  the  bargain.  Sometimes  it  would 
practically  pay  the  landlord  to  chuck  the  land  alto¬ 
gether,  since  he  is  paying  out  to  something  that  does 
not  pay  him  back.  But  in  any  case,  everybody  has  got 
to  realize  that  the  situation  is,  in  no  cant  phrases,  one 
for  heroic  remedies.  It  is  impossible  to  disguise  that 
the  man  who  gets  the  land,  even  more  than  the  man 
who  gives  up  the  land,  will  have  to  be  something  of  a 
hero.  We  shall  be  told  that  heroes  do  not  grow  on 
every  hedgerow,  that  we  cannot  find  enough  to  defend 
all  our  hedges.  We  raised  three  million  heroes  with  the 


134 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

blast  of  a  bugle  but  a  few  years  ago;  and  the  trumpet 
we  hear  to-day  is  in  a  more  terrible  sense  the  trump  of 
doom. 

We  want  a  popular  appeal  for  volunteers  to  save 
the  land;  exactly  as  volunteers  in  1914  were  wanted 
to  save  the  country.  But  we  do  not  want  the  appeal 
weakened  by  that  weak-minded,  that  wearisome,  that 
dismal  and  deplorable  thing  that  the  newspapers  call 
Optimism.  We  are  not  asking  babies  to  look  pleasant 
while  their  photographs  are  taken;  we  are  asking 
grown  men  to  meet  a  crisis  as  grave  as  a  great  war. 
We  are  not  asking  people  to  cut  a  coupon  out  of  a 
newspaper,  but  to  carve  a  farm  out  of  a  trackless 
waste;  and  if  it  is  to  be  successful,  it  must  be  faced 
in  something  of  the  stubborn  spirit  of  the  old  fulfil¬ 
ment  of  a  vow.  St.  Francis  showed  his  followers  the 
way  to  a  greater  happiness;  but  he  did  not  tell  them 
that  a  wandering  and  homeless  life  would  mean 
Everything  as  Nice  as  Mother  Makes  It;  nor  did 
he  advertise  it  on  hoardings  as  a  Home  From  Home. 
But  we  live  in  a  time  when  it  is  harder  for  a  free  man 
to  make  a  home  than  it  was  for  a  medieval  ascetic  to 
do  without  one. 

The  quarrel  about  the  Limehouse  slums  was  a 
working  model  of  the  problem — if  we  can  talk  of  a 
working  model  of  something  that  does  not  work,  and 
something  on  which  only  a  madman  would  model 
anything.  The  slum-dwellers  actually  and  definitely 
say  that  they  prefer  their  slums  to  the  blocks  of  flats 


VOWS  AND  VOLUNTEERS  135 

provided  as  a  refuge  from  the  slums.  And  they  prefer 
them,  it  is  stated,  because  the  old  homes  had  back¬ 
yards  in  which  they  could  pursue  “their  hobbies  of 
bird-fancying  and  poultry-rearing.”  When  offered 
other  opportunities  on  some  scheme  of  allotment,  they 
had  the  hideous  depravity  to  say  that  they  liked 
fences  round  their  private  yards.  So  awful  and  over¬ 
whelming  is  the  Red  torrent  of  Communism  as  it  boils 
through  the  brains  of  the  working  classes. 

Now,  of  course,  it  might  conceivably  be  necessary, 
in  some  wild  congestion  and  convulsion,  for  people’s 
houses  to  be  piled  on  top  of  each  other  for  ever,  in  the 
form  of  a  tower  of  flats.  And  so  it  might  be  necessary 
for  men  to  climb  on  other  men’s  shoulders  in  a  flood 
or  to  get  out  of  a  chasm  cloven  by  an  earthquake. 
And  it  is  logically  conceivable,  and  even  mathemati¬ 
cally  correct,  that  we  might  thin  the  crowds  in  the 
London  streets,  if  we  could  thus  arrange  men  verti¬ 
cally  instead  of  horizontally.  If  there  were  only  some 
expedient  by  which  a  man  might  walk  about  with  an¬ 
other  man  standing  above  him,  and  another  above 
that,  and  so  on,  it  would  save  a  great  deal  of  jostling. 
Men  are  arranged  like  that  in  acrobatic  perform¬ 
ances;  and  a  course  of  such  acrobatics  might  be  made 
compulsory  in  all  the  schools.  It  is  a  picture  that 
pleases  me  very  much,  as  a  picture.  I  look  forward  (in 
spirit  of  art  for  art’s  sake)  to  seeing  such  a  living 
tower  moving  majestically  down  the  Strand.  I  like  to 
think  of  the  time  of  true  social  organization,  when  all 


136  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

the  clerks  of  Messrs.  Boodle  &  Bunkham  shall  no 
longer  come  up  in  their  present  random  and  straggling 
fashion,  each  from  his  little  suburban  villa.  They  shall 
not  even,  as  in  the  immediate  and  intermediary  stage 
of  the  Servile  State,  march  in  a  well-drilled  column 
from  the  dormitory  in  one  part  of  London,  to  the  em¬ 
porium  in  the  other.  No,  a  nobler  vision  has  arisen 
before  me  into  the  very  heights  of  heaven.  A  toppling 
pagoda  of  clerks,  one  balanced  on  the  top  of  another, 
moves  down  the  street,  perhaps  making  acrobatic  pat¬ 
terns  in  the  air  as  it  moves,  to  illustrate  the  perfect 
discipline  of  its  social  machinery.  All  that  would  be 
very  impressive;  and  it  really  would,  among  other 
things,  economize  space.  But  if  one  of  the  men  near 
the  top  of  that  swaying  tower  were  to  say  that  he 
hoped  some  day  to  be  able  to  revisit  the  earth,  I 
should  sympathize  with  his  sense  of  exile.  If  he  were 
to  say  that  it  is  natural  to  man  to  walk  on  the  earth, 
I  should  find  myself  in  agreement  with  his  school  of 
philosophy.  If  he  were  to  say  that  it  was  very  difficult 
to  look  after  chickens  in  that  acrobatic  attitude  and 
altitude,  I  should  think  his  difficulty  a  real  one.  At 
first  it  might  be  retorted  that  bird-fancying  would  be 
even  more  appropriate  to  such  an  airy  perch,  but  in 
practice  those  birds  would  be  very  fancy  birds.  Fi¬ 
nally,  if  he  said  that  keeping  chickens  that  laid  eggs 
was  a  worthy  and  valuable  social  work,  much  more 
worthy  and  valuable  than  serving  Messrs.  Boodle  & 
Bunkham  with  the  most  perfect  discipline  and  organ- 


VOWS  AND  VOLUNTEERS  137 

ization,  I  should  agree  with  that  sentiment  most  of 
all. 

Now  the  whole  of  our  modern  problem  is  very  dif¬ 
ficult,  and  though  in  one  way  the  agricultural  part 
of  it  is  much  the  simplest,  in  another  way  it  is  by  no 
means  the  least  difficult.  But  this  Limehouse  affair  is 
a  vivid  example  of  how  we  make  the  difficulty  more 
difficult.  We  are  told  again  and  again  that  the  slum- 
dwellers  of  the  big  towns  cannot  merely  be  turned 
loose  on  the  land,  that  they  do  not  want  to  go  on  the 
land,  that  they  have  no  tastes  or  turn  of  thought  that 
could  make  them  by  any  process  into  a  people  inter¬ 
ested  in  the  land,  that  they  cannot  be  conceived  as 
having  any  pleasures  except  town  pleasures,  or  even 
any  discontents  except  the  Bolshevism  of  the  towns. 
And  then,  when  a  whole  crowd  of  them  want  to  keep 
chickens,  we  force  them  to  live  in  flats.  When  a  whole 
crowd  of  them  want  to  have  fences,  we  laugh  and  or¬ 
der  them  off  into  communal  barracks.  When  a  whole 
population  wishes  to  insist  on  palings  and  enclosures 
and  the  traditions  of  private  property,  the  authori¬ 
ties  act  as  if  they  were  suppressing  a  Red  riot. 
When  these  very  hopeless  slum-dwellers  do  actually 
set  all  their  hopes  on  a  rural  occupation,  which  they 
can  still  practise  even  in  the  slums,  we  tear  them 
away  from  that  occupation  and  call  it  improving 
their  condition.  You  pick  a  man  up  who  has  his  head 
in  a  hen-coop,  forcibly  set  him  on  giant  stilts  a 
hundred  feet  high  where  he  cannot  reach  the  ground, 


138  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

and  then  say  you  have  saved  him  from  misery.  And 
you  add  that  a  man  like  that  can  only  live  on  stilts 
and  would  never  be  interested  in  hens. 

Now  the  very  first  question  that  is  always  asked 
of  those  advocating  our  sort  of  agricultural  recon¬ 
struction  is  this  question,  which  is  fundamental  be¬ 
cause  it  is  psychological.  Whatever  else  we  may  or 
may  not  need  for  a  peasantry,  we  do  certainly  need 
peasants.  In  the  present  mixture  and  muddle  of  more 
or  less  urbanized  civilization,  have  we  even  the  first 
elements  or  the  first  possibilities?  Have  we  peasants, 
or  even  potential  peasants?  Like  all  questions  of  this 
sort,  it  cannot  be  answered  by  statistics.  Statistics  are 
artificial  even  when  they  are  not  fictitious,  for  they 
always  assume  the  very  fact  which  a  moral  estimate 
must  always  deny;  they  assume  that  every  man  is  one 
man.  They  are  based  on  a  sort  of  atomic  theory  that 
the  individual  is  really  individual,  in  the  sense  of  in¬ 
divisible.  But  when  we  are  dealing  professedly  with 
the  proportion  of  different  loves  or  hates  or  hopes  or 
hungers,  this  is  so  far  from  being  a  fact  that  can  be 
assumed,  it  is  the  very  first  that  must  be  denied.  It  is 
denied  by  all  that  deeper  consideration  which  wise 
men  used  to  call  spiritual,  but  which  fools  were  fright¬ 
ened  out  of  calling  spiritual,  till  they  ventured  to  say 
it  in  Greek  and  call  it  psychical  or  psychological.  In 
one  sense  the  highest  spirituality  insists,  of  course, 
that  one  man  is  one.  But  in  the  sense  here  involved, 
the  spiritual  view  has  always  been  that  one  man  was 


VOWS  AND  VOLUNTEERS  139 

at  least  two,  and  the  psychological  view  has  shown 
some  taste  for  turning  him  into  half  a  dozen.  It  is  no 
good,  therefore,  to  discuss  the  number  of  peasants 
who  are  nothing  else  but  peasants.  Very  probably 
there  are  none  at  all.  It  is  no  good  asking  how  many 
complete  and  compact  yeomen  or  yokels  are  waiting 
all  ready  in  smock-frocks  or  blouses,  their  spades 
and  hay-forks  clutched  in  their  hand,  in  the  neigh¬ 
bourhood  of  Brompton  or  Brixton;  waiting  for  us  to 
give  the  signal  to  rush  back  to  the  land.  If  anybody 
is  such  a  fool  as  to  expect  that  sort  of  thing,  the  fool 
is  not  to  be  found  in  our  small  political  party.  When 
we  are  dealing  with  a  matter  of  this  kind,  we  are  deal¬ 
ing  with  different  elements  in  the  same  class,  or  even 
in  the  same  man.  We  are  dealing  with  elements  which 
should  be  encouraged  or  educated  or  (if  we  must 
bring  the  word  in  somewhere)  evolved.  We  have  to 
consider  whether  there  are  any  materials  out  of 
which  to  make  peasants  to  make  a  peasantry,  if  we 
really  choose  to  try.  Nowhere  in  these  notes  have  I 
suggested  that  there  is  the  faintest  possibility  of  it 
being  done,  if  we  do  not  choose  to  try. 

Now,  using  words  in  this  sensible  sense,  I  should 
maintain  that  there  is  a  very  large  element  still  in 
England  that  would  like  to  return  to  this  simpler 
sort  of  England.  Some  of  them  understand  it  better 
than  others,  some  of  them  understand  themselves 
better  than  others;  some  would  be  prepared  for  it  as 
a  revolution;  some  only  cling  to  it  very  blindly  as  a 


140 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


tradition;  some  have  never  thought  of  it  as  anything 
but  a  hobby;  some  have  never  heard  of  it  and  feel  it 
only  as  a  want.  But  the  number  of  people  who  would 
like  to  get  out  of  the  tangle  of  mere  ramifications 
and  communications  in  the  town,  and  get  back  nearer 
to  the  roots  of  things,  where  things  are  made  directly 
out  of  nature,  I  believe  to  be  very  large.  It  is  probably 
not  a  majority,  but  I  suspect  that  even  now  it  is  a 
very  large  minority.  A  man  does  not  necessarily  want 
this  more  than  everything  else  at  every  moment  of 
his  life.  No  sane  person  expects  any  movement  to  con¬ 
sist  entirely  of  such  monomaniacs.  But  a  good  many 
people  want  it  a  good  deal.  I  have  formed  that  im¬ 
pression  from  experience,  which  is  of  all  things  the 
most  difficult  to  reproduce  in  controversy.  I  guess  it 
from  the  way  in  which  numberless  suburbans  talk 
about  their  gardens.  I  guess  it  from  the  sort  of  things 
that  they  really  envy  in  the  rich;  one  of  the  most  not¬ 
able  of  which  is  merely  empty  space.  I  notice  it  in  all 
the  element  that  desires  the  country,  even  if  it  defaces 
the  country.  I  notice  it  in  the  profound  popular  in¬ 
terest  everywhere,  especially  in  England,  in  the  breed¬ 
ing  or  training  of  any  kind  of  animal.  And  if  I  wanted 
a  supreme,  a  symbolic,  a  triumphant  example  of  all 
that  I  mean,  I  could  find  it  in  the  case  I  have  quoted 
of  these  men  living  in  the  most  miserable  slums  of 
Limehouse,  and  reluctant  to  leave  them  because  it 
would  mean  leaving  behind  a  rabbit  in  a  rabbit-hutch 
or  a  chicken  in  a  hen-coop.

Now  if  we  were  really  doing  what  I  suggest,  or  if 
we  really  knew  what  we  were  doing,  we  should  seize 
on  these  slum  dwellers  as  if  they  were  infant  prod¬ 
igies  or  (even  more  lucrative)  monsters  to  be  ex¬ 
hibited  in  a  fair.  We  should  see  that  such  people  have 
a  natural  genius  for  such  things.  We  should  encourage 
them  in  such  things.  We  should  educate  them  in  such 
things.  We  should  see  in  them  the  seed  and  living 
principle  of  a  real  spontaneous  revival  of  the  country¬ 
side.  I  repeat  that  it  would  be  a  matter  of  proportion 
and  therefore  of  tact.  But  we  should  be  on  their  side, 
being  confident  that  they  are  on  our  side  and  on  the 
side  of  the  countryside.  We  should  reconstruct  our 
popular  education  so  as  to  help  these  hobbies.  We 
should  think  it  worth  while  to  teach  people  the  things 
they  are  so  eager  to  teach  themselves.  We  should 
teach  them;  we  might  even,  in  a  burst  of  Christian 
humility,  occasionally  allow  them  to  teach  us.  What 
we  do  is  to  bundle  them  out  of  their  houses,  where 
they  do  these  things  with  difficulty,  and  drag  them 
shrieking  to  new  and  unfamiliar  places  where  they 
cannot  do  them  at  all.  This  example  alone  would 
show  how  much  we  are  really  doing  for  the  rural  re¬ 
construction  of  England. 

Though  much  could  be  done  by  volunteers,  and  by 
a  voluntary  bargain  between  the  man  who  really 
could  do  the  work  and  the  man  who  frequently  can¬ 
not  get  the  rent,  there  is  nothing  in  our  social  philoso¬ 
phy  that  forbids  the  use  of  the  State  power  where  it 


142 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


can  be  used.  And  either  by  the  State  subsidy  or  some 
large  voluntary  fund,  it  seems  to  me  that  it  would 
still  be  possible  at  least  to  give  the  other  man  some¬ 
thing  as  good  as  the  rent  that  he  does  not  get.  In 
other  words,  long  before  our  Communists  come  to 
the  controversial  ethics  of  confiscation,  it  seems  to 
me  within  the  resources  of  civilization  to  enable 
Brown  to  buy  from  Smith  what  is  now  of  very  little 
value  to  Smith  and  might  be  of  very  great  value  to 
Brown.  I  know  the  current  complaint  against  subsidy, 
and  the  general  argument  that  applies  equally  to  sub¬ 
scription;  but  1  do  think  that  a  subsidy  to  restore 
agriculture  would  find  more  repayment  in  the  future 
than  a  subsidy  to  patch  up  the  position  of  coal ;  just 
as  I  think  that  in  its  turn  more  defensible  than  half  a 
hundred  salaries  that  we  pay  to  a  mob  of  nobodies 
for  plaguing  the  poor  with  sham  science  and  petty 
tyranny.  But  there  are,  as  I  have  already  hinted, 
other  ways  by  which  even  the  State  could  help  in  the 
matter.  So  long  as  we  have  State  education,  it  seems  a 
pity  that  it  can  never  at  any  moment  be  determined 
by  the  needs  of  the  State.  If  the  immediate  need  of 
the  State  is  to  pay  some  attention  to  the  existence  of 
the  earth,  there  really  seems  no  reason  why  the  eyes 
of  the  schoolmasters  and  schoolboys,  staring  at  the 
stars,  should  not  be  turned  in  the  direction  of  that 
planet.  At  present  we  have  education,  not  indeed  for 
angels,  but  rather  for  aviators.  They  do  not  even 
understand  a  man’s  wish  to  remain  tied  to  the  ground. 


VOWS  AND  VOLUNTEERS  143 

There  is  in  their  ideal  an  insanity  that  may  be  truly 
called  unearthly. 

Now  I  suggest  such  a  peasantry  of  volunteers  pri¬ 
marily  as  a  nucleus,  but  I  think  it  will  be  a  nucleus 
of  attraction.  I  think  it  will  stand  up  not  only  as  a 
rock  but  as  a  magnet.  In  other  words,  as  soon  as  it  is 
admitted  that  it  can  be  done,  it  will  become  im¬ 
portant  when  a  nuuber  of  other  things  can  no  longer 
be  done.  When  trade  is  increasingly  bad,  this  will  be 
counted  better  even  by  those  who  count  it  a  second 
best.  When  we  speak  of  people  leaving  the  country¬ 
side  and  flocking  to  the  towns,  we  are  not  judging  the 
case  fairly.  Something  may  be  allowed  for  a  social 
type  that  would  always  prefer  cinemas  and  picture 
post  cards  even  to  property  and  liberty.  But  there  is 
nothing  conclusive  in  the  fact  that  people  prefer  to  go 
without  property  and  liberty,  with  a  cinema,  to  go¬ 
ing  without  property  and  liberty  without  a  cinema. 
Some  people  may  like  the  town  so  much  that  they 
would  rather  be  sweated  in  the  town  than  free  in  the 
country.  But  nothing  is  proved  by  the  mere  fact  that 
they  would  rather  be  sweated  in  the  town  than 
sweated  in  the  country.  I  believe,  therefore,  that  if  we 
created  even  a  considerable  patch  of  peasantry,  the 
patch  would  grow.  People  would  fall  back  on  it  as 
they  retired  from  the  declining  trades.  At  present  the 
patch  is  not  growing,  because  there  is  no  patch  to 
grow;  people  do  not  even  believe  in  its  existence,  and 
can  hardly  believe  in  its  extension. 


144  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

So  far,  I  merely  propose  to  suggest  that  many  peas¬ 
ants  would  now  be  ready  to  work  alone  on  the  land, 
though  it  would  be  a  sacrifice;  that  many  squires 
would  be  ready  to  let  them  have  the  land,  though  it 
would  be  a  sacrifice;  that  the  State  (and  for  that  mat¬ 
ter  any  other  patriotic  corporation)  could  be  called 
upon  to  help  either  or  both  in  these  actions,  that  it 
might  not  be  an  intolerable  or  impossible  sacrifice. 
In  all  this  I  would  remind  the  reader  that  I  am  only 
dealing  with  immediately  practicable  action  and  not 
with  an  ultimate  or  complete  condition;  but  it  seems 
to  me  that  something  of  this  sort  might  be  set  about 
almost  at  once.  I  shall  next  proceed  to  consider  a 
misunderstanding  about  how  a  group  of  peasants 
could  live  on  the  land. 


Ill 


THE  REAL  LIFE  ON  THE  LAND 

We  offer  one  among  many  proposals  for  undoing 
the  evil  of  capitalism,  on  the  ground  that  ours  is  the 
only  one  that  really  is  a  proposal  for  undoing  it.  The 
others  are  all  proposals  for  overdoing  it.  The  natural 
thing  to  do  with  a  wrong  operation  is  to  reverse  it. 
The  natural  action,  when  property  has  fallen  into 
fewer  hands,  is  to  restore  it  to  more  numerous  hands. 
If  twenty  men  are  fishing  in  a  river  in  such  a  crowd 
that  their  fishing-lines  all  get  entangled  into  one,  the 
normal  operation  is  to  disentangle  them,  and  sort 
them  out  so  that  each  fisherman  has  his  own  fishing- 
line.  No  doubt  a  collectivist  philosopher  standing  on 
the  bank  might  point  out  that  the  interwoven  lines 
were  now  practically  a  net;  and  might  be  trailed 
along  by  a  common  effort  so  as  to  drag  the  river-bed. 
But  apart  from  his  scheme  being  doubtful  in  practice, 
it  insults  the  intellectual  instincts  even  in  principle. 
It  is  not  putting  things  right  to  take  a  doubtful  ad¬ 
vantage  of  their  being  wrong;  and  it  does  not  even 
sound  like  a  sane  design  to  exaggerate  an  accident. 
Socialism  is  but  the  completion  of  the  capitalist  con¬ 
centration;  yet  that  concentration  was  itself  effected 
blindly  like  a  blunder.  Now  this  naturalness  in  the 

145 


146  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

idea  of  undoing  what  was  ill  done  would  appeal,  I 
think,  to  many  natural  people  who  feel  the  long- 
winded  sociological  schemes  to  be  quite  unnatural. 
For  that  reason  I  suggest  in  this  section  that  many 
ordinary  men,  landlords  and  labourers,  Tories  and 
Radicals,  would  probably  help  us  in  this  task,  if  it 
were  separated  from  party  politics  and  from  the  pride 
and  pedantry  of  the  intellectuals. 

But  there  is  another  aspect  in  which  the  task  is 
both  more  easy  and  more  difficult.  It  is  more  easy  be¬ 
cause  it  need  not  be  crushed  by  complexities  of  cos¬ 
mopolitan  trade.  It  is  harder  because  it  is  a  hard  life 
to  live  apart  from  them.  A  Distributist  for  whose 
work  (on  a  little  paper  defaced,  alas,  with  my  own  in¬ 
itials)  I  have  a  very  lively  gratitude,  once  noted  a 
truth  often  neglected.  He  said  that  living  on  the  land 
was  quite  a  different  thing  from  living  by  carting 
things  off  it.  He  proved,  far  more  lucidly  than  I  could, 
how  practical  is  the  difference  in  economics.  But  I 
should  like  to  add  here  a  word  about  a  correspond¬ 
ing  distinction  in  ethics.  For  the  former,  it  is  obvious 
that  most  arguments  about  the  inevitable  failure  of 
a  man  growing  turnips  in  Sussex  are  arguments  about 
his  failing  to  sell  them,  not  about  his  failing  to  eat 
them.  Now  as  I  have  already  explained,  I  do  not  pro¬ 
pose  to  reduce  all  citizens  to  one  type,  and  certainly 
not  to  one  turnip-eater.  In  a  greater  or  less  degree,  as 
circumstances  dictated,  there  would  doubtless  be  peo¬ 
ple  selling  turnips  to  other  people;  perhaps  even  the 


THE  REAL  LIFE  ON  THE  LAND  147 

most  ardent  turnip-eater  would  probably  sell  some 
turnips  to  some  people.  But  my  meaning  will  not  be 
clear  if  it  be  supposed  that  no  more  social  simplifica¬ 
tion  is  needed  than  is  implied  in  selling  turnips  out  of 
a  field  instead  of  top-hats  out  of  a  shop.  It  seems  to 
me  that  a  great  many  people  would  be  only  too  glad 
to  live  on  the  land,  when  they  find  the  only  alterna¬ 
tive  is  to  starve  in  the  street.  And  it  would  surely 
modify  the  modern  enormity  of  unemployment,  if  any 
large  number  of  people  were  really  living  on  the  land, 
not  merely  in  the  sense  of  sleeping  on  the  land  but  of 
feeding  on  the  land.  There  will  be  many  who  main¬ 
tain  that  this  would  mean  a  very  dull  life  compared 
with  the  excitements  of  dying  in  a  workhouse  in  Liv¬ 
erpool;  just  as  there  are  many  who  insist  that  the 
average  woman  is  made  to  drudge  in  the  home,  with¬ 
out  asking  whether  the  average  man  exults  in  having 
to  drudge  in  the  office.  But  passing  over  the  fact  that 
we  may  soon  be  faced  with  a  problem  at  least  as  pro¬ 
saic  as  a  famine,  I  do  not  admit  that  such  a  life  is 
necessarily  or  entirely  prosaic.  Rustic  populations, 
largely  self-supporting,  seem  to  have  amused  them¬ 
selves  with  a  great  many  mythologies  and  dances  and 
decorative  arts;  and  I  am  not  convinced  that  the 
turnip-eater  always  has  a  head  like  a  turnip  or  that 
the  top-hat  always  covers  the  brain  of  a  philosopher. 
But  if  we  look  at  the  problem  from  the  point  of  view 
of  the  community  as  a  whole,  we  shall  note  other 
and  not  uninteresting  things.  A  system  based  entirely 


148  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

on  the  division  of  labour  is  in  one  sense  literally  half¬ 
witted.  That  is,  each  performer  of  half  of  an  operation 
does  really  use  only  half  of  his  wits.  It  is  not  a  ques¬ 
tion  in  the  ordinary  sense  of  intellect,  and  certainly 
not  in  the  sense  of  intellectualism.  But  it  is  a  question 
of  integrity,  in  the  strict  sense  of  the  word.  The  peas¬ 
ant  does  live,  not  merely  a  simple  life,  but  a  complete 
life.  It  may  be  very  simple  in  its  completeness,  but  the 
community  is  not  complete  without  that  complete¬ 
ness.  The  community  is  at  present  very  defective  be¬ 
cause  there  is  not  in  the  core  of  it  any  such  simple 
consciousness;  any  one  man  who  represents  the  two 
parties  to  a  contract.  Unless  there  is,  there  is  no¬ 
where  a  full  understanding  of  those  terms:  self- 
support,  self-control,  self-government.  He  is  the  only 
unanimous  mob  and  the  only  universal  man.  He  is 
the  one  half  of  the  world  which  does  know  how  the 
other  half  lives. 

Many  must  have  quoted  the  stately  tag  from  Virgil 
which  says,  “Happy  were  he  who  could  know  the 
causes  of  things,”  without  remembering  in  what  con¬ 
text  it  comes.  Many  have  probably  quoted  it  because 
the  others  have  quoted  it.  Many,  if  left  in  ignorance 
to  guess  whence  it  comes,  would  probably  guess 
wrong.  Everybody  knows  that  Virgil,  like  Homer, 
ventured  to  describe  boldly  enough  the  most  secret 
councils  of  the  gods.  Everybody  knows  that  Virgil, 
like  Dante,  took  his  hero  into  Tartarus  and  the  laby¬ 
rinth  of  the  last  and  lowest  foundations  of  the  uni- 


THE  REAL  LIFE  ON  THE  LAND  149 

verse.  Every  one  knows  that  he  dealt  with  the  fall  of 
Troy  and  the  rise  of  Rome,  with  the  laws  of  an  em¬ 
pire  fitted  to  rule  all  the  children  of  men,  with  the 
ideals  that  should  stand  like  stars  before  men  com¬ 
mitted  to  that  awful  stewardship.  Yet  it  is  in  none  of 
these  connections,  in  none  of  these  passages,  that  he 
makes  the  curious  remark  about  human  happiness 
consisting  in  a  knowledge  of  causes.  He  says  it,  I 
fancy,  in  a  pleasantly  didactic  poem  about  the  rules 
for  keeping  bees.  Anyhow,  it  is  part  of  a  series  of  ele¬ 
gant  essays  on  country  pursuits,  in  one  sense,  indeed, 
trivial,  but  in  another  sense  almost  technical.  It  is  in 
the  midst  of  these  quiet  and  yet  busy  things  that  the 
great  poet  suddenly  breaks  out  into  the  great  pas¬ 
sage,  about  the  happy  man  whom  neither  kings  nor 
mobs  can  cow;  who,  having  beheld  the  root  and  rea¬ 
son  of  all  things,  can  even  hear  under  his  feet,  un¬ 
shaken,  the  roar  of  the  river  of  hell. 

And  in  saying  this,  the  poet  certainly  proves  once 
more  the  two  great  truths:  that  a  poet  is  a  prophet, 
and  that  a  prophet  is  a  practical  man.  Just  as  his 
longing  for  a  deliverer  of  the  nations  was  an  uncon¬ 
scious  prophecy  of  Christ,  so  his  criticism  of  town 
and  country  is  an  unconscious  prophecy  of  the  decay 
that  has  come  on  the  world  through  falling  away 
from  Christianity.  Much  may  be  said  about  the  mon¬ 
strosity  of  modern  cities;  it  is  easy  to  see  and  perhaps 
a  little  too  easy  to  say.  I  have  every  sympathy  with 
some  wild-haired  prophet  who  should  lift  up  his  voice 


150 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


in  the  streets  to  proclaim  the  Burden  of  Brompton  in 
the  manner  of  the  Burden  of  Babylon.  I  will  support 
(to  the  extent  of  sixpence,  as  Carlyle  said)  any  old 
man  with  a  beard  who  will  wave  his  arms  and  call 
down  fire  from  heaven  upon  Bayswater.  I  quite  agree 
that  lions  will  howl  in  the  high  places  of  Paddington; 
and  I  am  entirely  in  favour  of  jackals  and  vultures 
rearing  their  young  in  the  ruins  of  the  Albert  Hall. 
But  in  these  cases,  perhaps,  the  prophet  is  less  ex¬ 
plicit  than  the  poet.  He  does  not  tell  us  exactly  what 
is  wrong  with  the  town;  but  merely  leaves  it  to  our 
own  delicate  intuitions,  to  infer  from  the  sudden  ap¬ 
pearance  of  wild  unicorns  trampling  down  our  gar¬ 
dens,  or  a  shower  of  flaming  serpents  shooting  over 
our  heads  through  the  sky  like  a  flight  of  arrows,  or 
some  such  significant  detail,  that  there  probably  is 
something  wrong.  But  if  we  wish  in  another  mood  to 
know  intellectually  what  it  is  that  is  wrong  with  the 
city,  and  why  it  seems  to  be  driving  on  to  dooms  quite 
as  unnatural  and  much  more  ugly,  we  shall  certainly 
find  it  in  that  profound  and  piercing  irrelevancy  of 
the  Latin  line. 

What  is  wrong  with  the  man  in  the  modern  town 
is  that  he  does  not  know  the  causes  of  things;  and 
that  is  why,  as  the  poet  says,  he  can  be  too  much  dom¬ 
inated  by  despots  and  demagogues.  He  does  not  know 
where  things  come  from;  he  is  the  type  of  the  culti¬ 
vated  Cockney  who  said  he  liked  milk  out  of  a  clean 
shop  and  not  a  dirty  cow.  The  more  elaborate  is  the 


THE  REAL  LIFE  ON  THE  LAND  151 

town  organization,  the  more  elaborate  even  is  the 
town  education,  the  less  is  he  the  happy  man  of  Vir¬ 
gil  who  knows  the  causes  of  things.  The  town  civili¬ 
zation  simply  means  the  number  of  shops  through 
which  the  milk  does  pass  from  the  cow  to  the  man; 
in  other  words,  it  means  the  number  of  opportunities 
of  wasting  the  milk,  of  watering  the  milk,  of  poison¬ 
ing  the  milk,  and  of  swindling  the  man.  If  ever  he 
protests  against  being  poisoned  or  swindled,  he  will 
certainly  be  told  that  it  is  no  good  crying  over  spilt 
milk;  or,  in  other  words,  that  it  is  reactionary  senti¬ 
mentalism  to  attempt  to  undo  what  is  done  or  to  re¬ 
store  what  is  perished.  But  he  does  not  protest  very 
much,  because  he  cannot;  and  he  cannot  because  he 
does  not  know  enough  about  the  causes  of  things— 
about  the  primary  forms  of  property  and  production, 

or  the  points  where  man  is  nearest  to  his  natural  ori¬ 
gins. 

So  far  the  fundamental  fact  is  clear  enough;  and 
by  this  time  this  side  of  the  truth  is  even  fairly  fa¬ 
miliar.  A  few  people  are  still  ignorant  enough  to  talk 
about  the  ignorant  peasant.  But  obviously  in  the  es¬ 
sential  sense  it  would  be  far  truer  to  talk  about  the 
ignorant  townsman.  Even  where  the  townsman  is 
equally  well  employed,  he  is  not  in  this  sense  equally 
well  informed.  Indeed,  we  should  see  this  simple  fact 
clearly  enough,  if  it  concerned  almost  anything  except 
the  essentials  of  our  life.  If  a  geologist  were  tapping 
with  a  geological  hammer  on  the  bricks  of  a  half- 


152  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

built  house,  and  telling  the  bricklayers  what  the  clay 
was  and  where  it  came  from,  we  might  think  him  a 
nuisance;  but  we  should  probably  think  him  a  learned 
nuisance.  We  might  prefer  the  workman’s  hammer  to 
the  geologist’s  hammer;  but  we  should  admit  that 
there  were  some  things  in  the  geologist’s  head  that  did 
not  happen  to  be  in  the  workman’s  head.  Yet  the 
yokel,  or  young  man  from  the  country,  really  would 
know  something  about  the  origin  of  our  breakfasts, 
as  does  the  professor  about  the  origin  of  our  bricks. 
Should  we  see  a  grotesque  medieval  monster  called 
a  pig  hung  topsy-turvy  from  a  butcher’s  hook,  like 
a  huge  bat  from  a  branch,  it  will  be  the  young  man 
from  the  country  who  will  soothe  our  fears  and  still 
our  refined  shrieks  with  some  account  of  the  harm¬ 
less  habits  of  this  fabulous  animal,  and  by  tracing 
the  strange  and  secret  connection  between  it  and  the 
rashers  on  the  breakfast  table.  If  a  thunderbolt  or 
meteoric  stone  fell  in  front  of  us  in  the  street,  we 
might  have  more  sympathy  with  the  policeman  who 
wanted  to  remove  it  from  the  thoroughfare  than  with 
the  professor  who  wished  to  stand  in  the  middle  of 
the  thoroughfare,  lecturing  on  the  constituent  ele¬ 
ments  of  the  comet  or  nebula  of  which  it  was  a  flying 
fragment.  But  though  the  policeman  might  be  justi¬ 
fied  in  exclaiming  (in  the  original  Greek)  “What  are 
the  Pleiades  to  me?”  even  he  would  admit  that  more 
information  about  the  soil  and  strata  of  the  Pleiades 
can  be  obtained  from  a  professor  than  from  a  police- 


THE  REAL  LIFE  ON  THE  LAND  153 

man.  So  if  some  strange  and  swollen  monstrosity 
called  a  vegetable  marrow  surprises  us  like  a  thun¬ 
derbolt,  let  us  not  imagine  that  it  is  so  strange  to  the 
man  who  grows  marrows  as  it  is  to  us,  merely  because 
his  field  and  work  seem  to  be  as  far  away  as  the 
Pleiades.  Let  us  recognize  that  he  is,  after  all,  a  spe¬ 
cialist  on  these  mysterious  marrows  and  prehistoric 
pigs;  and  treat  him  like  a  learned  man  come  from  a 
foreign  university.  England  is  now  such  a  long  way 
off  from  London  that  its  emissaries  might  at  least  be 
received  with  the  respect  due  to  distinguished  visitors 
from  China  or  the  Cannibal  Islands.  But,  anyhow,  we 
need  no  longer  talk  of  them  as  merely  ignorant,  in 
talking  of  the  very  thing  of  which  we  are  ignorant 
ourselves.  One  man  may  think  the  peasant’s  knowl¬ 
edge  irrelevant,  as  another  may  think  the  professor’s 
irrelevant;  but  in  both  cases  it  is  knowledge;  for  it  is 
knowledge  of  the  causes  of  things. 

Most  of  us  realize  in  some  sense  that  this  is  true; 
but  many  of  us  have  not  yet  realized  that  the  converse 
is  also  true.  And  it  is  that  other  truth,  when  we  have 
understood  it,  that  leads  to  the  next  necessary  point 
about  the  full  status  of  the  peasant.  And  the  point  is 
this:  that  the  peasant  also  will  have  but  a  partial  ex¬ 
perience  if  he  grows  things  in  the  country  solely  in 
order  to  sell  them  to  the  town.  Of  course,  it  is  only  a 
joke  to  represent  either  the  ignorance  of  town  or  coun¬ 
try  as  being  so  grotesque  as  I  have  suggested  for  the 
sake  of  example.  The  townsman  does  not  really  think 


154  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

that  milk  is  rained  from  the  clouds  or  that  rashers 
grow  on  trees,  even  when  he  is  a  little  vague  about 
vegetable  marrows.  He  knows  something  about  it; 
but  not  enough  to  make  his  advice  of  much  value. 
The  rustic  does  not  really  think  that  milk  is  used  as 
whitewash  or  marrows  as  bolsters,  even  if  he  never  ac¬ 
tually  sees  them  used.  But  if  he  is  a  mere  producer 
and  not  a  consumer  of  them,  his  position  does  become 
as  partial  as  that  of  any  Cockney  clerk;  nearly  as 
narrow  and  even  more  servile.  Given  the  wonderful 
romance  of  the  vegetable  marrow,  it  is  a  bad  thing 
that  the  peasant  should  only  know  the  beginning  of 
the  story,  as  it  is  a  bad  thing  that  the  clerk  should 
only  know  the  end  of  it. 

I  insert  here  this  general  suggestion  for  a  particular 
reason.  Before  we  come  to  the  practical  expediency  of 
the  peasant  who  consumes  what  he  produces  (and  the 
reason  for  thinking  it,  as  Mr.  Heseltine  has  urged, 
much  more  practicable  than  the  method  by  which  he 
only  sells  what  he  produces),  I  think  it  well  to  point 
out  that  this  course,  while  it  is  more  expedient,  is  not 
a  mere  surrender  to  expediency.  It  seems  to  me  a  very 
good  thing,  in  theory  as  well  as  practice,  that  there 
should  be  a  body  of  citizens  primarily  concerned  in 
producing  and  consuming  and  not  in  exchanging.  It 
seems  to  me  a  part  of  our  ideal,  and  not  merely  a  part 
of  our  compromise,  that  there  should  be  in  the  com¬ 
munity  a  sort  of  core  not  only  of  simplicity  but  of 
completeness.  Exchange  and  variation  can  then  be 


THE  REAL  LIFE  ON  THE  ISLAND  155 

given  their  reasonable  place;  as  they  were  in  the  old 
world  of  fairs  and  markets.  But  there  would  be  some¬ 
where  in  the  centre  of  civilization  a  type  that  was 
truly  independent;  in  the  sense  of  producing  and  con¬ 
suming  within  its  own  social  circle.  I  do  not  say  that 
such  a  complete  human  life  stands  for  a  complete  hu¬ 
manity.  I  do  not  say  that  the  State  needs  only  the 
man  who  needs  nothing  from  the  State.  But  I  do  say 
that  this  man  who  supplies  his  own  needs  is  very 
much  needed.  I  say  it  largely  because  of  his  absence 
from  modern  civilization,  that  modern  civilization 
has  lost  unity.  It  is  nobody’s  business  to  note  the 
whole  of  a  process,  to  see  where  things  come  from  and 
where  they  go  to.  Nobody  follows  the  whole  winding 
course  of  the  river  of  milk  as  it  flows  from  the  cow  to 
the  baby.  Nobody  who  is  in  at  the  death  of  the  pig 
is  responsible  for  realizing  that  the  proof  of  the  pig 
is  in  the  eating.  Men  throw  marrows  at  other  men 
like  cannon  balls;  but  they  do  not  return  to  them  like 
boomerangs.  We  need  a  social  circle  in  which  things 
constantly  return  to  those  that  threw  them;  and  men 
who  know  the  end  and  the  beginning  and  the  round¬ 
ing  of  our  little  life.

THE  WHEEL  OF  FATE 

The  evil  we  are  seeking  to  destroy  clings  about  in 
corners,  especially  in  the  form  of  catch-phrases  by 
which  even  the  intelligent  can  easily  be  caught.  One 
phrase,  which  we  may  hear  from  anybody  at  any  mo¬ 
ment,  is  the  phrase  that  such  and  such  a  modern  in¬ 
stitution  has  “come  to  stay.”  It  is  these  half-meta¬ 
phors  that  tend  to  make  us  all  half-witted.  What  is 
precisely  meant  by  the  statement  that  the  steam- 
engine  or  the  wireless  apparatus  has  come  to  stay? 
What  is  meant,  for  that  matter,  even  by  saying  that 
the  Eiffel  Tower  has  come  to  stay?  To  begin  with,  we 
obviously  do  not  mean  what  we  mean  when  we  use  the 
words  naturally;  as  in  the  expression,  “Uncle  Hum¬ 
phrey  has  come  to  stay.”  That  last  sentence  may  be 
uttered  in  tones  of  joy,  or  of  resignation,  or  even  of 
despair;  but  not  of  despair  in  the  sense  that  Uncle 
Humphrey  is  really  a  monument  that  can  never  be 
moved.  Uncle  Humphrey  did  come;  and  Uncle  Hum¬ 
phrey  will  presumably  at  some  time  go;  it  is  even 
possible  (however  painful  it  may  be  to  imagine  such 
domestic  relations)  that  in  the  last  resort  he  should 
be  made  to  go.  The  fact  that  the  figure  breaks  down, 
even  apart  from  the  reality  it  is  supposed  to  repre- 

159 


160  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

sent,  illustrates  how  loosely  these  catch-words  are 
used.  But  when  we  say,  “The  Eiffel  Tower  has  come 
to  stay,”  we  are  still  more  inaccurate.  For,  to  begin 
with,  the  Eiffel  Tower  has  not  come  at  all.  There 
was  never  a  moment  when  the  Eiffel  Tower  was  seen 
striding  towards  Paris  on  its  long  iron  legs  across  the 
plains  of  France,  as  the  giant  in  the  glorious  night¬ 
mare  of  Rabelais  came  to  tower  over  Paris  and  carry 
away  the  bells  of  Notre-Dame.  The  figure  of  Uncle 
Humphrey  seen  coming  up  the  road  may  possibly 
strike  as  much  terror  as  any  walking  tower  or  tower¬ 
ing  giant;  and  the  question  that  may  leap  into  every 
mind  may  be  the  question  of  whether  he  has  come  to 
stay.  But  whether  or  no  he  has  come  to  stay  he  has 
certainly  come.  He  has  willed;  he  has  propelled  or 
precipitated  his  body  in  a  certain  direction;  he  has 
agitated  his  own  legs;  it  is  even  possible  (for  we  all 
know  what  Uncle  Humphrey  is  like)  that  he  has  in¬ 
sisted  on  carrying  his  own  portmanteau,  to  show  the 
lazy  young  dogs  what  he  can  still  do  at  seventy-three. 

Now  suppose  that  what  had  really  happened  was 
something  like  this;  something  like  a  weird  story  of 
Hawthorne  or  Poe.  Suppose  we  ourselves  had  actually 
manufactured  Uncle  Humphrey;  had  put  him  to¬ 
gether,  piece  by  piece,  like  a  mechanical  doll.  Suppose 
we  had  so  ardently  felt  at  the  moment  the  need  of  an 
uncle  in  our  home  life  that  we  had  constructed  him 
out  of  domestic  materials,  like  a  Guy  for  the  fifth  of 
November.  Taking,  it  may  be,  a  turnip  from  the 


THE  WHEEL  OF  FATE  161 

kitchen-garden  to  represent  his  bald  and  venerable 
head;  permitting  the  water-butt,  as  it  were,  to  sug¬ 
gest  the  lines  of  his  figure;  stuffing  a  pair  of  trousers 
and  attaching  a  pair  of  boots,  we  could  produce  a 
complete  and  convincing  uncle  of  whom  any  family 
might  be  proud.  Under  those  conditions,  it  might  be 
graceful  enough  to  say,  in  the  merely  social  sense  and 
as  a  sort  of  polite  fiction,  “Uncle  Humphrey  has  come 
to  stay.”  But  surely  it  would  be  very  extraordinary  if 
we  afterwards  found  the  dummy  relative  was  nothing 
but  a  nuisance,  or  that  his  materials  were  needed  for 
other  purposes — surely  it  would  be  very  extraordi¬ 
nary  if  we  were  then  forbidden  to  take  him  to  pieces 
again;  if  every  effort  in  that  direction  were  met  with 
the  resolute  answer,  “No,  no;  Uncle  Humphrey  has 
come  to  stay.”  Surely  we  should  be  tempted  to  retort 
that  Uncle  Humphrey  never  came  at  all.  Suppose  all 
the  turnips  were  wanted  for  the  self-support  of  the 
peasant  home.  Suppose  the  water-butts  were  wanted; 
let  us  hope  for  the  purpose  of  holding  beer.  Suppose 
the  male  members  of  the  family  refused  any  longer  to 
lend  their  trousers  to  an  entirely  imaginary  relative. 
Surely  we  should  then  see  through  the  polite  fiction 
that  led  us  to  talk  as  if  the  uncle  had  “come,”  had 
come  with  an  intention,  had  remained  with  a  purpose, 
and  all  the  rest.  The  thing  we  made  did  not  come,  and 
certainly  did  not  come  to  do  anything,  either  to  stay 
or  to  depart. 

Now  no  doubt  most  people  even  in  the  logical  city 


162  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

of  Paris  would  say  that  the  Eiffel  Tower  has  come  to 
stay.  And  no  doubt  most  people  in  the  same  city 
rather  more  than  a  hundred  years  before  would  have 
said  that  the  Bastille  had  come  to  stay.  But  it  did  not 
stay;  it  left  the  neighbourhood  quite  abruptly.  In 
plain  words,  the  Bastille  was  something  that  man  had 
made  and,  therefore,  man  could  unmake.  The  Eiffel 
Tower  is  something  that  man  has  made  and  man 
could  unmake;  though  perhaps  we  may  think  it  prac¬ 
tically  probable  that  some  time  will  elapse  before  man 
will  have  the  good  taste  or  good  sense  or  even  the 
common  sanity  to  unmake  it.  But  this  one  little 
phrase  about  the  thing  “coming”  is  alone  enough  to 
indicate  something  profoundly  wrong  about  the  very 
working  of  men’s  minds  on  the  subject.  Obviously  a 
man  ought  to  be  saying,  “I  have  made  an  electric 
battery.  Shall  I  smash  it,  or  shall  I  make  another?” 
Instead  of  that,  he  seems  to  be  bewitched  by  a  sort  of 
magic  and  stand  staring  at  the  thing  as  if  it  were  a 
seven-headed  dragon;  and  he  can  only  say,  “The  elec¬ 
tric  battery  has  come.  Has  it  come  to  stay?” 

Before  we  begin  any  talk  of  the  practical  problem 
of  machinery,  it  is  necessary  to  leave  off  thinking  like 
machines.  It  is  necessary  to  begin  at  the  beginning 
and  consider  the  end.  Now  we  do  not  necessarily  wish 
to  destroy  every  sort  of  machinery.  But  we  do  desire 
to  destroy  a  certain  sort  of  mentality.  And  that  is  pre¬ 
cisely  the  sort  of  mentality  that  begins  by  telling  us 
that  nobody  can  destroy  machinery.  Those  who  begin 


THE  WHEEL  OF  FATE  163 

by  saying  that  we  cannot  abolish  the  machine,  that 
we  must  use  the  machine,  are  themselves  refusing  to 
use  the  mind. 

The  aim  of  human  polity  is  human  happiness.  For 
those  holding  certain  beliefs  it  is  conditioned  by  the 
hope  of  a  larger  happiness,  which  it  must  not  imperil. 
But  happiness,  the  making  glad  of  the  heart  of  man, 
is  the  secular  test  and  the  only  realistic  test.  So  far 
from  this  test,  by  the  talisman  of  the  heart,  being 
merely  sentimental,  it  is  the  only  test  that  is  in  the 
least  practical.  There  is  no  law  of  logic  or  nature  or 
anything  else  forcing  us  to  prefer  anything  else. 
There  is  no  obligation  on  us  to  be  richer,  or  busier, 
or  more  efficient,  or  more  productive,  or  more  pro¬ 
gressive,  or  in  any  way  worldlier  or  wealthier,  if  it 
does  not  make  us  happier.  Mankind  has  as  much  right 
to  scrap  its  machinery  and  live  on  the  land,  if  it  really 
likes  it  better,  as  any  man  has  to  sell  his  old  bicycle 
and  go  for  a  walk,  if  he  likes  that  better.  It  is  obvious 
that  the  walk  will  be  slower;  but  he  has  no  duty  to  be 
fast.  And  if  it  can  be  shown  that  machinery  has  come 
into  the  world  as  a  curse,  there  is  no  reason  whatever 
for  our  respecting  it  because  it  is  a  marvellous  and 
practical  and  productive  curse.  There  is  no  reason 
why  we  should  not  leave  all  its  powers  unused,  if  we 
have  really  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  powers  do 
us  harm.  The  mere  fact  that  we  shall  be  missing  a 
number  of  interesting  things  would  apply  equally  to 
any  number  of  impossible  things.  Machinery  may  be 


164  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

a  magnificent  sight,  but  not  so  magnificent  as  a  Great 
Fire  of  London;  yet  we  resist  that  vision  and  avert 
our  eyes  from  all  that  potential  splendour.  Machinery 
may  not  yet  be  at  its  best;  and  perhaps  lions  and 
tigers  will  never  be  at  their  best,  will  never  make  their 
most  graceful  leaps  or  show  all  their  natural  splen¬ 
dours,  until  we  erect  an  amphitheatre  and  give  them 
a  few  live  people  to  eat.  Yet  that  sight  also  is  one 
which  we  forbid  ourselves,  with  whatever  austere  self- 
denial.  We  give  up  so  many  glorious  possibilities,  in 
our  stern  and  strenuous  and  self-sacrificing  preference 
for  having  a  tolerable  time.  Happiness,  in  a  sense,  is 
a  hard  taskmaster.  It  tells  us  not  to  get  entangled 
with  many  things  that  are  much  more  superficially 
attractive  than  machinery.  But,  anyhow,  it  is  neces¬ 
sary  to  clear  our  minds  at  the  start  of  any  mere  vague 
association  or  assumption  to  the  effect  that  we  must 
go  by  the  quickest  train  or  cannot  help  using  the  most 
productive  instrument.  Granted  Mr.  Penty’s  thesis  of 
the  evil  of  machinery,  as  something  like  the  evil  of 
black  magic,  and  there  is  nothing  in  the  least  unprac¬ 
tical  about  Mr.  Penty’s  proposal  that  it  should  simply 
stop.  A  process  of  invention  would  cease  that  might 
have  gone  further.  But  its  relative  imperfection  would 
be  nothing  compared  with  the  rudimentary  state  in 
which  we  have  left  such  scientific  instruments  as  the 
rack  and  the  thumbscrew.  Those  rude  implements  of 
torture  are  clumsy  compared  with  the  finished  prod- 


165 


THE  WHEEL  OF  FATE 

ucts  that  modern  knowledge  of  physiology  and  me¬ 
chanics  might  have  given  us.  Many  a  talented  tor¬ 
turer  is  left  in  obscurity  by  the  moral  prejudices  of 
modern  society.  Nay,  his  budding  promise  is  now 
nipped  even  in  childhood,  when  he  attempts  to  de¬ 
velop  his  natural  genius  on  the  flies  or  the  tail  of  the 
dog.  Our  own  strong  sentimental  bias  against  torture 
represses  his  noble  rage  and  freezes  the  genial  cur¬ 
rent  of  his  soul.  But  we  reconcile  ourselves  to  this; 
though  it  be  undoubtedly  the  loss  of  a  whole  science 
for  which  many  ingenious  persons  might  have  sought 
out  many  inventions.  If  we  really  conclude  that  ma¬ 
chinery  is  hostile  to  happiness,  then  it  is  no  more  in¬ 
evitable  that  all  ploughing  should  be  done  by  ma¬ 
chinery  than  it  is  inevitable  that  a  shop  should  do  a 
roaring  trade  on  Ludgate  Hill  by  selling  the  instru¬ 
ments  of  Chinese  tortures. 

Let  it  be  clearly  understood  that  I  note  this  only 
to  make  the  primary  problem  clear;  I  am  not  now 
saying,  nor  perhaps  should  I  ever  say,  that  machinery 
has  been  proved  to  be  practically  poisonous  in  this 
degree.  I  am  only  stating,  in  answer  to  a  hundred 
confused  assumptions,  the  only  ultimate  aim  and 
test.  If  we  can  make  men  happier,  it  does  not  matter 
if  we  make  them  poorer,  it  does  not  matter  if  we  make 
them  less  productive,  it  does  not  matter  if  we  make 
them  less  progressive,  in  the  sense  of  merely  changing 
their  life  without  increasing  their  liking  for  it.  We  of 


166  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

this  school  of  thought  may  or  may  not  get  what  we 
want;  but  it  is  at  least  necessary  that  we  should  know 
what  we  are  trying  to  get.  And  those  who  are  called 
practical  men  never  know  what  they  are  trying  to  get. 
If  machinery  does  prevent  happiness,  then  it  is  as 
futile  to  tell  a  man  trying  to  make  men  happy  that  he 
is  neglecting  the  talents  of  Arkwright,  as  to  tell  a  man 
trying  to  make  men  humane  that  he  is  neglecting  the 
tastes  of  Nero. 

Now  it  is  exactly  those  who  have  the  clarity  to 
imagine  the  instant  annihilation  of  machines  who  will 
probably  have  too  much  common  sense  to  annihilate 
them  instantly.  To  go  mad  and  smash  machinery  is 
a  more  or  less  healthy  and  human  malady,  as  it  was  in 
the  Luddites.  But  it  was  really  owing  to  the  ignorance 
of  the  Luddites,  in  a  very  different  sense  from  that 
spoken  of  scornfully  by  the  stupendous  ignorance  of 
the  Industrial  Economists.  It  was  blind  revolt  as 
against  some  ancient  and  awful  dragon,  by  men  too 
ignorant  to  know  how  artificial  and  even  temporary 
was  that  particular  instrument,  or  where  was  the  seat 
of  the  real  tyrants  who  wielded  it.  The  real  answer  to 
the  mechanical  problem  for  the  present  is  of  a  differ¬ 
ent  sort;  and  I  will  proceed  to  suggest  it,  having  once 
made  clear  the  only  methods  of  judgment  by  which 
it  can  be  judged.  And  having  begun  at  the  right  end, 
which  is  the  ultimate  spiritual  standard  by  which  a 
man  or  a  machine  is  to  be  valued,  I  will  now  begin  at 
the  other  end;  I  might  say  at  the  wrong  end;  but  it 


THE  WHEEL  OF  FATE  167 

will  be  more  respectful  to  our  practical  friends  to  call 
it  the  business  end. 

If  I  am  asked  what  I  should  immediately  do  with 
a  machine,  I  have  no  doubt  about  the  sort  of  prac¬ 
tical  programme  that  could  be  a  preliminary  to  a 
possible  spiritual  revolution  of  a  much  wider  sort.  In 
so  far  as  the  machine  cannot  be  shared,  I  would  have 
the  ownership  of  it  shared;  that  is,  the  direction  of 
it  shared  and  the  profits  of  it  shared.  But  when  I  say 
“shared”  I  mean  it  in  the  modern  mercantile  sense 
of  the  word  “shares.”  That  is,  I  mean  something  di¬ 
vided  and  not  merely  something  pooled.  Our  busi¬ 
ness  friends  bustle  forward  to  tell  us  that  all  this  is 
impossible;  completely  unconscious,  apparently,  that 
all  this  part  of  the  business  exists  already.  You  can¬ 
not  distribute  a  steam-engine,  in  the  sense  of  giving 
one  wheel  to  each  shareholder  to  take  home  with  him, 
clasped  in  his  arms.  But  you  not  only  can,  but  you  al¬ 
ready  do  distribute  the  ownership  and  profit  of  the 
steam-engine;  and  you  distribute  it  in  the  form  of  pri¬ 
vate  property.  Only  you  do  not  distribute  it  enough, 
or  to  the  right  people,  or  to  the  people  who  really  re¬ 
quire  it  or  could  really  do  work  for  it.  Now  there  are 
many  schemes  having  this  normal  and  general  char¬ 
acter;  almost  any  one  of  which  I  should  prefer  to  the 
concentration  presented  by  capitalism  or  promised  by 
communism.  My  own  preference,  on  the  whole,  would 
be  that  any  such  necessary  machine  should  be  owned 
by  a  small  local  guild,  on  principles  of  profit-sharing, 


168 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


or  rather  profit-dividing:  but  of  real  profit-sharing 
and  real  profit-dividing,  not  to  be  confounded  with 
capitalist  patronage. 

Touching  the  last  point,  it  may  be  well  to  say  in 
passing  that  what  I  say  about  the  problem  of  profit- 
sharing  is  in  that  respect  parallel  to  what  I  say  also 
about  the  problem  of  emigration.  The  real  difficulty 
of  starting  it  in  the  right  way  is  that  it  has  so  often 
been  started  in  the  wrong  way;  and  especially  in  the 
wrong  spirit.  There  is  a  certain  amount  of  prejudice 
against  profit-sharing,  just  as  there  is  a  certain 
amount  of  prejudice  against  emigration,  in  the  indus¬ 
trial  democracy  of  to-day.  It  is  due  in  both  cases  to 
the  type  and  especially  the  tone  of  the  proposals.  I 
entirely  sympathize  with  the  Trade  Unionist  who  dis¬ 
likes  a  certain  sort  of  condescending  capitalist  con¬ 
cession;  and  the  spirit  which  gives  every  man  a  place 
in  the  sun  which  turns  out  to  be  a  place  in  Port  Sun¬ 
light.  Similarly,  I  quite  sympathize  with  Mr.  Kirk¬ 
wood  when  he  resented  being  lectured  about  emigra¬ 
tion  by  Sir  Alfred  Mond,  to  the  extent  of  saying, 

‘  The  Scots  will  leave  Scotland  when  the  German  Jews 
leave  England.”  But  I  think  it  would  be  possible  to 
have  a  more  genuinely  egalitarian  emigration,  with 
a  positive  policy  of  self-government  for  the  poor,  to 
which  Mr.  Kirkwood  might  be  kind;  and  I  think  that 
profit-sharing  that  began  at  the  popular  end,  estab¬ 
lishing  first  the  property  of  a  guild  and  not  merely 
the  caprice  of  an  employer,  would  not  contradict  any 


THE  WHEEL  OF  FATE 


169 


true  principle  of  Trades  Unions.  For  the  moment, 
however,  I  am  only  saying  that  something  could  be 
done  with  what  lies  nearest  to  us;  quite  apart  from 
our  general  ideal  about  the  position  of  machinery  in 
an  ideal  social  state.  I  understand  what  is  meant  by 
saying  that  the  ideal  in  both  cases  depends  upon  the 
wrong  ideals.  But  I  do  not  understand  what  our 
critics  mean  by  saying  that  it  is  impossible  to  divide 
the  shares  and  profits  in  a  machine  among  definite 
individuals.  Any  healthy  man  in  any  historical  pe¬ 
riod  would  have  thought  it  a  project  far  more  practi¬ 
cable  than  a  Milk  Trust. 


II 


THE  ROMANCE  OF  MACHINERY 

I  have  repeatedly  asked  the  reader  to  remember 
that  my  general  view  of  our  potential  future  divides 
itself  into  two  parts.  First,  there  is  the  policy  of  re¬ 
versing,  or  even  merely  of  resisting,  the  modern  tend¬ 
ency  to  monopoly  or  the  concentration  of  capital. 
Let  it  be  noted  that  this  is  a  policy  because  it  is  a 
direction,  if  pursued  in  any  degree.  In  one  sense,  in¬ 
deed,  he  who  is  not  with  us  is  against  us;  because  if 
that  tendency  is  not  resisted,  it  will  prevail.  But  in 
another  sense  anyone  who  resists  it  at  all  is  with  us; 
even  if  he  would  not  go  so  far  in  the  reversal  as  we 
should.  In  trying  to  reverse  the  concentration  at  all, 
he  is  helping  us  to  do  what  nobody  has  done  yet.  He 
will  be  setting  himself  against  the  trend  of  his  age, 
or  at  least  of  recent  ages.  And  a  man  can  work  in  our 
direction,  instead  of  the  existing  and  contrary  direc¬ 
tion,  even  with  the  existing  and  perhaps  contrary  ma¬ 
chinery.  Even  while  we  remain  industrial,  we  can 
work  towards  industrial  distribution  and  away  from 
industrial  monopoly.  Even  while  we  live  in  town 
houses,  we  can  own  town  houses.  Even  while  we  are 
a  nation  of  shopkeepers,  we  can  try  to  own  our  shops. 
Even  while  we  are  the  workshop  of  the  world,  we  can 

170 


THE  ROMANCE  OF  MACHINERY  171 

try  to  own  our  tools.  Even  if  our  town  is  covered  with 
advertisements,  it  can  be  covered  with  different  ad¬ 
vertisements.  If  the  mark  of  our  whole  society  is  the 
trade-mark,  it  need  not  be  the  same  trade-mark.  In 
short,  there  is  a  perfectly  tenable  and  practicable 
policy  of  resisting  mercantile  monopoly  even  in  a  mer¬ 
cantile  state.  And  we  say  that  a  great  many  people 
ought  to  support  us  in  that,  who  might  not  agree  with 
our  ultimate  ideal  of  a  state  that  should  not  be  mer¬ 
cantile — or  rather  a  state  that  should  not  be  entirely 
mercantile.  We  cannot  call  on  England  as  a  nation  of 
peasants,  as  France  or  Serbia  is  a  nation  of  peasants. 
But  we  can  call  on  England  that  has  been  a  nation 
of  shopkeepers  to  resist  being  turned  into  one  big 
Yankee  store. 

That  is  why  in  beginning  here  the  discussion  of  ma¬ 
chinery  I  pointed  out,  first,  that  in  the  ultimate  sense 
we  are  free  to  destroy  machinery;  and  second,  that  in 
the  immediate  sense  it  is  possible  to  divide  the  owner¬ 
ship  of  machinery.  And  I  should  say  myself  that  even 
in  a  healthy  state  there  would  be  some  ownership  of 
machinery  to  divide.  But  when  we  come  to  consider 
that  larger  test,  we  must  say  something  about  the  defi¬ 
nition  of  machinery,  and  even  the  ideal  of  machinery. 
Now  I  have  a  great  deal  of  sympathy  with  what  I 
may  call  the  sentimental  argument  for  machinery. 
Of  all  the  critics  who  have  rebuked  us,  the  man  I  like 
best  is  the  engineer  who  says:  “But  I  do  like  ma¬ 
chinery — just  as  you  like  mythology.  Why  should  I 


172  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

have  my  toys  taken  away  any  more  than  you?”  And 
of  the  various  positions  that  I  have  to  meet,  I  will 
begin  with  his.  Now  on  a  previous  page  I  said  I  agreed 
with  Mr.  Penty  that  it  would  be  a  human  right  to 
abandon  machinery  altogether.  I  will  add  here  that  I 
do  not  agree  with  Mr.  Penty  in  thinking  machinery 
like  magic — a  mere  malignant  power  or  origin  of 
evils.  It  seems  to  me  quite  as  materialistic  to  be 
damned  by  a  machine  as  saved  by  a  machine.  It  seems 
to  me  quite  as  idolatrous  to  blaspheme  it  as  to  wor¬ 
ship  it.  But  even  supposing  that  somebody,  without 
worshipping  it,  is  yet  enjoying  it  imaginatively  and 
in  some  sense  mystically,  the  case  as  we  state  it  still 
stands. 

Nobody  would  be  more  really  unsuitable  to  the  ma¬ 
chine  age  than  a  man  who  really  admired  machines. 
The  modern  system  presupposes  people  who  will  take 
mechanism  mechanically;  not  people  who  will  take  it 
mystically.  An  amusing  story  might  be  written  about 
a  poet  who  was  really  appreciative  of  the  fairy-tales 
of  science,  and  who  found  himself  more  of  an  obsta¬ 
cle  in  the  scientific  civilization  than  if  he  had  delayed 
it  by  telling  the  fairy-tales  of  infancy.  Suppose  when¬ 
ever  he  went  to  the  telephone  (bowing  three  times  as 
he  approached  the  shrine  of  the  disembodied  oracle 
and  murmuring  some  appropriate  form  of  words  such 
as  vox  et  prceterea  nihil),  he  were  to  act  as  if  he  really 
valued  the  significance  of  the  instrument.  Suppose  he 
were  to  fall  into  a  trembling  ecstasy  on  hearing  from  a 


THE  ROMANCE  OF  MACHINERY  173 


distant  exchange  the  voice  of  an  unknown  young 
woman  in  a  remote  town,  were  to  linger  upon  the  very 
real  wonder  of  that  momentary  meeting  in  mid-air 
with  a  human  spirit  whom  he  would  never  see  on 
earth,  were  to  speculate  on  her  life  and  personality, 
so  real  and  yet  so  remote  from  his  own,  were  to  pause 
to  ask  a  few  personal  questions  about  her,  just  suffi¬ 
cient  to  accentuate  her  human  strangeness,  were  to 
ask  whether  she  also  had  not  some  sense  of  this  weird 
psychical  tete-a-tete,  created  and  dissolved  in  an  in¬ 
stant,  whether  she  also  thought  of  those  unthinkable 
leagues  of  valley  and  forest  that  lay  between  the  mov¬ 
ing  mouth  and  the  listening  ear — suppose,  in  short,  he 
were  to  say  all  this  to  the  lady  at  the  Exchange  who 
was  just  about  to  put  him  on  to  666  Upper  Tooting. 
He  would  be  really  and  truly  expressing  the  senti¬ 
ment,  “Wonderful  thing,  the  telephone!”;  and,  unlike 
the  thousands  who  say  it,  he  would  actually  mean  it. 
He  would  be  really  and  truly  justifying  the  great  sci¬ 
entific  discoveries  and  doing  honour  to  the  great  sci¬ 
entific  inventors.  He  would  indeed  be  the  worthy  son 
of  a  scientific  age.  And  yet  I  fear  that  in  a  scientific 
age  he  would  possibly  be  misunderstood,  and  even 
suffer  from  lack  of  sympathy.  I  fear  that  he  would,  in 
fact,  be  in  practice  an  opponent  of  all  that  he  desired 
to  uphold.  He  would  be  a  worse  enemy  of  machinery 
than  any  Luddite  smashing  machines.  He  would  ob¬ 
struct  the  activities  of  the  telephone  exchange,  by 
praising  the  beauties  of  the  telephone,  more  than  if 


174  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

he  had  sat  down,  like  a  more  normal  and  traditional 
poet,  to  tell  all  those  bustling  business  people  about 
the  beauties  of  a  wayside  flower. 

It  would  of  course  be  the  same  with  any  adventure 
of  the  same  luckless  admiration.  If  a  philosopher, 
when  taken  for  the  first  time  for  a  ride  in  a  motor¬ 
car,  were  to  fall  into  such  an  enthusiasm  for  the  mar¬ 
vel  that  he  insisted  on  understanding  the  whole  of  the 
mechanism  on  the  spot,  it  is  probable  that  he  would 
have  got  to  his  destination  rather  quicker  if  he  had 
walked.  If  he  were,  in  his  simple  zeal,  to  insist  on  the 
machine  being  taken  to  pieces  in  the  road,  that  he 
might  rejoice  in  the  inmost  secrets  of  its  structure,  he 
might  even  lose  his  popularity  with  the  garage  taxi- 
driver  or  chauffeur.  Now  we  have  all  known  children, 
for  instance,  who  did  really  in  this  fashion  want  to  see 
wheels  go  round.  But  though  their  attitude  may  bring 
them  nearest  to  the  kingdom  of  heaven,  it  does  not 
necessarily  bring  them  nearer  to  the  end  of  the  jour¬ 
ney.  They  are  admiring  motors;  but  they  are  not 
motoring — that  is,  they  are  not  necessarily  moving. 
They  are  not  serving  that  purpose  which  motoring 
was  meant  to  serve.  Now  as  a  matter  of  fact  this  con¬ 
tradiction  has  ended  in  a  congestion;  and  a  sort  of 
stagnant  state  of  the  spirit  in  which  there  is  rather 
less  real  appreciation  of  the  marvels  of  man’s  in¬ 
vention  than  if  the  poet  confined  himself  to  making  a 
penny  whistle  (on  which  to  pipe  in  the  woods  of  Ar- 
cady)  or  the  child  confined  himself  to  making  a  toy 


THE  ROMANCE  OF  MACHINERY  175 


bow  or  a  catapult.  The  child  really  is  happy  with  a 
beautiful  happiness  every  time  he  lets  fly  an  arrow. 
It  is  by  no  means  certain  that  the  business  man  is 
happy  with  a  beautiful  happiness  every  time  he  sends 
off  a  telegram.  The  very  name  of  a  telegram  is  a 
poem,  even  more  magical  than  the  arrow;  for  it 
means  a  dart,  and  a  dart  that  writes.  Think  what  the 
child  would  feel  if  he  could  shoot  a  pencil-arrow  that 
drew  a  picture  at  the  other  end  of  the  valley  or  the 
long  street.  Yet  the  business  man  but  seldom  dances 
and  claps  his  hands  for  joy,  at  the  thought  of  this, 
whenever  he  sends  a  telegram. 

Now  this  has  a  considerable  relevancy  to  the  real 
criticism  of  the  modern  mechanical  civilization.  Its 
supporters  are  always  telling  us  of  its  marvellous  in¬ 
ventions  and  proving  that  they  are  marvellous  im¬ 
provements.  But  it  is  highly  doubtful  whether  they 
really  feel  them  as  improvements.  For  instance,  I 
have  heard  it  said  a  hundred  times  that  glass  is  an 
excellent  illustration  of  the  way  in  which  something 
becomes  a  convenience  for  everybody.  “Look  at  glass 
in  windows,”  they  say;  “that  has  been  turned  into  a 
mere  necessity;  yet  that  also  was  once  a  luxury.” 
And  I  always  feel  disposed  to  answer,  “Yes,  and  it 
would  be  better  for  people  like  you  if  it  were  still  a 
luxury;  if  that  would  induce  you  to  look  at  it,  and 
not  only  to  look  through  it.  Do  you  ever  consider 
how  magical  a  thing  is  that  invisible  film  standing 
between  you  and  the  birds  and  the  wind?  Do  you  ever 


176 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


think  of  it  as  water  hung  in  the  air  or  a  flattened 
diamond  too  clear  to  be  even  valued?  Do  you  ever 
feel  a  window  as  a  sudden  opening  in  a  wall?  And 
if  you  do  not,  what  is  the  good  of  glass  to  you?” 
This  may  be  a  little  exaggerated,  in  the  heat  of  the 
moment,  but  it  is  really  true  that  in  these  things  in¬ 
vention  outstrips  imagination.  Humanity  has  not  got 
the  good  out  of  its  own  inventions;  and  by  making 
more  and  more  inventions,  it  is  only  leaving  its  own 
power  of  happiness  further  and  further  behind. 

I  remarked  in  an  earlier  part  of  this  particular 
meditation  that  machinery  was  not  necessarily  evil, 
and  that  there  were  some  who  valued  it  in  the  right 
spirit,  but  that  most  of  those  who  had  to  do  with 
it  never  had  a  chance  of  valuing  it  at  all.  A  poet 
might  enjoy  a  clock  as  a  child  enjoys  a  musical-box. 
But  the  actual  clerk  who  looks  at  the  actual  clock, 
to  see  that  he  is  just  in  time  to  catch  the  train  for 
the  city,  is  no  more  enjoying  machinery  than  he  is 
enjoying  music.  There  may  be  something  to  be  said 
for  mechanical  toys;  but  modern  society  is  a  mecha¬ 
nism  and  not  a  toy.  The  child  indeed  is  a  good  test 
in  these  matters;  and  illustrates  both  the  fact  that 
there  is  an  interest  in  machinery  and  the  fact  that 
machinery  itself  generally  prevents  us  from  being  in¬ 
terested.  It  is  almost  a  proverb  that  every  little  boy 
wants  to  be  an  engine-driver.  But  machinery  has  not 
multiplied  the  number  of  engine-drivers,  so  as  to 
allow  all  little  boys  to  drive  engines.  It  has  not  given 


THE  ROMANCE  OF  MACHINERY  177 


each  little  boy  a  real  engine,  as  his  family  might  give 
him  a  toy  engine.  The  effect  of  railways  on  a  popula¬ 
tion  cannot  be  to  produce  a  population  of  engine- 
drivers.  It  can  only  produce  a  population  of  pas¬ 
sengers;  and  of  passengers  a  little  too  like  packages. 
In  other  words,  its  only  effect  on  the  visionary  or  po¬ 
tential  engine-driver  is  to  put  him  inside  the  train, 
where  he  cannot  see  the  engine,  instead  of  outside  the 
train  where  he  can.  And  though  he  grows  up  to  the 
greatest  and  most  glorious  success  in  life,  and  swindles 
the  widow  and  orphan  till  he  can  travel  in  a  first- 
class  carriage  specially  reserved,  with  a  permanent 
pass  to  the  International  Congress  of  Cosmopolitan 
World  Peace  for  Wire-Pullers,  he  will  never  perhaps 
enjoy  a  railway  train  again,  he  will  never  even  see  a 
railway  train  again,  as  he  saw  it  when  he  stood  as  a 
ragged  urchin  and  waved  wildly  from  a  grassy  bank 
at  the  passage  of  the  Scotch  Express. 

We  may  transfer  the  parable  from  engine-drivers 
to  engineers.  It  may  be  that  the  driver  of  the  Scotch 
Express  hurls  himself  forward  in  a  fury  of  speed  be¬ 
cause  his  heart  is  in  the  Highlands,  his  heart  is  not 
here;  that  he  spurns  the  Border  behind  him  with  a 
gesture  and  hails  the  Grampians  before  him  with  a 
cheer.  And  whether  or  no  it  is  true  that  the  engine- 
driver’s  heart  is  in  the  Highlands,  it  is  sometimes  true 
that  the  little  boy’s  heart  is  in  the  engine.  But  it  is 
by  no  means  true  that  passengers  as  a  whole,  travel¬ 
ling  behind  engines  as  a  whole,  enjoy  the  speed  in  a 


178  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

positive  sense,  though  they  may  approve  of  it  in  a 
negative  sense.  I  mean  that  they  wish  to  travel 
swiftly,  not  because  swift  travelling  is  enjoyable,  but 
because  it  is  not  enjoyable.  They  want  it  rushed 
through;  not  because  being  behind  the  railway-engine 
is  a  rapture,  but  because  being  in  the  railway-carriage 
is  a  bore.  In  the  same  way,  if  we  consider  the  joy  of 
engineers,  we  must  remember  that  there  is  only  one 
joyful  engineer  to  a  thousand  bored  victims  of  en¬ 
gineering.  The  discussion  that  raged  between  Mr. 
Penty  and  others  at  one  time  threatened  to  resolve  it¬ 
self  into  a  feud  between  engineers  and  architects.  But 
when  the  engineer  asks  us  to  forget  all  the  monot¬ 
ony  and  materialism  of  a  mechanical  age  because  his 
own  science  has  some  of  the  inspiration  of  an  art, 
the  architect  may  well  be  ready  with  a  reply.  For 
this  is  very  much  as  if  architects  were  never  engaged 
in  anything  but  the  building  of  prisons  and  lunatic 
asylums.  It  is  as  if  they  told  us  proudly  with  what 
passionate  and  poetical  enthusiasm  they  had  them¬ 
selves  reared  towers  high  enough  for  the  hanging  of 
Haman  or  dug  dungeons  impenetrable  enough  for  the 
starving  of  Ugolino. 

Now  I  have  already  explained  that  I  do  not  pro¬ 
pose  anything  in  what  some  call  the  practical  way, 
but  should  rather  be  called  the  immediate  way,  be¬ 
yond  the  better  distribution  of  the  ownership  of  such 
machines  as  are  really  found  to  be  necessary.  But 
when  we  come  to  the  larger  question  of  machinery 


THE  ROMANCE  OF  MACHINERY  179 

in  a  fundamentally  different  sort  of  society,  governed 
by  our  philosophy  and  religion,  there  is  a  great  deal 
more  to  be  said.  The  best  and  shortest  way  of  say¬ 
ing  it  is  that  instead  of  the  machine  being  a  giant  to 
which  the  man  is  a  pygmy,  we  must  at  least  reverse 
the  proportions  until  man  is  a  giant  to  whom  the 
machine  is  a  toy.  Granted  that  idea,  and  we  have 
no  reason  to  deny  that  it  might  be  a  legitimate  and 
enlivening  toy.  In  that  sense  it  would  not  matter 
if  every  child  were  an  engine-driver  or  (better  still) 
every  engine-driver  a  child.  But  those  who  were  al¬ 
ways  taunting  us  with  unpracticality  will  at  least 
admit  that  this  is  not  practical. 

I  have  thus  tried  to  put  myself  fairly  in  the  position 
of  the  enthusiast,  as  we  should  always  do  in  judging 
of  enthusiasms.  And  I  think  it  will  be  agreed  that 
even  after  the  experiment  a  real  difference  between 
the  engineering  enthusiasm  and  older  enthusiasms  re¬ 
mains  as  a  fact  of  common  sense.  Admitting  that  the 
man  who  designs  a  steam-engine  is  as  original  as  the 
man  who  designs  a  statue,  there  is  an  immediate  and 
immense  difference  in  the  effects  of  what  they  design. 
The  original  statue  is  a  joy  to  the  sculptor;  but  it  is 
also  in  some  degree  (when  it  is  not  too  original)  a 
joy  to  the  people  who  see  the  statue.  Or  at  any  rate 
it  is  meant  to  be  a  joy  to  other  people  seeing  it,  or 
there  would  be  no  point  in  letting  it  be  seen.  But 
though  the  engine  may  be  a  great  joy  to  the  engineer 
and  of  great  use  to  the  other  people,  it  is  not,  and  it 


180  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

is  not  meant  to  be,  in  the  same  sense  a  great  joy 
to  the  other  people.  Nor  is  this  because  of  a  deficiency 
in  education,  as  some  of  the  artists  might  allege  in 
the  case  of  art.  It  is  involved  in  the  very  nature  of 
machinery;  which,  when  once  it  is  established,  con¬ 
sists  of  repetitions  and  not  of  variations  and  sur¬ 
prises.  A  man  can  see  something  in  the  limbs  of  a 
statue  which  he  never  saw  before;  they  may  seem  to 
toss  or  sweep  as  they  never  did  before;  but  he  would 
not  only  be  astonished  but  alarmed  if  the  wheels  of 
the  steam-engine  began  to  behave  as  they  never  did 
before.  We  may  take  it,  therefore,  as  an  essential  and 
not  an  accidental  character  of  machinery  that  it  is 
an  inspiration  for  the  inventor  but  merely  a  monot¬ 
ony  for  the  consumer. 

This  being  so,  it  seems  to  me  that  in  an  ideal  state 
engineering -would  be  the  exception,  just  as  the  de¬ 
light  in  engines  is  the  exception.  As  it  is,  engineering 
and  engines  are  the  rule;  and  are  even  a  grinding  and 
oppressive  rule.  The  lifelessness  which  the  machine 
imposes  on  the  masses  is  an  infinitely  bigger  and 
more  obvious  fact  than  the  individual  interest  of  the 
man  who  makes  machines.  Having  reached  this  point 
in  the  argument,  we  may  well  compare  it  with  what 
may  be  called  the  practical  aspect  of  the  problem  of 
machinery.  Now  it  seems  to  me  obvious  that  machin¬ 
ery,  as  it  exists  to-day,  has  gone  almost  as  much  be¬ 
yond  its  practical  sphere  as  it  has  beyond  its  imagina¬ 
tive  sphere.  The  whole  of  industrial  society  is  founded 


THE  ROMANCE  OF  MACHINERY  181 

on  the  notion  that  the  quickest  and  cheapest  thing  is 
to  carry  coals  to  Newcastle;  even  if  it  be  only  with 
the  object  of  afterwards  carrying  them  from  New¬ 
castle.  It  is  founded  on  the  idea  that  rapid  and  regu¬ 
lar  transit  and  transport,  perpetual  interchange  of 
goods,  and  incessant  communication  between  remote 
places,  is  of  all  things  the  most  economical  and  direct. 
But  it  is  not  true  that  the  quickest  and  cheapest 
thing,  for  a  man  who  has  just  pulled  an  apple  from 
an  apple  tree,  is  to  send  it  in  a  consignment  of  apples 
on  a  train  that  goes  like  a  thunderbolt  to  a  market  at 
the  other  end  of  England.  The  quickest  and  cheap¬ 
est  thing  for  a  man  who  has  pulled  a  fruit  from  a 
tree  is  to  put  it  in  his  mouth.  He  is  the  supreme 
economist  who  wastes  no  money  on  railway  journeys. 
He  is  the  absolute  type  of  efficiency  who  is  far  too 
efficient  to  go  in  for  organization.  And  though  he  is, 
of  course,  an  extreme  and  ideal  case  of  simplification, 
the  case  for  simplification  does  stand  as  solid  as  an 
apple  tree.  In  so  far  as  men  can  produce  their  own 
goods  on  the  spot,  they  are  saving  the  community  a 
vast  expenditure  which  is  often  quite  out  of  propor¬ 
tion  to  the  return.  In  so  far  as  we  can  establish  a 
considerable  proportion  of  simple  and  self-supporting 
people,  we  are  relieving  the  pressure  of  what  is  often 
a  wasteful  as  well  as  a  harassing  process.  And  taking 
this  as  a  general  outline  of  the  reform,  it  does  appear 
true  that  a  simpler  life  in  large  areas  of  the  com¬ 
munity  might  leave  machinery  more  or  less  as  an  ex- 


182  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

ceptional  thing;  as  it  may  well  be  to  the  exceptional 
man  who  really  puts  his  soul  into  it. 

There  are  difficulties  in  this  view;  but  for  the  mo¬ 
ment  I  may  well  take  as  an  illustration  the  parallel 
of  the  particular  sort  of  modern  engineering  which 
moderns  are  very  fond  of  denouncing.  They  often 
forget  that  most  of  their  praise  of  scientific  instru¬ 
ments  applies  most  vividly  to  scientific  weapons.  If 
we  are  to  have  so  much  pity  for  the  unhappy  genius 
who  has  just  invented  a  new  galvanometer,  what 
about  the  poor  genius  who  has  just  invented  a  new 
gun?  If  there  is  a  real  imaginative  inspiration  in  the 
making  of  a  steam-engine,  is  there  not  imaginative 
interest  in  the  making  of  a  submarine?  Yet  many 
modern  admirers  of  science  would  be  very  anxious  to 
abolish  these  machines  altogether;  even  in  the  very 
act  of  telling  us  that  we  cannot  abolish  machines  at 
all.  As  I  believe  in  the  right  of  national  self-defence, 
I  would  not  abolish  them  altogether.  But  I  think  they 
may  give  us  a  hint  of  how  exceptional  things  may  be 
treated  exceptionally.  For  the  moment  I  will  leave  the 
progressive  to  laugh  at  my  absurd  notion  of  a  limita¬ 
tion  of  machines,  and  go  off  to  a  meeting  to  demand 
the  limitation  of  armaments. 


Ill 


THE  HOLIDAY  OF  THE  SLAVE 

I  have  sometimes  suggested  that  industrialism  of 
the  American  type,  with  its  machinery  and  mechanical 
hustle,  will  some  day  be  preserved  on  a  truly  Ameri¬ 
can  model;  I  mean  in  the  manner  of  the  Red  Indian 
Reservation.  As  we  leave  a  patch  of  forest  for  sav¬ 
ages  to  hunt  and  fish  in,  so  a  higher  civilization  might 
leave  a  patch  of  factories  for  those  who  are  still  at 
such  a  stage  of  intellectual  infancy  as  really  to  want 
to  see  the  wheels  go  round.  And  as  the  Red  Indians 
could  still,  I  suppose,  tell  their  quaint  old  legends  of 
a  red  god  who  smoked  a  pipe  or  a  red  hero  who  stole 
the  sun  and  moon,  so  the  simple  folk  in  the  industrial 
enclosure  could  go  on  talking  of  their  own  Outline  of 
History  and  discussing  the  evolution  of  ethics,  while 
all  around  them  a  more  mature  civilization  was  deal¬ 
ing  with  real  history  and  serious  philosophy.  I  hesi¬ 
tate  to  repeat  this  fancy  here;  for,  after  all,  machinery 
is  their  religion,  or  at  any  rate  superstition,  and  they 
do  not  like  it  to  be  treated  with  levity.  But  I  do  think 
there  is  something  to  be  said  for  the  notion  of  which 
this  fancy  might  stand  as  a  sort  of  symbol;  for  the 
idea  that  a  wiser  society  would  eventually  treat  ma¬ 
chines  as  it  treats  weapons,  as  something  special 

183 


184  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

and  dangerous  and  perhaps  more  directly  under  a 
central  control.  But  however  this  may  be,  I  do  think 
the  wildest  fancy  of  a  manufacturer  kept  at  bay  like 
a  painted  barbarian  is  much  more  sane  than  a  serious 
scientific  alternative  now  often  put  before  us.  I  mean 
what  its  friends  call  the  Leisure  State,  in  which  every¬ 
thing  is  to  be  done  by  machinery.  It  is  only  right  to 
say  a  word  about  this  suggestion  in  comparison  with 
our  own. 

In  practice  we  already  know  what  is  meant  by  a 
holiday  in  a  world  of  machinery  and  mass  production. 
It  means  that  a  man,  when  he  has  done  turning  a 
handle,  has  a  choice  of  certain  pleasures  offered  to 
him.  He  can,  if  he  likes,  read  a  newspaper  and  dis¬ 
cover  with  interest  how  the  Crown  Prince  of  Fon- 
tarabia  landed  from  the  magnificent  yacht  Atlantis 
amid  a  cheering  crowd;  how  certain  great  American 
millionaires  are  making  great  financial  consolidations; 
how  the  Modern  Girl  is  a  delightful  creature,  in  spite 
of  (or  because  of)  having  shingled  hair  or  short  skirts; 
and  how  the  true  religion,  for  which  we  all  look  to 
the  Churches,  consists  of  sympathy  and  social  prog¬ 
ress  and  marrying,  divorcing,  or  burying  everybody 
without  reference  to  the  precise  meaning  of  the  cere¬ 
mony.  On  the  other  hand,  if  he  prefers  some  other 
amusement,  he  may  go  to  the  Cinema,  where  he  will 
see  a  very  vivid  and  animated  scene  of  the  crowds 
cheering  the  Crown  Prince  of  Fontarabia  after  the 
arrival  of  the  yacht  Atlantis ;  where  he  will  see  an 


THE  HOLIDAY  OF  THE  SLAVE  185 


American  film  featuring  the  features  of  American  mil¬ 
lionaires,  with  all  those  resolute  contortions  of  visage 
which  accompany  their  making  of  great  financial 
consolidations;  where  there  will  not  be  lacking  a 
charming  and  vivacious  heroine,  recognizable  as  a 
Modern  Girl  by  her  short  hair  and  short  skirts;  and 
possibly  a  kind  and  good  clergyman  (if  any)  who 
explains  in  dumb  show,  with  the  aid  of  a  few  printed 
sentences,  that  true  religion  is  social  sympathy  and 
progress  and  marrying  and  burying  people  at  ran¬ 
dom.  But  supposing  the  man’s  tastes  to  be  detached 
from  the  drama  and  from  the  kindred  arts,  he  may 
prefer  the  reading  of  fiction;  and  he  will  have  no  dif¬ 
ficulty  in  finding  a  popular  novel  about  the  doubts 
and  difficulties  of  a  good  and  kind  clergyman  slowly 
discovering  that  true  religion  consists  of  progress  and 
social  sympathy,  with  the  assistance  of  a  Modern 
Girl  whose  shingled  hair  and  short  skirts  proclaim 
her  indifference  to  all  fine  distinctions  about  who 
should  be  buried  and  who  divorced;  nor,  probably, 
will  the  story  fail  to  contain  an  American  millionaire 
making  vast  financial  consolidations,  and  certainly  a 
yacht  and  possibly  a  Crown  Prince.  But  there  are  yet 
other  tastes  that  are  catered  for  under  the  conditions 
of  modern  publicity  and  pleasure-seeking.  There  is 
the  great  institution  of  wireless  or  broadcasting;  and 
the  holiday-maker,  turning  away  from  fiction,  jour¬ 
nalism,  and  film  drama,  may  prefer  to  “listen-in” 
to  a  programme  that  will  contain  the  very  latest  news 


186  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

of  great  financial  consolidations  made  by  American 
millionaires;  which  will  most  probably  contain  little 
lectures  on  how  the  Modern  Girl  can  crop  her  hair 
or  abbreviate  her  skirts;  in  which  he  can  hear  the 
very  accents  of  some  great  popular  preacher  proclaim¬ 
ing  to  the  world  that  revelation  of  true  religion  which 
consists  of  sympathy  and  social  progress  rather  than 
of  dogma  and  creed;  and  in  which  he  will  certainly 
hear  the  very  thunder  of  cheering  which  welcomes 
His  Royal  Highness  the  Crown  Prince  of  Fontarabia 
when  he  lands  from  the  magnificent  yacht  Atlantis. 
There  is  thus  indeed  a  very  elaborate  and  well-ordered 
choice  placed  before  him,  in  the  matter  of  the  means 
of  entertainment. 

But  even  the  rich  variety  of  method  and  approach 
unfolded  before  us  in  this  alternative  seems  to  some 
to  cover  a  certain  secret  and  subtle  element  of  monot¬ 
ony.  Even  here  the  pleasure-seeker  may  have  that 
weird  psychological  sensation  of  having  known  the 
same  thing  before.  There  seems  to  be  something  re¬ 
current  about  the  type  of  topic;  suggestive  of  some¬ 
thing  rigid  about  the  type  of  mind.  Now  I  think  it 
very  doubtful  whether  it  is  really  a  superior  mind. 
If  the  pleasure-seeker  himself  were  really  a  pleasure- 
maker  for  himself,  if  he  were  forced  to  amuse  him¬ 
self  instead  of  being  amused,  if  he  were,  in  short, 
obliged  to  sit  down  in  an  old  tavern  and  talk — I  am 
really  very  doubtful  about  whether  he  would  confine 
his  conversation  entirely  to  the  Crown  Prince  of  Fon- 


THE  HOLIDAY  OF  THE  SLAVE  187 

tarabia,  the  shingling  of  hair,  the  greatness  of  certain 
rich  Yankees,  and  so  on;  and  then  begin  the  same 
round  of  subjects  all  over  again.  His  interests  might 
be  more  local,  but  they  would  be  more  lively;  his  ex¬ 
perience  of  men  more  personal  but  more  mixed;  his 
likes  and  dislikes  more  capricious  but  not  quite  so 
easily  satisfied.  To  take  a  parallel,  modern  children 
are  made  to  play  public-school  games,  and  will  doubt¬ 
less  soon  be  made  to  listen  to  the  praise  of  the  mil¬ 
lionaires  on  the  wireless  and  in  the  newspaper.  But 
children  left  to  themselves  almost  invariably  invent 
games  of  their  own,  dramas  of  their  own,  often  whole 
imaginary  kingdoms  and  commonwealths  of  their 
own.  In  other  words,  they  produce;  until  the  compe¬ 
tition  of  monopoly  kills  their  production.  The  boy 
playing  at  robbers  is  not  liberated  but  stunted  by 
learning  about  American  crooks,  all  of  one  pattern 
less  picturesque  than  his  own.  He  is  psychologi¬ 
cally  undercut,  undersold,  dumped  upon,  frozen  out, 
flooded,  swamped,  and  ruined;  but  not  emancipated. 

Inventions  have  destroyed  invention.  The  big  mod¬ 
ern  machines  are  like  big  guns  dominating  and  terror¬ 
izing  a  whole  stretch  of  country,  within  the  range  of 
which  nothing  can  raise  its  head.  There  is  far  more 
inventiveness  to  the  square  yard  of  mankind  than 
can  ever  appear  under  that  monopolist  terror.  The 
minds  of  men  are  not  so  much  alike  as  the  motor-cars 
of  men,  or  the  morning  papers  of  men,  or  the  me¬ 
chanical  manufacture  of  the  coats  and  hats  of  men. 


188  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

In  other  words,  we  are  not  getting  the  best  out  of  men. 
We  are  certainly  not  getting  the  most  individual  or 
the  most  interesting  qualities  out  of  men.  And  it  is 
doubtful  whether  we  ever  shall,  until  we  shut  off 
this  deafening  din  of  megaphones  that  drowns  their 
voices,  this  deathly  glare  of  limelight  which  kills  the 
colours  of  their  complexions,  this  plangent  yell  of 
platitudes  which  stuns  and  stops  their  minds.  All  this 
sort  of  thing  is  killing  thoughts  as  they  grow,  as  a 
great  white  death-ray  might  kill  plants  as  they  grow. 
When,  therefore,  people  tell  me  that  making  a  great 
part  of  England  rustic  and  self-supporting  would 
mean  making  it  rude  and  senseless,  I  do  not  agree 
with  them;  and  I  do  not  think  they  understand  the 
alternative  or  the  problem.  Nobody  wants  all  men 
to  be  rustics  even  in  normal  times;  it  is  very  tenable 
that  some  of  the  most  intelligent  would  turn  to  the 
towns  even  in  normal  times.  But  I  say  the  towns 
themselves  are  the  foes  of  intelligence,  in  these  times; 
I  say  the  rustics  themselves  would  have  more  variety 
and  vivacity  than  is  really  encouraged  by  these  towns. 
I  say  it  is  only  by  shutting  off  this  unnatural  noise 
and  light  that  men’s  minds  can  begin  again  to  move 
and  to  grow.  Just  as  we  spread  paving-stones  over 
different  soils  without  reference  to  the  different  crops 
that  might  grow  there,  so  we  spread  programmes  of 
platitudinous  plutocracy  over  souls  that  God  made 
various,  and  simpler  societies  have  made  free. 

If  by  machinery  saving  labour,  and  therefore  pro- 


THE  HOLIDAY  OF  THE  SLAVE  189 


ducing  leisure,  be  meant  the  machinery  that  now 
achieves  what  is  called  mass  production,  I  cannot  see 
any  vital  value  in  the  leisure;  because  there  is  in  that 
leisure  nothing  of  liberty.  The  man  may  only  work 
for  an  hour  with  his  machine-made  tools,  but  he  can 
only  run  away  and  play  for  twenty-three  hours  with 
machine-made  toys.  Everything  he  handles  has  to 
come  from  a  huge  machine  that  he  cannot  handle. 
Everything  must  come  from  something  to  which,  in 
the  current  capitalist  phrase,  he  can  only  lend  "a 
hand.”  Now  as  this  would  apply  to  intellectual  and 
artistic  toys  as  well  as  to  merely  material  toys,  it 
seems  to  me  that  the  machine  would  dominate  him 
for  a  much  longer  time  than  his  hand  had  to  turn  the 
handle.  It  is  practically  admitted  that  much  fewer 
men  are  needed  to  work  the  machine.  The  answer  of 
the  mechanical  collectivists  is  that  though  the  ma¬ 
chine  might  give  work  to  the  few,  it  could  give  food 
to  the  many.  But  it  could  only  give  food  to  the  many 
by  an  operation  that  had  to  be  presided  over  by  the 
few.  Or  even  if  we  suppose  that  some  work,  sub¬ 
divided  into  small  sections,  were  given  to  the  many, 
that  system  of  rotation  would  have  to  be  ruled  by  a 
responsible  few;  and  some  fixed  authority  would  be 
needed  to  distribute  the  work  as  much  as  to  distribute 
the  food.  In  other  words,  the  officials  would  very  de¬ 
cidedly  be  permanent  officials.  In  a  sense  all  the  rest 
of  us  might  be  intermittent  or  occasional  officials.  But 
the  general  character  of  the  system  would  remain; 


190  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

and  whatever  else  it  is  like,  nothing  can  make  it 
like  a  population  pottering  about  in  its  own  several 
fields  or  practising  small  creative  crafts  in  its  own 
little  workshops.  The  man  who  has  helped  to  pro¬ 
duce  a  machine-made  article  may  indeed  leave  off 
working,  in  the  sense  of  leaving  off  turning  one  par¬ 
ticular  wheel.  He  may  have  an  opportunity  to  do  as 
he  likes,  in  so  far  as  he  likes  using  what  the  system 
likes  producing.  He  may  have  a  power  of  choice — in 
the  sense  that  he  may  choose  between  one  thing  it  pro¬ 
duces  and  another  thing  it  produces.  He  may  choose 
to  pass  his  leisure  hours  in  sitting  in  a  machine- 
made  chair  or  lying  on  a  machine-made  bed  or  rest¬ 
ing  in  a  machine-made  hammock  or  swinging  on  a 
machine-made  trapeze.  But  he  will  not  be  in  the  same 
position  as  a  man  who  carves  his  own  hobby-horse 
out  of  his  own  wood  or  his  own  hobby  out  of  his  own 
will.  For  that  introduces  another  principle  or  pur¬ 
pose;  which  there  is  no  warrant  for  supposing  will 
coexist  with  the  principle  or  purpose  of  using  all  the 
wood  so  as  to  save  labour  or  simplifying  all  the  wills 
so  as  to  save  leisure.  If  our  ideal  is  to  produce  things 
as  rapidly  and  easily  as  possible,  we  must  have  a 
definite  number  of  things  that  we  desire  to  produce. 
If  we  desire  to  produce  them  as  freely  and  variously 
as  possible,  we  must  not  at  the  same  time  try  to 
produce  them  as  quickly  as  possible.  I  think  it  most 
probable  that  the  result  of  saving  labour  by  machin¬ 
ery  would  be  then  what  it  is  now,  only  more  so:  the 


THE  HOLIDAY  OF  THE  SLAVE  191 

limitation  of  the  type  of  thing  produced;  standard¬ 
ization. 

Now  it  may  be  that  some  of  the  supporters  of  the 
Leisure  State  have  in  mind  some  system  of  distrib¬ 
uted  machinery,  which  shall  really  make  each  man 
the  master  of  his  machine;  and  in  that  case  I  agree 
that  the  problem  becomes  different  and  that  a  great 
part  of  the  problem  is  resolved.  There  would  still 
remain  the  question  of  whether  a  man  with  a  free 
soul  would  want  to  use  a  machine  upon  about  three- 
quarters  of  the  things  for  which  machines  are  now 
used.  In  other  words,  there  would  remain  the  whole 
problem  of  the  craftsman  in  the  sense  of  the  creator. 
But  I  should  agree  that  if  the  small  man  found  his 
small  mechanical  plant  helpful  to  the  preservation 
of  his  small  property,  its  claim  would  be  very  con¬ 
siderable.  But  it  is  necessary  to  make  it  clear,  that 
if  the  holidays  provided  for  the  mechanic  are  pro¬ 
vided  as  mechanically  as  at  present,  and  with  the 
merely  mechanical  alternative  offered  at  present,  I 
think  that  even  the  slavery  of  his  labour  would  be 
light  compared  to  the  grinding  slavery  of  his  leisure. 


IV 


THE  FREE  MAN  AND  THE  FORD  CAR 

I  am  not  a  fanatic;  and  I  think  that  machines  may 
be  of  considerable  use  in  destroying  machinery.  I 
should  generously  accord  them  a  considerable  value 
in  the  work  of  exterminating  all  that  they  represent. 
But  to  put  the  truth  in  those  terms  is  to  talk  in  terms 
of  the  remote  conclusion  of  our  slow  and  reasonable 
revolution.  In  the  immediate  situation  the  same  truth 
may  be  stated  in  a  more  moderate  way.  Towards  all 
typical  things  of  our  time  we  should  have  a  rational 
charity.  Machinery  is  not  wrong;  it  is  only  absurd. 
Perhaps  we  should  say  it  is  merely  childish,  and  can 
even  be  taken  in  the  right  spirit  by  a  child.  If,  there¬ 
fore,  we  find  that  some  machine  enables  us  to  escape 
from  an  inferno  of  machinery,  we  cannot  be  com¬ 
mitting  a  sin  though  we  may  be  cutting  a  silly  fig¬ 
ure,  like  a  dragoon  rejoining  his  regiment  on  an  old 
bicycle.  What  is  essential  is  to  realize  that  there  is 
something  ridiculous  about  the  present  position,  some¬ 
thing  wilder  than  any  Utopia.  For  instance,  I  shall 
have  occasion  here  to  note  the  proposal  of  central¬ 
ized  electricity,  and  we  could  justify  the  use  of  it  so 
long  as  we  see  the  joke  of  it.  But,  in  fact,  we  do  not 
even  see  the  joke  of  the  waterworks  and  the  water 

192 


FREE  MAN  AND  THE  FORD  CAR  193 

company.  It  is  almost  too  broadly  comic  that  an  es¬ 
sential  of  life  like  water  should  be  pumped  to  us  from 
nobody  knows  where,  by  nobody  knows  whom,  some¬ 
times  nearly  a  hundred  miles  away.  It  is  every  bit  as 
funny  as  if  air  were  pumped  to  us  from  miles  away, 
and  we  all  walked  about  like  divers  at  the  bottom 
of  the  sea.  The  only  reasonable  person  is  the  peas¬ 
ant  who  owns  his  own  well.  But  we  have  a  long 
way  to  go  before  we  begin  to  think  about  being  rea¬ 
sonable. 

There  are  at  present  some  examples  of  centraliza¬ 
tion  of  which  the  effects  may  work  for  decentraliza¬ 
tion.  An  obvious  case  is  that  recently  discussed  in 
connection  with  a  common  plant  of  electricity.  I 
think  it  is  broadly  true  that  if  electricity  could  be 
cheapened,  the  chances  of  a  very  large  number  of 
small  independent  shops,  especially  workshops,  would 
be  greatly  improved.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  no 
doubt  at  all  that  such  dependence  for  essential  power 
on  a  central  plant  is  a  real  dependence,  and  is  there¬ 
fore  a  defect  in  any  complete  scheme  of  independ¬ 
ence.  On  this  point  I  imagine  that  many  Distributists 
might  differ  considerably;  but,  speaking  for  myself, 

I  am  inclined  to  follow  the  more  moderate  and  pro¬ 
visional  policy  that  I  have  suggested  more  than  once 
in  this  place.  I  think  the  first  necessity  is  to  make 
sure  of  any  small  properties  obtaining  any  success  in 
any  decisive  or  determining  degree.  Above  all,  I  think 
it  is  vital  to  create  the  experience  of  small  property, 


194  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

the  psychology  of  small  property,  the  sort  of  man 
who  is  a  small  proprietor.  When  once  men  of  that  sort 
exist,  they  will  decide,  in  a  manner  very  different  from 
any  modern  mob,  how  far  the  central  power-house  is 
to  dominate  their  own  private  house,  or  whether  it 
need  dominate  at  all.  They  will  perhaps  discover  the 
way  of  breaking  up  and  individualizing  that  power. 
They  will  sacrifice,  if  there  is  any  need  to  sacrifice, 
even  the  help  of  science  to  the  hunger  for  possession. 
So  that  I  am  disposed  at  the  moment  to  accept  any 
help  that  science  and  machinery  can  give  in  creating 
small  property,  without  in  the  least  bowing  down  to 
such  superstitions  where  they  only  destroy  it.  But  we 
must  keep  in  mind  the  peasant  ideal  as  the  motive 
and  the  goal;  and  most  of  those  who  offer  us  me¬ 
chanical  help  seem  to  be  blankly  ignorant  of  what 
we  regard  it  as  helping.  A  well-known  name  will  illus¬ 
trate  both  the  thing  being  done'  and  the  man  being 
ignorant  of  what  he  is  doing. 

The  other  day  I  found  myself  in  a  Ford  car,  like 
that  in  which  I  remember  riding  over  Palestine,  and 
in  which  (I  suppose)  Mr.  Ford  would  enjoy  riding 
over  Palestinians.  Anyhow,  it  reminded  me  of  Mr. 
Ford,  and  that  reminded  me  of  Mr.  Penty  and  his 
views  upon  equality  and  mechanical  civilization.  The 
Ford  car  (if  I  may  venture  on  one  of  those  new  ideas 
urged  upon  us  in  newspapers)  is  a  typical  product  of 
the  age.  The  best  thing  about  it  is  the  thing  for  which 
it  is  despised;  that  it  is  small.  The  worst  thing  about 


FREE  MAN  AND  THE  FORD  CAR  195 

it  is  the  thing  for  which  it  is  praised;  that  it  is  stand¬ 
ardized.  Its  smallness  is,  of  course,  the  subject  of 
endless  American  jokes,  about  a  man  catching  a  Ford 
like  a  fly  or  possibly  a  flea.  But  nobody  seems  to 
notice  how  this  popularization  of  motoring  (however 
wrong  in  motive  or  in  method)  really  is  a  complete 
contradiction  to  the  fatalistic  talk  about  inevitable 
combination  and  concentration.  The  railway  is  fading 
before  our  eyes — birds  nesting,  as  it  were,  in  the  rail¬ 
way  signals,  and  wolves  howling,  so  to  speak,  in  the 
waiting-room.  And  the  railway  really  was  a  com¬ 
munal  and  concentrated  mode  of  travel  like  that  in 
a  Utopia  of  the  Socialists.  The  free  and  solitary 
traveller  is  returning  before  our  very  eyes;  not  al¬ 
ways  (it  is  true)  equipped  with  scrip  or  scallop,  but 
having  recovered  to  some  extent  the  freedom  of  the 
King’s  highway  in  the  manner  of  Merry  England. 
Nor  is  this  the  only  ancient  thing  such  travel  has 
revived.  While  Mugby  Junction  neglected  its  re¬ 
freshment-rooms,  Hugby-in-the-Hole  has  revived  its 
inns.  To  that  limited  extent  the  Ford  motor  is  al¬ 
ready  a  reversion  to  the  free  man.  If  he  has  not  three 
acres  and  a  cow,  he  has  the  very  inadequate  sub¬ 
stitute  of  three  hundred  miles  and  a  car.  I  do  not 
mean  that  this  development  satisfies  my  theories.  But 
I  do  say  that  it  destroys  other  people’s  theories;  all 
the  theories  about  the  collective  thing  as  a  thing  of 
the  future  and  the  individual  thing  as  a  thing  of  the 
past.  Even  in  their  own  special  and  stinking  way  of 


196  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

science  and  machinery,  the  facts  are  very  largely 
going  against  their  theories. 

!  Yet  I  have  never  seen  Mr.  Ford  and  his  little  car 
really  and  intelligently  praised  for  this.(l  have  often, 
of  course,  seen  him  praised  for  all  the  conveniences 
of  what  is  called  standardization.  The  argument  seems 
to  be  more  or  less  to  this  effect.  When  your  car  breaks 
down  with  a  loud  crash  in  the  middle  of  Salisbury 
Plain,  though  it  is  not  very  likely  that  any  fragments 
of  other  ruined  motor  cars  will  be  lying  about  amid 
the  ruins  of  Stonehenge,  yet  if  they  are,  it  is  a  great 
advantage  to  think  that  they  will  probably  be  of  the 
same  pattern,  and  you  can  take  them  to  mend  your 
own  car.  The  same  principle  applies  to  persons  motor¬ 
ing  in  Tibet,  and  exulting  in  the  reflection  that  if 
another  motorist  from  the  United  States  did  happen 
to  come  along,  it  would  be  possible  to  exchange  wheels 
or  footbrakes  in  token  of  amity.  I  may  not  have  got 
the  details  of  the  argument  quite  correct;  but  the 
general  point  of  it  is  that  if  anything  goes  wrong 
with  parts  of  a  machine,  they  can  be  replaced  with 
identical  machinery.  And  anyhow  the  argument  could 
be  carried  much  further;  and  used  to  explain  a  great 
many  other  things.  I  am  not  sure  that  it  is  not  the 
clue  to  many  mysteries  of  the  age.  I  begin  to  under¬ 
stand,  for  instance,  why  magazine  stories  are  all  ex¬ 
actly  alike;  it  is  ordered  so  that  when  you  have  left 
one  magazine  in  a  railway  carriage  in  the  middle  of 
a  story  called  “Pansy  Eyes,”  you  may  go  on  with 


FREE  MAN  AND  THE  FORD  CAR  197 


exactly  the  same  story  in  another  magazine  under 
the  title  of  “Dandelion  Locks.”  It  explains  why  all 
leading  articles  on  The  Future  of  the  Churches  are 
exactly  the  same;  so  that  we  may  begin  reading  the 
article  in  the  Daily  Chronicle  and  finish  it  in  the 
Daily  Express.  It  explains  why  all  the  public  utter¬ 
ances  urging  us  to  prefer  new  things  to  old  never  by 
any  chance  say  anything  new;  they  mean  that  we 
should  go  to  a  new  paper-stall  and  read  it  in  a  new 
newspaper.  This  is  w'hy  all  American  caricatures  re¬ 
peat  themselves  like  a  mathematical  pattern;  it  means 
that  when  we  have  torn  off  a  part  of  the  picture  to 
wrap  up  sandwiches,  we  can  tear  off  a  bit  of  an¬ 
other  picture  and  it  will  always  fit  in.  And  this  is  also 
why  American  millionaires  all  look  exactly  alike;  so 
that  when  the  bright,  resolute  expression  of  one  of 
them  has  led  us  to  do  serious  damage  to  his  face  with 
a  heavy  blow  of  the  fist,  it  is  always  possible  to  mend 
it  with  noses  and  jaw-bones  taken  from  other  million¬ 
aires,  who  are  exactly  similarly  constituted. 

Such  are  the  advantages  of  standardization;  but, 
as  may  be  suspected,  I  think  the  advantages  are 
exaggerated;  and  I  agree  with  Mr.  Penty  in  doubt¬ 
ing  whether  all  this  repetition  really  corresponds  to 
human  nature.  But  a  very  interesting  question  was 
raised  by  Mr.  Ford’s  remarks  on  the  difference  be¬ 
tween  men  and  men;  and  his  suggestion  that  most 
men  preferred  mechanical  action  or  were  only  fitted 
for  it.  About  all  those  arguments  affecting  human 


198  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

equality,  I  myself  always  have  one  feeling,  which 
finds  expression  in  a  little  test  of  my  own.  I  shall  be¬ 
gin  to  take  seriously  those  classifications  of  superior¬ 
ity  and  inferiority,  when  I  find  a  man  classifying 
himself  as  inferior.  It  will  be  noted  that  Mr.  Ford 
does  not  say  that  be  is  only  fitted  to  mind  machines; 
he  confesses  frankly  that  he  is  too  fine  and  free  and 
fastidious  a  being  for  such  tasks.  I  shall  believe  the 
doctrine  when  I  hear  somebody  say:  “I  have  only 
got  the  wits  to  turn  a  wheel."  That  would  be  real,  that 
would  be  realistic,  that  would  be  scientific.  That 
would  be  independent  testimony  that  could  not  easily 
be  disputed.  It  is  exactly  the  same,  of  course,  with 
all  the  other  superiorities  and  denials  of  human  equal¬ 
ity  that  are  so  specially  characteristic  of  a  scien¬ 
tific  age.  It  is  so  with  the  men  who  talk  about  superior 
and  inferior  races;  I  never  heard  a  man  say:  "An¬ 
thropology  shows  that  I  belong  to  an  inferior  race." 
If  he  did,  he  might  be  talking  like  an  anthropologist; 
as  it  is,  he  is  talking  like  a  man,  and  not  unfrequently 
like  a  fool.  I  have  long  hoped  that  I  might  some  day 
hear  a  man  explaining  on  scientific  principles  his  own 
unfitness  for  any  important  post  or  privilege,  say: 
"The  world  should  belong  to  the  free  and  fighting 
races,  and  not  to  persons  of  that  servile  disposition 
that  you  will  notice  in  myself;  the  intelligent  will 
know  how  to  form  opinions,  but  the  weakness  of  in¬ 
tellect  from  which  I  so  obviously  suffer  renders  my 
opinions  manifestly  absurd  on  the  face  of  them: 


FREE  MAN  AND  THE  FORD  CAR  199 

there  are  indeed  stately  and  godlike  races — but  look 
at  me!  Observe  my  shapeless  and  fourth-rate  fea¬ 
tures!  Gaze,  if  you  can  bear  it,  on  my  commonplace 
and  repulsive  face!”  If  I  heard  a  man  making  a 
scientific  demonstration  in  that  style,  I  might  admit 
that  he  was  really  scientific.  But  as  it  invariably  hap¬ 
pens,  by  a  curious  coincidence,  that  the  superior  race 
is  his  own  race,  the  superior  type  is  his  own  type, 
and  the  superior  preference  for  work  the  sort  of  work 
he  happens  to  prefer — I  have  come  to  the  conclusion 
that  there  is  a  simpler  explanation. 

Now  Mr.  Ford  is  a  good  man,  so  far  as  it  is  con¬ 
sistent  with  being  a  good  millionaire.  But  he  himself 
will  very  well  illustrate  where  the  fallacy  of  his  ar¬ 
gument  lies.  It  is  probably  quite  true  that,  in  the 
making  of  motors,  there  are  a  hundred  men  who  can 
work  a  motor  and  only  one  man  who  can  design  a 
motor.  But  of  the  hundred  men  who  could  work 
a  motor,  it  is  very  probable  that  one  could  design  a 
garden,  another  design  a  charade,  another  design  a 
practical  joke  or  a  derisive  picture  of  Mr.  Ford.  I 
do  not  mean,  of  course,  in  anything  I  say  here,  to 
deny  differences  of  intelligence,  or  to  suggest  that 
equality  (a  thing  wholly  religious)  depends  on  any 
such  impossible  denial.  But  I  do  mean  that  men  are 
nearer  to  a  level  than  anybody  will  discover  by  set¬ 
ting  them  all  to  make  one  particular  kind  of  run¬ 
about  clock.  Now  Mr.  Ford  himself  is  a  man  of  de¬ 
fiant  limitations.  He  is  so  indifferent  to  history,  for 


200  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

example,  that  he  calmly  admitted  in  the  witness-box 
that  he  had  never  heard  of  Benedict  Arnold.  An 
American  who  has  never  heard  of  Benedict  Arnold 
is  like  a  Christian  who  has  never  heard  of  Judas 
Iscariot.  He  is  rare.  I  believe  that  Mr.  Ford  indicated 
in  a  general  way  that  he  thought  Benedict  Arnold 
was  the  same  as  Arnold  Bennett.  Not  only  is  this  not 
the  case,  but  it  is  an  error  to  suppose  that  there  is 
no  importance  in  such  an  error.  If  he  were  to  find  him¬ 
self,  in  the  heat  of  some  controversy,  accusing  Mr. 
Arnold  Bennett  of  having  betrayed  the  American 
President  and  ravaged  the  South  with  an  Anti- 
American  army,  Mr.  Bennett  might  bring  an  action. 
If  Mr.  Ford  were  to  suppose  that  the  lady  who  re¬ 
cently  wrote  revelations  in  the  Daily  Express  was 
old  enough  to  be  the  widow  of  Benedict  Arnold,  the 
lady  might  bring  an  action.  Now  it  is  not  impossible 
that  among  the  workmen  whom  Mr.  Ford  perceives 
(probably  quite  truly)  to  be  only  suited  to  the 
mechanical  part  of  the  construction  of  mechanical 
things,  there  might  be  a  man  who  was  fond  of  reading 
all  the  history  he  could  lay  his  hands  on;  and  who 
had  advanced  step  by  step,  by  painful  efforts  of  self- 
education,  until  the  difference  between  Benedict  Ar¬ 
nold  and  Arnold  Bennett  was  quite  clear  in  his  mind. 
If  his  employer  did  not  care  about  the  difference,  of 
course,  he  would  not  consult  him  about  the  difference, 
and  the  man  would  remain  to  all  appearance  a  mere 
cog  in  the  machine;  there  would  be  no  reason  for 


FREE  MAN  AND  THE  FORD  CAR  201 


finding  out  that  he  was  a  rather  cogitating  cog.  Any¬ 
body  who  knows  anything  of  modern  business  knows 
that  there  are  any  number  of  such  men  who  remain  in 
subordinate  and  obscure  positions  because  their  pri¬ 
vate  tastes  and  talents  have  no  relation  to  the  very 
stupid  business  in  which  they  are  engaged.  If  Mr. 
Ford  extends  his  business  over  the  Solar  System,  and 
gives  cars  to  the  Martians  and  the  Man  in  the  Moon, 
he  will  not  be  an  inch  nearer  to  the  mind  of  the  man 
who  is  working  his  machine  for  him,  and  thinking 
about  something  more  sensible.  Now  all  human  things 
are  imperfect;  but  the  condition  in  which  such  hob¬ 
bies  and  secondary  talents  do  to  some  extent  come  out 
is  the  condition  of  small  independence.  The  peas¬ 
ant  almost  always  runs  two  or  three  sideshows  and 
lives  on  a  variety  of  crafts  and  expedients.  The  vil¬ 
lage  shopkeeper  will  shave  travellers  and  stuff  weasels 
and  grow  cabbages  and  do  half  a  dozen  such  things, 
keeping  a  sort  of  balance  in  his  life  like  the  balance  of 
sanity  in  the  soul.  The  method  is  not  perfect;  but  it 
is  more  intelligent  than  turning  him  into  a  machine 
in  order  to  find  out  whether  he  has  a  soul  above 
machinery. 

Upon  this  point  of  immediate  compromise  with 
machinery,  therefore,  I  am  inclined  to  conclude  that 
it  is  quite  right  to  use  the  existing  machines  in  so 
far  as  they  do  create  a  psychology  that  can  despise 
machines;  but  not  if  they  create  a  psychology  that 
respects  them.  The  Ford  car  is  an  excellent  illustra-

tion  of  the  question;  even  better  than  the  other  illus¬ 
tration  I  have  given  of  an  electrical  supply  for  small 
workshops.  If  possessing  a  Ford  car  means  rejoicing 
in  a  Ford  car,  it  is  melancholy  enough;  it  does  not 
bring  us  much  farther  than  Tooting  or  rejoicing  in  a 
Tooting  tramcar.  But  if  possessing  a  Ford  car  means 
rejoicing  in  a  field  of  corn  or  clover,  in  a  fresh  land¬ 
scape  and  a  free  atmosphere,  it  may  be  the  beginning 
of  many  things — and  even  the  end  of  many  things. 
It  may  be,  for  instance,  the  end  of  the  car  and  the 
beginning  of  the  cottage.  Thus  we  might  almost  say 
that  the  final  triumph  of  Mr.  Ford  is  not  when  the 
man  gets  into  the  car,  but  when  he  enthusiastically 
falls  out  of  the  car.  It  is  when  he  finds  somewhere,  in 
remote  and  rural  corners  that  he  could  not  normally 
have  reached,  that  perfect  poise  and  combination  of 
hedge  and  tree  and  meadow  in  the  presence  of  which 
any  modern  machine  seems  suddenly  to  look  an  ab¬ 
surdity;  yes,  even  an  antiquated  absurdity.  Probably 
that  happy  man,  having  found  the  place  of  his  true 
home,  will  proceed  joyfully  to  break  up  the  car  with 
a  large  hammer,  putting  its  iron  fragments  for  the 
first  time  to  some  real  use,-  as  kitchen  utensils  or 
garden  tools.  That  is  using  a  scientific  instrument  in 
the  proper  way;  for  it  is  using  it  as  an  instrument. 
The  man  has  used  modern  machinery  to  escape  from 
modern  society ;  and  the  reason  and  rectitude  of  such 
a  course  commends  itself  instantly  to  the  mind.  It  is 


FREE  MAN  AND  THE  FORD  CAR  203 


not  so  with  the  weaker  brethren  who  are  not  content 
to  trust  Mr.  Ford’s  car,  bu-t  also  trust  Mr.  Ford’s 
creed.  If  accepting  the  car  means  accepting  the  phi¬ 
losophy  I  have  just  criticized,  the  notion  that  some 
men  are  born  to  make  cars,  or  rather  small  bits  of 
cars,  then  it  will  be  far  more  worthy  of  a  philosopher 
to  say  frankly  that  men  never  needed  to  have  cars 
at  all.  It  is  only  because  the  man  had  been  sent  into 
exile  in  a  railway-train  that  he  has  to  be  brought 
back  home  in  a  motor-car.  It  is  only  because  all 
machinery  has  been  used  to  put  things  wrong  that 
some  machinery  may  now  rightly  be  used  to  put 
things  right.  But  I  conclude  upon  the  whole  that  it 
may  so  be  used;  and  my  reason  is  that  which  I  con¬ 
sidered  on  a  previous  page  under  the  heading  of 
“The  Chance  of  Recovery.”  I  pointed  out  that  our 
ideal  is  so  sane  and  simple,  so  much  in  accord  with  the 
ancient  and  general  instincts  of  men,  that  when  once 
it  is  given  a  chance  anywhere  it  will  improve  that 
chance  by  its  own  inner  vitality  because  there  is  some 
reaction  towards  health  whenever  disease  is  removed. 
The  man  who  has  used  his  car  to  find  his  farm  will 
be  more  interested  in  the  farm  than  in  the  car;  cer¬ 
tainly  more  interested  than  in  the  shop  where  he  once 
bought  the  car.  Nor  -will  Mr.  Ford  always  woo  him 
back  to  that  shop,  even  by  telling  him  tenderly  that 
he  is  not  fitted  to  be  a  lord  of  land,  a  rider  of  horses, 
or  a  ruler  of  cattle;  since  his  deficient  intellect  and 


204  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

degraded  anthropological  type  fit  him  only  for  mean 
and  mechanical  operations.  If  anyone  will  try  saying 
this  (tenderly,  of  course)  to  any  considerable  number 
of  large  farmers,  who  have  lived  for  some  time  on 
their  own  farms  with  their  own  families,  he  will  dis¬ 
cover  the  defects  of  the  approach.

THE  NEED  OF  A  NEW  SPIRIT 


Before  closing  these  notes,  with  some  words  on  the 
colonial  aspect  of  democratic  distribution,  it  will  be 
well  to  make  some  acknowledgment  of  the  recent  sug¬ 
gestion  of  so  distinguished  a  man  as  Mr.  John  Gals¬ 
worthy.  Mr.  Galsworthy  is  a  man  for  whom  I  have 
the  very  warmest  regard;  for  a  human  being  who 
really  tries  to  be  fair  is  something  very  like  a  mon¬ 
ster  and  miracle  in  the  long  history  of  this  merry 
race  of  ours.  Sometimes,  indeed,  I  get  a  little  exas¬ 
perated  at  being  so  persistently  excused.  I  can  imagine 
few  things  more  annoying,  to  a  free-born  and  properly 
constituted  Christian,  than  the  thought  that  if  he 
did  choose  to  wait  for  Mr.  Galsworthy  behind  a  wall, 
knock  him  down  with  a  brick,  jump  on  him  with 
heavy  boots,  and  so  on,  Mr.  Galsworthy  would  still 
faintly  gasp  that  it  was  only  the  fault  of  the  System; 
that  the  System  made  bricks  and  the  System  heaved 
bricks  and  the  System  went  about  wearing  heavy 
boots,  and  so  on.  As  a  human  being,  I  should  feel  a 
longing  for  a  little  human  justice,  after  all  that  in¬ 
human  mercy. 

But  these  feelings  do  not  interfere  with  the  other 
feelings  I  have,  of  something  like  enthusiasm  for 

207 


208  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

something  that  can  only  be  called  beautiful  in  the 
fair-mindedness  of  a  study  like  “The  White  Mon¬ 
key."  It  is  when  this  attitude  of  detachment  is  ap¬ 
plied  not  to  the  judgment  of  individuals  but  of  men 
in  bulk,  that  the  detachment  begins  to  savour  of 
something  unnatural.  And  in  Mr.  Galsworthy’s  last 
political  pronouncement  the  detachment  amounts  to 
despair.  At  any  rate,  it  amounts  to  despair  about  this 
earth,  this  England,  about  which  I  am  certainly  not 
going  to  despair  yet.  But  I  think  it  might  be  well  if 
I  took  this  opportunity  of  stating  what  I,  for  one, 
at  least  feel  about  the  different  claims  here  involved. 

It  may  be  debated  whether  it  is  a  good  or  a  bad 
thing  for  England  that  England  has  an  Empire.  It 
may  be  debated,  at  least  as  a  matter  of  true  definition, 
whether  England  has  an  Empire  at  all.  But  upon 
one  point  all  Englishmen  ought  to  stand  firm,  as  a 
matter  of  history,  of  philosophy,  and  of  logic.  And 
that  is  that  it  has  been,  and  is,  a  question  of  our  own¬ 
ing  an  Empire  and  not  of  an  Empire  owning  us. 

There  is  sense  in  being  separated  from  Americans 
on  the  principles  of  George  Washington,  and  sense 
in  being  attached  to  Americans  on  the  principles  of 
George  the  Third.  But  there  is  no  sense  in  being  out¬ 
voted  and  swamped  by  Americans  in  the  name  of  the 
Anglo-Saxon  race.  The  Colonies  were  by  origin  Eng¬ 
lish.  They  owe  us  that  much;  if  it  be  only  the  trivial 
circumstance,  so  little  valued  by  modern  thought,  that 
without  their  maker  they  could  never  have  existed  at 


THE  NEED  OF  A  NEW  SPIRIT  209 

all.  If  they  choose  to  remain  English,  we  thank  them 
very  sincerely  for  the  compliment.  If  they  choose  not 
to  remain  English,  but  to  turn  into  something  else, 
we  think  they  are  within  their  rights.  But  anyhow 
England  shall  remain  English.  They  shall  not  first 
turn  themselves  into  something  else,  and  then  turn 
us  into  themselves.  It  may  have  been  wrong  to  be 
an  Empire,  but  it  does  not  rob  us  of  our  right  to  be 
a  nation. 

But  there  is  another  sense  in  which  those  of  our 
school  would  use  the  motto  of  “England  First.”  It 
is  in  the  sense  that  our  first  step  should  be  to  dis¬ 
cover  how  far  the  best  ethical  and  economic  system 
can  be  fitted  into  England,  before  we  treat  it  as  an 
export  and  cart  it  away  to  the  ends  of  the  earth.  The 
scientific  or  commercial  character,  who  is  sure  he  has 
found  an  explosive  that  will  blow  up  the  solar  system 
or  a  bullet  that  will  kill  the  man  in  the  moon,  always 
makes  a  great  parade  of  saying  that  he  offers  it  first 
to  his  own  country,  and  only  afterwards  to  a  foreign 
country.  Personally,  I  cannot  conceive  how  a  man 
can  bring  himself  in  any  case  to  offer  such  a  thing  to 
a  foreign  country.  But  then  I  am  not  a  great  scientific 
and  commercial  genius.  Anyhow,  such  as  our  little 
notion  of  normal  ownership  is,  we  certainly  do  not 
propose  to  offer  it  to  any  foreign  country,  or  even  to 
any  colony,  before  we  offer  it  to  our  own  country. 
And  we  do  think  it  highly  urgent  and  practical  to 
find  out  first  how  much  of  it  can  really  be  carried  out 


210  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

in  our  own  country.  Nobody  supposes  that  the  whole 
English  population  could  live  on  the  English  land. 
But  everybody  ought  to  realize  that  immeasurably 
more  people  could  live  on  it  than  do  live  on  it;  and 
that  if  such  a  policy  did  establish  such  a  peasantry, 
there  would  be  a  recognizable  narrowing  of  the  mar¬ 
gin  of  men  left  over  for  the  town  and  the  colonies. 
But  we  would  suggest  that  these  ought  really  to  be 
left  over,  and  dealt  with  as  seems  most  desirable, 
after  the  main  experiment  has  been  made  where  it 
matters  most.  And  what  most  of  us  would  complain 
of  in  the  emigrationists  of  the  ordinary  sort  is  that 
they  seem  to  think  first  of  the  colony  and  then  of 
what  must  be  left  behind  in  the  country;  instead  of 
thinking  first  of  the  country  and  then  of  what  must 
overflow  into  the  colony. 

People  talk  about  an  optimist  being  in  a  hurry; 
but  it  seems  to  me  that  a  pessimist  like  Mr.  Gals¬ 
worthy  is  very  much  in  a  hurry.  He  has  not  tried  the 
obvious  reform  on  England,  and,  finding  it  fail,  gone 
into  exile  to  try  it  elsewhere.  iHe  is  trying  the  obvious 
reform  everywhere  except  where  it  is  most  obvious. 
And  in  this  I  think  he  has  a  subconscious  affinity  to 
people  much  less  reasonable  and  respectable  than 
himself.  The  pessimists  have  a  curious  way  of  urging 
us  to  counsels  of  despair  as  the  only  solution  of  a 
problem  they  have  not  troubled  to  solve.  They  de¬ 
clare  solemnly  that  some  unnatural  thing  would  be¬ 
come  necessary  if  certain  conditions  existed;  and  then 


THE  NEED  OF  A  NEW  SPIRIT  211 

somehow  assume  from  that  that  they  exist.  They 
never  think  of  attempting  to  prove  that  they  exist, 
before  they  prove  what  follows  from  their  existence. 
This  is  exactly  the  sort  of  plunging  and  premature 
pessimism,  for  instance,  that  people  exhibit  about 
Birth  Control.  Their  desire  is  towards  destruction; 
their  hope  is  for  despair;  they  eagerly  anticipate  the 
darkest  and  most  doubtful  predictions.  They  run 
with  eager  feet  before  and  beyond  the  lingering  and 
inconveniently  slow  statistics;  like  as  the  hart  pants 
for  the  water-brooks  they  thirst  to  drink  of  Styx  and 
Lethe  before  their  hour;  even  the  facts  they  show 
fall  far  short  of  the  faith  that  they  see  shining  be¬ 
yond  them;  for  faith  is  the  substance  of  things  hoped 
for,  the  evidence  of  things  not  seen. 

If  I  do  not  compare  the  critic  in  question  with 
the  doctors  of  this  dismal  perversion,  still  less  do  I 
compare  him  with  those  whose  motives  are  merely 
self-protective  and  plutocratic.  But  it  must  also  be 
said  that  many  rush  to  the  expedient  of  emigra¬ 
tion,  just  as  many  rush  to  the  expedient  of  Birth 
Control,  for  the  perfectly  simple  reason  that  it  is 
the  easiest  way  in  which  the  capitalists  can  escape 
from  their  own  blunder  of  capitalism.  They  lured 
men  into  the  town  with  the  promise  of  greater  pleas¬ 
ures;  they  ruined  them  there  and  left  them  with  only 
one  pleasure;  they  found  the  increase  it  produced  at 
first  convenient  for  labour  and  then  inconvenient  for 
supply;  and  now  they  are  ready  to  round  off  their 


212  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

experiment  in  a  highly  appropriate  manner,  by  telling 
them  that  they  must  have  no  families,  or  that  their 
families  must  go  to  the  modern  equivalent  of  Botany 
Bay.  It  is  not  in  that  spirit  that  we  envisage  an  ele¬ 
ment  of  colonization;  and  so  long  as  it  is  treated  in 
that  spirit  we  refuse  to  consider  it.  I  put  first  the 
statement  that  real  colonial  settlement  must  be  not 
only  stable  but  sacred.  I  say  the  new  home  must  be 
not  only  a  home  but  a  shrine.  And  that  is  why  I  say 
it  must  be  first  established  in  England,  in  the  home 
of  our  fathers  and  the  shrine  of  our  saints,  to  be  a 
light  and  an  ensign  to  our  children. 

I  have  explained  that  I  cannot  content  myself 
with  leaving  my  own  nationality  out  of  my  own  nor¬ 
mal  ideal;  or  leaving  England  as  the  mere  tool- 
house  or  coal-cellar  of  other  countries  like  Canada  or 
Australia — or,  for  that  matter,  Argentina.  I  should 
like  England  also  to  have  a  much  more  rural  type 
of  redistribution;  nor  do  I  think  it  impossible.  But 
when  this  is  allowed  for,  nobody  in  his  five  wits  would 
dream  of  denying  that  there  is  a  real  scope  and  even 
necessity  for  emigration  and  colonial  settlement. 
Only,  when  we  come  to  that,  I  have  to  draw  a  line 
rather  sharply  and  explain  something  else,  which  is 
by  no  means  inconsistent  with  my  love  of  England, 
but  I  fear  is  not  so  likely  to  make  me  loved  by 
Englishmen.  I  do  not  believe,  as  the  newspapers  and 
national  histories  always  tell  me  to  believe,  that  we 
have  the  secret  of  this  sort  of  successful  coloniza- 


THE  NEED  OF  A  NEW  SPIRIT  213 

tion  and  need  nothing  else  to  achieve  this  sort  of 
democratic  social  construction.  I  ask  for  nothing  bet¬ 
ter  than  that  a  man  should  be  English  in  England. 
But  I  think  he  will  have  to  be  something  more  than 
English  (or  at  any  rate  something  more  than  “Brit¬ 
ish  )  if  he  is  to  create  a  solid  social  equality  out¬ 
side  England.  For  something  is  needed  for  that  solid 
social  creation  which  our  colonial  tradition  has  not 
given.  Aly  reasons  for  holding  this  highly  unpopular 
opinion  I  will  attempt  to  suggest;  but  the  fact  that 
they  are  rather  difficult  to  suggest  is  itself  an  evidence 
of  their  unfamiliarity  and  of  that  narrowness  which 
is  neither  national  nor  international,  but  only  im¬ 
perial. 

I  should  very  much  like  to  be  present  at  a  con¬ 
versation  between  Mr.  Saklatvala  and  Dean  Inge.  I 
have  a  great  deal  of  respect  for  the  real  sincerity  of 
the  Dean  of  St.  Paul  s,  but  his  subconscious  prejudices 
are  of  a  strange  sort.  I  cannot  help  having  a  feeling 
that  he  might  have  a  certain  sympathy  with  a  Social¬ 
ist  so  long  as  he  was  not  a  Christian  Socialist.  I  do 
not  indeed  pretend  to  any  respect  for  the  ordinary 
sort  of  broad-mindedness  which  is  ready  to  embrace 
a  Buddhist  but  draws  the  line  at  a  Bolshevist.  I  think 
its  significance  is  very  simple.  It  means  welcoming 
alien  religions  when  they  make  us  feel  comfortable, 
and  persecuting  them  when  they  make  us  feel  un¬ 
comfortable.  But  the  particular  reason  I  have  at  the 
moment  for  entertaining  this  association  of  ideas  is 


214  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

one  that  concerns  a  larger  matter.  It  concerns,  in¬ 
deed,  what  is  commonly  called  the  British  Empire, 
which  we  were  once  taught  to  reverence  largely  be¬ 
cause  it  was  large.  And  one  of  my  complaints  against 
that  common  and  rather  vulgar  sort  of  imperialism  is 
that  it  did  not  really  secure  even  the  advantages  of 
largeness.  As  I  have  said,  I  am  a  nationalist;  Eng¬ 
land  is  good  enough  for  me.  I  would  defend  England 
against  the  whole  European  continent.  With  even 
greater  joy  would  I  defend  England  against  the 
whole  British  Empire.  With  a  romantic  rapture  would 
I  defend  England  against  Mr.  Ramsay  MacDonald 
when  he  had  become  King  of  Scotland;  lighting 
again  the  watch  fires  of  Newark  and  Carlisle  and 
sounding  the  old  tocsins  of  the  Border.  With  equal 
energy  would  I  defend  England  against  Mr.  Tim 
Healy  as  King  of  Ireland,  if  ever  the  gross  and  grow¬ 
ing  prosperity  of  that  helpless  and  decaying  Celtic 
stock  became  positively  offensive.  With  the  greatest 
ecstasy  of  all  would  I  defend  England  against  Mr. 
Lloyd  George  as  King  of  Wales.  It  will  be  seen, 
therefore,  that  there  is  nothing  broad-minded  about 
my  patriotism;  most  modern  nationality  is  not  nar¬ 
row  enough  for  me. 

But  putting  aside  my  own  local  affections,  and 
looking  at  the  matter  in  what  is  called  a  larger  way, 
I  note  once  more  that  our  Imperialism  does  not  get 
any  of  the  good  that  could  be  got  out  of  being  large. 
And  I  was  reminded  of  Dean  Inge,  because  he  sug- 


THE  NEED  OF  A  NEW  SPIRIT  215 

gested  some  time  ago  that  the  Irish  and  the  French 
Canadians  were  increasing  in  numbers,  not  because 
they  held  the  Catholic  view  of  the  family,  but  because 
they  were  a  backward  and  apparently  almost  barbaric 
stock  which  naturally  (I  suppose  he  meant)  in¬ 
creased  with  the  blind  luxuriance  of  a  jungle.  I  have 
already  remarked  on  the  amusing  trick  of  having  it 
both  ways  which  is  illustrated  in  this  remark.  So 
long  as  savages  are  dying  out,  we  say  they  are  dying 
out  because  they  are  savages.  When  they  are  incon¬ 
veniently  increasing,  we  say  they  are  increasing  be¬ 
cause  they  are  savages.  And  from  this  it  is  but  a 
simple  logical  step  to  say  that  the  countrymen  of  Sir 
Will  red  Laurier  or  Senator  Yeats  are  savages  because 
they  are  increasing.  But  what  strikes  me  most  about 
the  situation  is  this:  that  this  spirit  will  always  miss 
what  is  really  to  be  learnt  by  covering  any  large 
and  varied  area.  If  French  Canada  is  really  a  part  of 
the  British  Empire,  it  would  seem  that  the  Empire 
might  at  least  have  served  as  a  sort  of  interpreter 
between  the  British  and  the  French.  The  Imperial 
statesman,  if  he  had  really  been  a  statesman,  ought 
to  have  been  able  to  say,  “It  is  always  difficult  to 
understand  another  nation  or  another  religion;  but  I 
am  more  fortunately  placed  than  most  people.  I  know 
a  little  more  than  can  be  known  by  self-contained 
and  isolated  states  like  Sweden  or  Spain.  I  have  more 
sympathy  with  the  Catholic  faith  or  the  French  blood 
because  I  have  French  Catholics  in  my  own  Empire.” 


216  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

Now  it  seems  to  me  that  the  Imperial  statesman 
never  has  said  this;  never  has  even  been  able  to  say 
it;  never  has  even  tried  or  pretended  to  be  able  to 
say  it.  He  has  been  far  narrower  than  a  nationalist 
like  myself,  engaged  in  desperately  defending  Offa’s 
Dyke  against  a  horde  of  Welsh  politicians.  I  doubt 
if  there  was  ever  a  politician  who  knew  a  word  more 
of  the  French  language,  let  alone  a  word  more  of  the 
Latin  Mass,  because  he  had  to  govern  a  whole  popu¬ 
lation  that  drew  its  traditions  from  Rome  and  Gaul. 
I  will  suggest  in  a  moment  how  this  enormous  inter¬ 
national  narrowness  affects  the  question  of  a  peas¬ 
antry  and  the  extension  of  the  natural  ownership  of 
land.  But  for  the  moment  it  is  important  to  make  the 
point  clear  about  the  nature  of  that  narrowness.  And 
that  is  why  some  light  might  be  thrown  on  it  in  that 
tender,  that  intimate,  that  heart-to-heart  talk  between 
Mr.  Saklatvala  and  the  Dean  of  St.  Paul’s.  Mr.  Sak- 
latvala  is  a  sort  of  parody  or  extreme  and  extrava¬ 
gant  exhibition  of  the  point;  that  we  really  know 
nothing  at  all  about  the  moral  and  philosophical  ele¬ 
ments  that  make  up  the  Empire.  It  is  quite  obvious, 
of  course,  that  he  does  not  represent  Battersea.  But 
have  we  any  way  of  knowing  to  what  extent  he  repre¬ 
sents  India?  It  seems  to  me  not  impossible  that  the 
more  impersonal  and  indefinite  doctrines  of  Asia  do 
form  a  soil  for  Bolshevism.  Most  of  the  eastern  phi¬ 
losophy  differs  from  the  western  theology  in  refusing 
to  draw  the  line  anywhere;  and  it  would  be  a  highly

probable  perversion  of  that  instinct  to  refuse  to  draw 
the  line  between  meum  and  tuum.  I  do  not  think  the 
Indian  gentleman  is  any  judge  of  whether  we  in  the 
West  want  to  have  a  hedge  round  our  fields  or  a 
wall  round  our  gardens.  And  as  I  happen  to  hold  that 
the  very  highest  human  thought  and  art  consists  al¬ 
most  entirely  in  drawing  the  line  somewhere,  though 
not  in  drawing  it  anywhere,  I  am  completely  con¬ 
fident  that  in  this  the  western  tendency  is  right  and 
the  eastern  tendency  is  wrong.  But,  in  any  case,  it 
seems  to  me  that  a  rather  sharp  lesson  to  us  is  in¬ 
dicated  in  these  two  parallel  cases  of  the  Indian  who 
grows  into  a  Bolshevist  in  our  dominions  without 
our  being  able  to  influence  his  growth,  and  the  French 
Canadian  who  remains  a  peasant  in  our  dominions 
without  our  getting  any  sort  of  advantage  out  of  his 
stability. 

I  do  not  profess  to  know  very  much  about  the 
French  Canadians;  but  I  know  enough  to  know  that 
most  of  the  people  who  talk  at  large  about  the  Em¬ 
pire  know  even  less  than  I  do.  And  the  point  about 
them  is  that  they  generally  do  not  even  try  to  know 
any  more.  The  very  vague  picture  that  they  always 
call  up,  of  colonists  doing  wonders  in  all  the  corners 
of  the  world,  never  does,  in  fact,  include  the  sort  of 
thing  that  French  Canadians  can  do,  or  might  pos¬ 
sibly  show  other  people  how  to  do.  There  is  about  all 
this  fashionable  fancy  of  colonization  a  very  danger¬ 
ous  sort  of  hypocrisy.  People  tried  to  use  the  Over- 


218  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

seas  Dominion  as  Eldorado  while  still  using  it  as 
Botany  Bay.  They  sent  away  people  that  they 
wanted  to  get  rid  of,  and  then  added  insult  to  injury 
by  representing  that  the  ends  of  the  earth  would  be 
delighted  to  have  them.  And  they  called  up  a  sort  of 
fancy  portrait  of  a  person  whose  virtues  and  even 
vices  were  entirely  suitable  for  founding  an  Empire, 
though  apparently  quite  unsuitable  for  founding  a 
family.  The  very  language  they  used  was  misleading. 
They  talked  of  such  people  as  settlers;  but  the  very 
last  thing  they  ever  expected  them  to  do  was  to  settle. 
They  expected  of  them  a  sort  of  indistinct  individual¬ 
istic  breaking  of  new  ground,  for  which  the  world  is 
less  and  less  really  concerned  to-day.  They  sent  an 
inconvenient  nephew  to  hunt  wild  bisons  in  the  streets 
of  Toronto;  just  as  they  had  sent  any  number  of 
irrepressible  Irish  exiles  to  war  with  wild  Redskins 
in  the  streets  of  New  York.  They  incessantly  repeated 
that  what  the  world  wants  is  pioneers,  and  had  never 
even  heard  that  what  the  world  wants  is  peasants. 
There  was  a  certain  amount  of  sincere  and  natural 
sentiment  about  the  wandering  exile  inheriting  our 
traditions.  There  was  really  no  pretence  that  he  was 
engaged  in  founding  his  own  traditions.  All  the  ideas 
that  go  with  a  secure  social  standing  were  absent 
from  the  very  discussion;  no  one  thought  of  the  con¬ 
tinuity,  the  customs,  the  religion,  or  the  folklore  of 
the  future  colonist.  Above  all,  nobody  ever  conceived 
him  as  having  any  strong  sense  of  private  property. 


THE  NEED  OF  A  NEW  SPIRIT  219 

There  was  in  the  vague  idea  of  his  gaining  something 
for  the  Empire  always,  if  anything,  the  idea  of  his 
gaining  what  belonged  to  somebody  else.  I  am  not 
now  discussing  how  wrong  it  was  or  whether  it  could 
in  some  cases  be  right;  I  am  pointing  out  that  no¬ 
body  ever  entertained  the  notion  of  the  other  sort  of 
right;  the  special  right  of  every  man  to  his  own.  I 
doubt  whether  a  word  could  be  quoted  emphasizing 
it  even  from  the  healthiest  adventure  story  or  the 
jolliest  Jingo  song.  I  quite  appreciate  all  there  is  in 
such  songs  or  stories  that  is  really  healthy  or  jolly. 
I  am  only  pointing  out  that  we  have  badly  neglected 
something;  and  are  now  suffering  from  the  neglect. 
And  the  worst  aspect  of  the  neglect  was  that  we  learnt 
nothing  whatever  from  the  peoples  that  were  actually 
inside  the  Empire  which  we  wished  to  glorify:  noth¬ 
ing  whatever  from  the  Irish;  nothing  whatever  from 
the  French  Canadian;  nothing  whatever  even  from 
the  poor  Hindoos.  We  have  now  reached  a  crisis  in 
which  we  particularly  require  these  neglected  talents; 
and  we  do  not  even  know  how  to  set  about  learning 
them.  And  the  explanation  of  this  blunder,  as  of  most 
blunders,  is  in  the  weakness  which  is  called  pride: 
in  other  words,  it  is  in  the  tone  taken  by  people  like 
the  Dean  of  St.  Paul’s. 

Now  there  will  be  needed  a  large  element  of  emi¬ 
gration  in  the  solution  of  re-creating  a  peasantry  in 
the  modern  world.  I  shall  have  more  to  say  about 
the  elements  of  the  idea  in  the  next  section.  But  I 


220  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

believe  that  any  scheme  of  the  sort  will  have  to  be 
based  on  a  totally  different  and  indeed  diametrically 
opposite  spirit  and  principle  to  that  which  is  com¬ 
monly  applied  to  emigration  in  England  to-day.  I 
think  we  need  a  new  sort  of  inspiration,  a  new  sort 
of  appeal,  a  new  sort  of  ordinary  language  even,  be¬ 
fore  that  solution  will  even  help  to  solve  anything. 
What  we  need  is  the  ideal  of  Property,  not  merely  of 
Progress — especially  progress  over  other  people's 
property.  Utopia  needs  more  frontiers,  not  less.  And 
it  is  because  we  were  weak  in  the  ethics  of  property  on 
the  edges  of  Empire  that  our  own  society  will  not 
defend  property  as  men  defend  a  right.  The  Bol¬ 
shevist  is  the  sequel  and  punishment  of  the  Buccaneer. 


II 


THE  RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY 

We  hear  a  great  deal  nowadays  about  the  disad¬ 
vantages  of  decorum,  especially  from  those  who  are 
always  telling  us  that  women  in  the  last  generation 
were  helpless  and  impotent,  and  then  proceed  to 
prove  it  by  describing  the  tremendous  and  towering 
tyranny  of  Mrs.  Grundy.  Rather  in  the  same  way, 
they  insist  that  Victorian  women  were  especially  soft 
and  submissive.  And  it  is  rather  unfortunate  for 
them  that,  even  in  order  to  say  so,  they  have  to  in¬ 
troduce  the  name  of  Queen  Victoria.  But  it  is  more 
especially  in  connection  with  the  indecorous  in  art 
and  literature  that  the  question  arises,  and  it  is  now 
the  fashion  to  argue  as  if  there  were  no  psychological 
basis  for  reticence  at  all.  That  is  where  the  argument 
should  end;  but  fortunately  these  thinkers  do  not 
know  how  to  get  to  the  end  of  an  argument.  I  have 
heard  it  argued  that  there  is  no  more  harm  in  de¬ 
scribing  the  violation  of  one  Commandment  than  of 
another;  but  this  is  obviously  a  fallacy.  There  is  at 
least  a  case  in  psychology  for  saying  that  certain 
images  move  the  imagination  to  the  weakening  of  the 
character.  There  is  no  case  for  saying  that  the  mere 

contemplation  of  a  kit  of  burglars  tools  would  in- 

221 


222  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

flame  us  all  with  a  desire  to  break  into  houses.  There 
is  no  possibility  of  pretending  that  the  mere  sight 
of  means  to  murder  our  maiden  aunt  with  a  poker 
does  really  make  the  ill  deed  done.  But  what  strikes 
me  as  most  curious  about  the  controversy  is  this: 
that  while  our  fiction  and  journalism  is  largely  break¬ 
ing  down  the  prohibitions  for  which  there  really  was  a 
logical  case,  in  the  consideration  of  human  nature, 
they  still  very  largely  feel  the  pressure  of  prohibitions 
for  which  there  was  never  any  case  at  all.  And  the 
most  curious  thing  about  the  criticism  we  hear  di¬ 
rected  against  the  Victorian  Age  is  that  it  is  never 
directed  against  the  most  arbitrary  conventions  of 
that  age.  One  of  these,  which  I  remember  very  vividly 
in  my  youth,  was  the  convention  that  there  is  some¬ 
thing  embarrassing  or  unfair  about  a  man  mention¬ 
ing  his  religion.  There  was  something  of  the  same 
feeling  about  his  mentioning  his  money.  Now  these 
things  cannot  possibly  be  defended  by  the  same  psy¬ 
chological  argument  as  the  other.  Nobody  is  moved 
to  madness  by  the  mere  sight  of  a  church  spire,  or 
finds  uncontrollable  emotions  possess  him  at  the 
thought  of  an  archdeacon’s  hat.  Yet  there  is  still 
enough  of  that  really  irrational  Victorian  conven¬ 
tion  lingering  in  our  life  and  literature  to  make  it 
necessary  to  offer  a  defence,  if  not  an  apology,  when¬ 
ever  an  argument  depends  upon  this  fundamental  fact 
in  life. 

Now  when  I  remark  that  we  want  a  type  of  colo- 


RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY  223 

nization  rather  represented  by  the  French  Canadians, 
there  are  probably  still  a  number  of  sly  critics  who 
would  point  the  finger  of  detection  at  me  and  cry, 
as  if  they  had  caught  me  in  something  very  naughty, 
“You  believe  in  the  French  Canadians  because  they 
are  Catholics”;  which  is  in  one  sense  not  only  true, 
but  very  nearly  the  whole  truth.  But  in  another 
sense  it  is  not  true  at  all;  if  it  means  that  I  exercise 
no  independent  judgment  in  perceiving  that  this  is 
really  what  we  do  want.  Now  when  this  difficulty 
and  misunderstanding  arises,  there  is  only  one  prac¬ 
tical  way  of  meeting  it  in  the  present  state  of  public 
information,  or  lack  of  information.  It  is  to  call  what 
is  generally  described  as  an  impartial  witness;  though 
it  is  quite  probable  that  he  is  far  less  impartial  than 
I  am.  What  is  really  important  about  him  is  that,  if 
he  were  partial,  he  would  be  partial  on  the  other  side. 

The  dear  old  Daily  News,  of  the  days  of  my  youth, 
on  which  I  wrote  happily  for  many  years  and  had 
so  many  good  and  admirable  friends,  cannot  be  ac¬ 
cused  as  yet  as  being  an  organ  of  the  Jesuits.  It  was, 
and  is,  as  every  one  knows,  the  organ  of  the  Noncon¬ 
formists.  Dr.  Clifford  brandished  his  teapot  there 
when  he  was  selling  it  in  order  to  demonstrate,  by 
one  symbolical  act,  that  he  had  long  been  a  teetotaller 
and  was  now  a  Passive  Resister.  We  may  be  pardoned 
for  smiling  at  this  aspect  of  the  matter;  but  there  are 
many  other  aspects  which  are  real  and  worthy  of  all 
possible  respect.  The  tradition  of  the  old  Puritan  ideal 


224  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

does  really  descend  to  this  paper;  and  multitudes  of 
honest  and  hard-thinking  Radicals  read  it  in  my 
youth  and  read  it  still. 

I  therefore  think  that  the  following  remarks  which 
appeared  recently  in  the  Daily  News,  in  an  article 
by  Mr.  Hugh  Martin,  writing  from  Toronto,  are 
rather  remarkable.  He  begins  by  saying  that  the 
Anglo-Saxon  has  got  too  proud  to  bend  his  back;  but 
the  curious  thing  is  that  he  goes  on  to  suggest,  almost 
in  so  many  words,  that  the  backs  of  the  French 
Canadians  are  actually  strengthened,  not  only  by 
being  bent  over  rustic  spades,  but  even  by  being 
bent  before  superstitious  altars.  I  am  very  anxious 
not  to  do  my  impartial  witness  an  unfair  damage 
in  the  matter;  so  I  may  be  excused  if  I  quote  his  own 
words  at  some  little  length.  After  saying  that  the 
Anglo-Saxons  are  drawn  away  to  the  United  States, 
or  at  any  rate  to  the  industrial  cities,  he  remarks  that 
the  French  are  of  course  very  numerous  in  Quebec 
and  elsewhere,  but  that  it  is  not  here  that  the  notable 
development  is  taking  place,  and  that  Montreal,  be¬ 
ing  a  large  city,  is  showing  signs  of  the  slackening 
to  be  seen  in  other  large  cities. 

"Now  look  at  the  other  picture.  The  race  that  is 
going  ahead  is  the  French  race.  ...  In  Quebec, 
where  there  are  nearly  2,000,000  Canadians  of  French 
origin  in  a  population  of  2,350,000,  that  might  have 
been  expected.  But  as  a  matter  of  fact  it  is  not  in 
Quebec  that  the  French  are  making  good  most  con- 


RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY  225 

spicuously  .  .  .  nor  in  Nova  Scotia  and  New  Bruns¬ 
wick  is  the  comparative  success  of  the  French  stock 
most  marked.  They  are  doing  splendidly  on  the  land 
and  raising  prodigious  families.  A  family  of  twelve 
is  quite  common,  and  I  could  name  several  cases 
where  there  have  been  twenty,  who  all  lived.  The  day 
may  come  when  they  will  equal  or  outnumber  the 
Scotch,  but  that  is  some  way  ahead.  If  you  want  to 
see  what  French  stock  can  still  achieve,  you  should 
go  to  the  northern  part  of  this  province  of  Ontario. 
It  is  doing  pioneer  work.  It  is  bending  its  back  as 
men  did  in  the  old  days.  It  is  multiplying  and  staying 
on  the  soil.  It  is  content  to  be  happy  without  being 
rich. 

“Though  I  am  not  a  religious  man  myself,  I  must 
confess  I  think  religion  has  a  good  deal  to  do  with 
it.  These  French  Canadians  are  more  Catholic  than 
the  Pope.  You  might  call  a  good  many  of  them  des¬ 
perately  ignorant  and  desperately  superstitious.  They 
seem  to  me  to  be  a  century  behind  the  times  and  a 
century  nearer  happiness.” 

These  seem  to  me,  I  repeat,  to  be  rather  remark¬ 
able  words;  remarkable  if  they  appeared  anywhere, 
arresting  and  astonishing  when  they  appear  in  the 
traditional  paper  of  the  Manchester  Radicals  and  the 
nineteenth-century  Nonconformists.  The  words  are 
splendidly  straightforward  and  unaffected  in  their 
literary  form;  they  have  a  clear  ring  of  sincerity  and 
experience,  and  they  are  all  the  more  convincing  be- 


226  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

cause  they  are  written  by  somebody  who  does  not 
share  my  own  desperate  ignorance  and  desperate 
superstition.  But  he  proceeds  to  suggest  a  reason, 
and  incidentally  to  make  his  own  independence  in  the 
matter  quite  clear. 

"Apart  from  the  fact  that  their  women  bear  an 
incredible  number  of  children,  you  have  this  other 
consequence  of  their  submission  to  the  priest,  that 
a  social  organism  is  created,  which  is  of  incalculable 
value  in  the  backwoods.  The  church,  the  school,  the 
cure,  hold  each  little  group  together  as  a  unit.  Do  not 
think  for  a  moment  that  I  believe  a  general  spread 
of  Catholicism  would  turn  us  back  into  a  pioneer 
people.  One  might  just  as  reasonably  recommend  a 
return  to  early  Scottish  Protestantism.  I  merely 
record  the  fact  that  the  simplicity  of  these  people  is 
proving  their  salvation  and  is  one  of  the  most  hope¬ 
ful  things  in  Canada  to-day.” 

Of  course,  there  are  a  good  many  things  of  an 
incidental  kind  that  a  person  with  my  views  might 
comment  on  in  that  passage.  I  might  go  off  at  a  gal¬ 
lop  on  the  highly  interesting  comparison  with  early 
Scottish  Protestantism.  Very  early  Scottish  Protes¬ 
tantism,  like  very  early  English  Protestantism,  con¬ 
sisted  chiefly  of  loot.  But  if  we  take  it  as  referring 
to  the  perfectly  pure  and  sincere  enthusiasm  of  many 
Covenanters  or  early  Calvinists,  we  come  upon  the 
contrast  that  is  the  point  of  the  whole  matter.  Early 
Puritanism  was  pure  Puritanism;  but  the  purer  it  is 


RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY  227 

the  more  early  it  seems.  We  cannot  imagine  it  as  a 
good  thing  and  also  a  modern  thing.  It  might  have 
been  one  of  the  most  honest  things  in  Scotland  then. 
But  nobody  would  be  found  calling  it  one  of  the  most 
hopeful  things  in  Canada  to-day.  If  John  Knox  ap¬ 
peared  to-morrow  in  the  pulpit  of  St.  Giles,  he  would 
be  a  stickit  minister.  He  would  be  regarded  as  a  rav¬ 
ing  savage  because  of  his  ignorance  of  German  meta¬ 
physics.  That  comparison  does  not  meet  the  extraor¬ 
dinary  case  of  the  thing  that  is  older  than  Knox  and 
yet  also  newer  than  Knox.  Or  again,  I  might  point 
out  that  the  common  connotation  of  “submission  to 
the  priest”  is  misleading,  even  if  it  is  true.  It  is  like 
talking  of  the  Charge  of  the  Light  Brigade  as  the 
submission  to  Lord  Raglan.  It  is  still  more  like  talk¬ 
ing  about  the  storming  of  Jerusalem  as  the  submis¬ 
sion  to  the  Count  of  Bouillon.  In  one  sense  it  is  quite 
true;  in  another  it  is  very  untrue.  But  I  have  not  the 
smallest  desire  here  to  disturb  the  impartiality  of  my 
witness.  I  have  not  the  smallest  intention  of  using 
any  of  the  tortures  of  the  Inquisition  to  make  him 
admit  anything  that  he  did  not  wish  to  admit.  The 
admission  as  it  stands  seems  to  me  very  remarkable; 
not  so  much  because  it  is  a  tribute  to  Frenchmen  as 
colonists  as  because  it  is  a  tribute  to  colonists  as  pious 
and  devout  people.  But  what  concerns  me  most  of  all 
in  the  general  discussion  of  my  own  theme  is  the  in¬ 
sistence  on  stability.  They  are  staying  on  the  soil; 
they  are  a  social  organism;  they  are  held  together  as 


228  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

a  unit.  That  is  the  new  note  which  I  think  is  needed 
in  all  talk  of  colonization,  before  it  can  again  be  any 
part  of  the  hope  of  the  world. 

A  recent  description  of  the  Happy  Factory,  as  it 
exists  in  America  or  will  exist  in  Utopia,  rose  from 
height  to  height  of  ideality  until  it  ended  with  a  sort 
of  hush,  as  of  the  ultimate  opening  of  the  heavens, 
and  these  words  about  the  workman,  “He  turns  out 
for  his  homeward  journey  like  a  member  of  the  Stock 
Exchange.”  Any  attempt  to  imagine  humanity  in  its 
final  perfection  always  has  about  it  something  faintly 
unreal,  as  being  too  good  for  this  world;  but  the 
visionary  light  that  breaks  from  the  cloud,  in  that 
last  phrase,  accentuates  clearly  the  contrast  which  is 
to  be  drawn  between  such  a  condition  and  that  of  the 
labour  of  common  men.  Adam  left  Eden  as  a  gar¬ 
dener;  but  he  will  set  out  for  his  homeward  journey 
like  a  member  of  the  Stock  Exchange.  St.  Joseph  was 
a  carpenter;  but  he  will  be  raised  again  as  a  stock¬ 
broker.  Giotto  was  a  shepherd;  for  he  was  not  yet 
worthy  to  be  a  stockbroker.  Shakespeare  was  an  ac¬ 
tor;  but  he  dreamed  day  and  night  of  being  a  stock¬ 
broker.  Burns  was  a  ploughman;  but  if  he  sang  at 
the  plough,  how  much  more  appropriately  he  would 
have  sung  in  the  Stock  Exchange.  It  is  assumed  in 
this  kind  of  argument  that  all  humanity  has  con¬ 
sciously  or  unconsciously  hoped  for  this  consumma¬ 
tion;  and  that  if  men  were  not  brokers,  it  was  because 
they  were  not  able  to  broke.  But  this  remarkable  pas- 


RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY  229 

sage  in  Sir  Ernest  Benn’s  exposition  has  another  ap¬ 
plication  besides  the  obvious  one.  A  stockbroker  in 
one  sense  really  is  a  very  poetical  figure.  In  one  sense 
he  is  as  poetical  as  Shakespeare,  and  his  ideal  poet, 
since  he  does  give  to  airy  nothing  a  local  habitation 
and  a  name.  He  does  deal  to  a  great  extent  in  what 
economists  (in  their  poetical  way)  describe  as  imag- 
inaries.  When  he  exchanges  two  thousand  Patagonian 
Pumpkins  for  one  thousand  shares  in  Alaskan  Whale 
Blubber,  he  does  not  demand  the  sensual  satisfaction 
of  eating  the  pumpkin  or  need  to  behold  the  whale 
with  the  gross  eye  of  flesh.  It  is  quite  possible  that 
there  are  no  pumpkins;  and  if  there  is  somewhere 
such  a  thing  as  a  whale,  it  is  very  unlikely  to  obtrude 
itself  upon  the  conversation  in  the  Stock  Exchange. 
Now  what  is  the  matter  with  the  financial  world  is 
that  it  is  a  great  deal  too  full  of  imagination,  in  the 
sense  of  fiction.  And  when  we  react  against  it,  we 
naturally  in  the  first  place  react  into  realism.  When 
the  stockbroker  homeward  plods  his  weary  way  and 
leaves  the  world  to  darkness  and  Sir  Ernest  Benn, 
we  are  disposed  to  insist  that  it  is  indeed  he  who  has 
the  darkness  and  we  who  have  the  daylight.  He  has 
not  only  the  darkness  but  the  dreams,  and  all  the  un¬ 
real  leviathans  and  unearthly  pumpkins  pass  before 
him  like  a  mere  scroll  of  symbols  in  the  dreams  of 
the  Old  Testament.  But  when  the  small  proprietor 
grows  pumpkins,  they  really  are  pumpkins,  and 
sometimes  quite  a  large  pumpkin  for  quite  a  small 


230 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


proprietor.  If  he  should  ever  have  occasion  to  grow 
whales  (which  seems  improbable)  they  would  either 
be  real  whales  or  they  would  be  of  no  use  to  him.  We 
naturally  grow  a  little  impatient,  under  these  condi¬ 
tions,  when  people  who  call  themselves  practical 
scoff  at  the  small  proprietor  as  if  he  were  a  minor 
poet.  Nevertheless,  there  is  another  side  to  the  case, 
and  there  is  a  sense  in  which  the  small  proprietor  had 
better  be  a  minor  poet,  or  at  least  a  mystic.  Nay, 
there  is  even  a  sort  of  queer  paradoxical  sense  in  which 
the  stockbroker  is  a  man  of  business. 

It  is  to  that  other  side  of  small  property,  as  ex¬ 
emplified  in  the  French  Canadians,  and  an  article  on 
them  in  the  Daily  News,  that  I  devoted  my  last  re¬ 
marks.  The  really  practical  point  in  that  highly  in¬ 
teresting  statement  is,  that  in  this  case,  being  pro¬ 
gressive  is  actually  identified  with  being  what  is  called 
static.  In  this  case,  by  a  strange  paradox,  a  pioneer  is 
really  a  settler.  In  this  case,  by  a  still  stranger  para¬ 
dox,  a  settler  is  a  person  who  really  settles.  It  will  be 
noted  that  the  success  of  the  experiment  is  actually 
founded  on  a  certain  power  of  striking  root;  which 
we  might  almost  call  rapid  tradition,  as  others  talk 
of  rapid  transit.  And  indeed  the  ground  under  the 
pioneer’s  feet  can  only  be  made  solid  by  being  made 
sacred.  It  is  only  religion  that  can  thus  rapidly  give 
a  sort  of  accumulated  power  of  culture  and  legend  to 
something  that  is  crude  or  incomplete.  It  sounds  like 
a  joke  to  say  that  baptizing  a  baby  makes  the  baby 


RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY  231 

venerable;  it  suggests  the  old  joke  of  the  baby  with 
spectacles  who  died  an  enfeebled  old  dotard  at  five. 
Yet  it  is  profoundly  true  that  something  is  added  that 
is  not  only  something  to  be  venerated,  but  something 
partly  to  be  venerated  for  its  antiquity — that  is,  for 
the  unfathomable  depth  of  its  humanity.  In  a  sense 
a  new  world  can  be  baptized  as  a  new  baby  is  bap¬ 
tized,  and  become  a  part  of  an  ancient  order  not 
merely  on  the  map  but  in  the  mind.  Instead  of  crude 
people  merely  extending  their  crudity,  and  calling  that 
colonization,  it  would  be  possible  for  people  to  culti¬ 
vate  the  soil  as  they  cultivate  the  soul.  But  for  this  it 
is  necessary  to  have  a  respect  for  the  soil  as  well  as  for 
the  soul ;  and  even  a  reverence  for  it,  as  having  some 
associations  with  holy  things.  But  for  that  purpose  we 
need  some  sense  of  carrying  holy  things  with  us  and 
taking  them  home  with  us;  not  merely  the  feeling  that 
holiness  may  exist  as  a  hope.  In  the  most  exalted 
phrase,  we  need  a  real  presence.  In  the  most  popular 
phrase,  we  need  something  that  is  always  on  the  spot. 

That  is,  we  want  something  that  is  always  on  the 
spot,  and  not  only  beyond  the  horizon.  The  pioneer 
instinct  is  beginning  to  fail,  as  a  well-known  traveller 
recently  complained,  but  I  doubt  whether  he  could 
tell  us  the  reason.  It  is  even  possible  that  he  will  not 
understand  it,  in  one  radiant  burst  of  joyful  com¬ 
prehension,  if  I  tell  him  that  I  am  all  in  favour  of  a 
wild-goose  chase,  so  long  as  he  really  believes  that  the 
wild  goose  is  the  bird  of  paradise;  but  that  it  is  neces- 


232 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


sary  to  hunt  it  with  the  hounds  of  heaven.  If  it  be 
barely  possible  that  this  does  not  seem  quite  clear  to 
him,  I  will  explain  that  the  traveller  must  possess 
something  as  well  as  pursue  something,  or  he  will  not 
even  know  what  to  pursue.  It  is  not  enough  always 
to  follow  the  gleam :  it  is  necessary  sometimes  to  rest 
in  the  glow;  to  feel  something  sacred  in  the  glow  of 
the  camp  fire  as  well  as  the  gleam  of  the  polar  star. 
And  that  same  mysterious  and  to  some  divided  voice, 
which  alone  tells  that  we  have  here  no  abiding  city, 
is  the  only  voice  which  within  the  limits  of  this  world 
can  build  up  cities  that  abide. 

As  I  said  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  it  is  futile 
to  pretend  that  such  a  faith  is  not  a  fundamental  of 
the  true  change.  But  its  practical  relation  to  the  re¬ 
construction  of  property  is  that,  unless  we  understand 
this  spirit,  we  cannot  now  relieve  congestion  with 
colonization.  People  will  prefer  the  mere  nomadism  of 
the  town  to  the  mere  nomadism  of  the  wilderness. 
They  will  not  tolerate  emigration  if  it  merely  means 
being  moved  on  by  the  politicians  as  they  have  been 
moved  on  by  the  policemen.  They  will  prefer  bread 
and  circuses  to  locusts  and  wild  honey,  so  long  as  the 
forerunner  does  not  know  for  what  God  he  prepares 
the  way. 

But  even  if  we  put  aside  for  the  moment  the  strictly 
spiritual  ideals  involved  in  the  change,  we  must  admit 
that  there  are  secular  ideals  involved  which  must  be 
positive  and  not  merely  comparative,  like  the  ideal  of 


RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY  233 

progress.  We  are  sometimes  taunted  with  setting 
against  all  other  Utopias  what  is  in  truth  the  most  im¬ 
possible  Utopia;  with  describing  a  Merry  Peasant 
who  cannot  exist  except  on  the  stage,  with  depending 
on  a  China  Shepherdess  who  never  was  seen  except  on 
the  mantelpiece.  If  we  are  indeed  presenting  impos¬ 
sible  portraits  of  an  ideal  humanity,  we  are  not  alone 
in  that.  Not  only  the  Socialists  but  also  the  Capital¬ 
ists  parade  before  us  their  imaginary  and  ideal 
figures,  and  the  Capitalists  if  possible  more  than  the 
Socialists.  For  once  that  we  read  of  the  last  Earthly 
Paradise  of  Mr.  Wells,  where  men  and  women  move 
gracefully  in  simple  garments  and  keep  their  tempers 
in  a  way  in  which  we  in  this  world  sometimes  find 
difficult  (even  when  we  are  the  authors  of  Utopian 
novels),  for  once  that  we  see  the  ideal  figure  of  that 
vision,  we  see  ten  times  a  day  the  ideal  figure  of  the 
commercial  advertisers.  We  are  told  to  “Be  Like  This 
Man,”  or  to  imitate  an  aggressive  person  pointing  his 
finger  at  us  in  a  very  rude  manner  for  one  who  regards 
himself  as  a  pattern  to  the  young.  Yet  it  is  entirely 
an  ideal  portrait;  it  is  very  unlikely  (we  are  glad  to 
say)  that  any  of  us  will  develop  a  chin  or  a  finger  of 
that  obtrusive  type.  But  we  do  not  blame  either  the 
Capitalists  or  the  Socialists  for  setting  up  a  type  or 
talismanic  figure  to  fix  the  imagination.  We  do  not 
wonder  at  their  presenting  the  perfect  person  for  our 
admiration;  we  only  wonder  at  the  person  they  ad¬ 
mire.  And  it  is  quite  true  that,  in  our  movement  as 


234  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

much  as  any  other,  there  must  be  a  certain  amount  of 
this  romantic  picture-making.  Men  have  never  done 
anything  in  the  world  without  it;  but  ours  is  much 
more  of  a  reality  as  well  as  a  romance  than  the  dreams 
of  the  other  romantics.  There  cannot  be  a  nation  of 
millionaires,  and  there  has  never  yet  been  a  nation  of 
Utopian  comrades;  but  there  have  been  any  number 
of  nations  of  tolerably  contented  peasants.  In  this 
connection,  however,  the  point  is  that  if  we  do  not  di¬ 
rectly  demand  the  religion  of  small  property,  we  must 
at  least  demand  the  poetry  of  small  property.  It  is  a 
thing  about  which  it  is  definitely  and  even  urgently 
practical  to  be  poetical.  And  it  is  those  who  blame  us 
for  being  poetical  who  do  not  really  see  the  practical 
problem. 

For  the  practical  problem  is  the  goal.  The  pioneer 
notion  has  weakened  like  the  progressive  notion,  and 
for  the  same  reason.  People  could  go  on  talking  about 
progress  so  long  as  they  were  not  merely  thinking 
about  progress.  Progressives  really  had  in  their  minds 
some  notion  of  a  purpose  in  progress;  and  even  the 
most  practical  pioneer  had  some  vague  and  shadowy 
idea  of  what  he  wanted.  The  progressives  trusted  the 
tendency  of  their  time,  because  they  did  believe,  or 
at  least  had  believed,  in  a  body  of  democratic  doc¬ 
trines  which  they  supposed  to  be  in  process  of  estab¬ 
lishment.  And  the  pioneers  and  empire-builders  were 
filled  with  hope  and  courage  because,  to  do  them  jus¬ 
tice,  most  of  them  did  at  least  in  some  dim  way  be- 


RELIGION  OF  SMALL  PROPERTY  235 

lieve  that  the  flag  they  carried  stood  for  law  and 
liberty,  and  a  higher  civilization.  They  were  therefore 
in  search  of  something  and  not  merely  in  search  of 
searching.  They  subconsciously  conceived  an  end 
of  travel  and  not  endless  travelling;  they  were  not 
only  breaking  through  a  jungle  but  building  a  city. 
They  knew  more  or  less  the  style  of  architecture  in 
which  it  would  be  built,  and  they  honestly  believed  it 
was  the  best  style  of  architecture  in  the  world.  The 
spirit  of  adventure  has  failed  because  it  has  been  left 
to  adventurers.  Adventure  for  adventure’s  sake  be¬ 
came  like  art  for  art’s  sake.  Those  who  had  lost  all 
sense  of  aim  lost  all  sense  of  art  and  even  of  accident. 
The  time  has  come  in  every  department,  but  espe¬ 
cially  in  our  department,  to  make  once  again  vivid 
and  solid  the  aim  of  political  progress  or  colonial  ad¬ 
venture.  Even  if  we  picture  the  goal  of  the  pilgrimage 
as  a  sort  of  peasant  paradise,  it  will  be  far  more  prac¬ 
tical  than  setting  out  on  a  pilgrimage  which  has  no 
goal.  But  it  is  yet  more  practical  to  insist  that  we  do 
not  want  to  insist  only  on  what  are  called  the  qualities 
of  a  pioneer;  that  we  do  not  want  to  describe  merely 
the  virtues  that  achieve  adventures.  We  want  men  to 
think,  not  merely  of  a  place  which  they  would  be  in¬ 
terested  to  find,  but  of  a  place  where  they  would  be 
contented  to  stay.  Those  who  wish  merely  to  arouse 
again  the  social  hopes  of  the  nineteenth  century  must 
offer  not  an  endless  hope,  but  the  hope  of  an  end. 
Those  who  wish  to  continue  the  building  of  the  old 


236 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


colonial  idea  must  leave  off  telling  us  that  the  Church 
of  Empire  is  founded  entirely  on  the  rolling  stone. 
For  it  is  a  sin  against  the  reason  to  tell  men  that  to 
travel  hopefully  is  better  than  to  arrive;  and  when 
once  they  believe  it,  they  travel  hopefully  no  longer.

A  SUMMARY 


A  SUMMARY 


I  once  debated  with  a  learned  man  who  had  a 
curious  fancy  for  arranging  the  correspondence  in 
mathematical  patterns;  first  a  thousand  words  each 
and  then  a  hundred  words  each — and  then  altering 
them  all  to  another  pattern.  I  accepted  as  I  would  al¬ 
ways  accept  a  challenge,  especially  an  apparent  ap¬ 
peal  for  fairness,  but  I  was  tempted  to  tell  him  how 
utterly  unworkable  this  mechanical  method  is  for  a 
living  thing  like  argument.  Obviously  a  man  might 
need  a  thousand  words  to  reply  to  ten  words.  Sup¬ 
pose  I  began  the  philosophic  dialogue  by  saying,  “You 
strangle  babies/’  He  would  naturally  reply,  “Non¬ 
sense — I  never  strangled  any  babies.”  And  even  in 
that  obvious  ejaculation  he  has  already  used  twice  as 
many  words  as  I  have.  It  is  impossible  to  have  real 
debate  without  digression.  Every  definition  will  look 
like  a  digression.  Suppose  somebody  puts  to  me  some 
journalistic  statement,  say,  “Spanish  Jesuits  de¬ 
nounced  in  Parliament.”  I  cannot  deal  with  it  without 
explaining  to  the  journalist  where  I  differ  from  him 
about  the  atmosphere  and  implication  of  each  term  in 
turn.  I  cannot  answer  quickly  if  I  am  just  discovering 
slowly  that  the  man  suffers  from  a  series  of  extraor¬ 
dinary  delusions:  as  (1)  that  Parliament  is  a  popular 

representative  assembly;  (2)  that  Spain  is  an  effete 

239

and  decadent  country;  or  (3)  that  a  Spanish  Jesuit  is 
a  sort  of  soft-footed  court  chaplain;  whereas  it  was  a 
Spanish  Jesuit  who  anticipated  the  whole  democratic 
theory  of  our  day,  and  actually  hurled  it  as  a  defiance 
against  the  divine  right  of  kings.  Each  of  these  ex¬ 
planations  would  have  to  be  a  digression,  and  each 
would  be  necessary.  Now  in  this  book  I  am  well  aware 
that  there  are  many  digressions  that  may  not  at  first 
sight  seem  to  be  necessary.  For  I  have  had  to  con¬ 
struct  it  out  of  what  was  originally  a  sort  of  contro¬ 
versial  causerie;  and  it  has  proved  impossible  to  cut 
down  the  causerie  and  only  leave  the  controversy. 
Moreover,  no  man  can  controvert  with  many  foes 
without  going  into  many  subjects,  as  every  one  knows 
who  has  been  heckled.  And  on  this  occasion  I  was,  I 
am  happy  to  say,  being  heckled  by  many  foes  who 
were  also  friends.  I  was  discharging  the  double  func¬ 
tion  of  writing  essays  and  of  talking  over  the  tea- 
table,  or  preferably  over  the  tavern  table.  To  turn  this 
sort  of  mixture  of  a  gossip  and  a  gospel  into  anything 
like  a  grammar  of  Distributism  has  been  quite  im¬ 
possible.  But  I  fancy  that,  even  considered  as  a  string 
of  essays,  it  appears  more  inconsequent  than  it  really 
is;  and  many  may  read  the  essays  without  quite  see¬ 
ing  the  string.  I  have  decided,  therefore,  to  add  this 
last  essay  merely  in  order  to  sum  up  the  intention  of 
the  whole;  even  if  the  summary  be  only  a  recapitula¬ 
tion.  I  have  had  a  reason  for  many  of  my  digressions, 
which  may  not  appear  until  the  whole  is  seen  in  some 


A  SUMMARY 


241 


sort  of  perspective;  and  where  the  digression  has  no 
such  justification,  but  was  due  to  a  desire  to  answer 
a  friend  or  (what  is  even  worse)  a  disposition  towards 
idle  and  unseemly  mirth,  I  can  only  apologize  sin¬ 
cerely  to  the  scientific  reader  and  promise  to  do  my 
best  to  make  this  final  summary  as  dull  as  possible. 

If  we  proceed  as  at  present  in  a  proper  orderly 
fashion,  the  very  idea  of  property  will  vanish.  It  is 
not  revolutionary  violence  that  will  destroy  it.  It  is 
rather  the  desperate  and  reckless  habit  of  not  having 
a  revolution.  The  world  will  be  occupied,  or  rather  is 
already  occupied,  by  two  powers  which  are  now  one 
power.  I  speak,  of  course,  of  that  part  of  the  world 
that  is  covered  by  our  system,  and  that  part  of  the 
history  of  the  world  which  will  last  very  much  longer 
than  our  time.  Sooner  or  later,  no  doubt,  men  would 
rediscover  so  natural  a  pleasure  as  property.  But  it 
might  be  discovered  after  ages,  like  those  ages  filled 
with  pagan  slavery.  It  might  be  discovered  after  a 
long  decline  of  our  whole  civilization.  Barbarians 
might  rediscover  it  and  imagine  it  was  a  new  thing. 

Anyhow,  the  prospect  is  a  progress  towards  the 
complete  combination  of  two  combinations.  They  are 
both  powers  that  believe  only  in  combination;  and 
have  never  understood  or  even  heard  that  there  is  any 
dignity  in  division.  They  have  never  had  the  imagi¬ 
nation  to  understand  the  idea  of  Genesis  and  the  great 
myths:  that  Creation  itself  was  division.  The  begin¬ 
ning  of  the  world  was  the  division  of  heaven  and 


242 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


earth;  the  beginning  of  humanity  was  the  division  of 
man  and  woman.  But  these  flat  and  platitudinous 
minds  can  never  see  the  difference  between  the  crea¬ 
tive  cleavage  of  Adam  and  Eve  and  the  destructive 
cleavage  of  Cain  and  Abel.  Anyhow,  these  powers  or 
minds  are  now  both  in  the  same  mood;  and  it  is  a 
mood  of  disliking  all  division,  and  therefore  all  dis¬ 
tribution.  They  believe  in  unity,  in  unanimity,  in 
harmony.  One  of  these  powers  is  State  Socialism  and 
the  other  is  Big  Business.  They  are  already  one  spirit; 
they  will  soon  be  one  body.  For,  disbelieving  in  di¬ 
vision,  they  cannot  remain  divided;  believing  only  in 
combination,  they  will  themselves  combine.  At  pres¬ 
ent  one  of  them  calls  it  Solidarity  and  the  other  calls 
it  Consolidation.  It  would  seem  that  we  have  only  to 
wait  while  both  monsters  are  taught  to  say  Consoli- 
darity.  But,  whatever  it  is  called,  there  will  be  no 
doubt  about  the  character  of  the  world  which  they 
will  have  made  between  them.  It  is  becoming  more 
and  more  fixed  and  familiar.  It  will  be  a  world  of  or¬ 
ganization,  or  syndication,  of  standardization.  People 
will  be  able  to  get  hats,  houses,  holidays,  and  patent 
medicines  of  a  recognized  and  universal  pattern;  they 
will  be  fed,  clothed,  educated,  and  examined  by  a  wide 
and  elaborate  system;  but  if  you  were  to  ask  them  at 
any  given  moment  whether  the  agency  which  housed 
or  hatted  them  was  still  merely  mercantile  or  had  be¬ 
come  municipal,  they  probably  would  not  know,  and 
they  possibly  would  not  care. 


243 


A  SUMMARY 

Many  believe  that  humanity  will  be  happy  in  this 
new  peace;  that  classes  can  be  reconciled  and  souls  set 
at  rest.  I  do  not  think  things  will  be  quite  so  bad 
as  that.  But  I  admit  that  there  are  many  things  which 
may  make  possible  such  a  catastrophe  of  content¬ 
ment.  Men  in  large  numbers  have  submitted  to  slav¬ 
ery;  men  submit  naturally  to  government,  and  per¬ 
haps  even  especially  to  despotic  government.  But  I 
take  it  as  obvious  to  any  intelligent  person  that  this 
government  will  be  something  more  than  despotic.  It 
is  the  very  essence  of  the  Trust  that  it  has  the  power, 
not  only  to  extinguish  military  rivalry  or  mob  rebel¬ 
lion  as  has  the  State,  but  also  the  power  to  crush  any 
new  custom  or  costume  or  craft  or  private  enterprise 
that  it  does  not  choose  to  like.  Militarism  can  only 
prevent  people  from  fighting;  but  monopoly  can  pre¬ 
vent  them  from  buying  or  selling  anything  except  the 
article  (generally  the  inferior  article)  having  the 
trade  mark  of  the  monopoly.  If  anything  can  be  in¬ 
ferred  from  history  and  human  nature,  it  is  absolutely 
certain  that  the  despotism  will  grow  more  and  more 
despotic,  and  that  the  article  will  grow  more  and  more 
inferior.  There  is  no  conceivable  argument  from  psy¬ 
chology,  by  which  it  can  be  pretended  that  people 
preserving  such  a  power,  generation  after  generation, 
would  not  abuse  it  more  and  more,  or  neglect  every¬ 
thing  else  more  and  more.  We  know  what  far  less 
rigid  rule  has  become,  even  when  founded  by  spirited 
and  intelligent  rulers.  We  can  darkly  guess  the  effect 


244  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

of  larger  powers  in  the  hands  of  lesser  men.  And  if 
the  name  of  Caesar  came  at  last  to  stand  for  all  that 
we  call  Byzantine,  exactly  what  degree  of  dullness  are 
we  to  anticipate  when  the  name  of  Harrod  shall  sound 
even  duller  than  it  does?  If  China  passed  into  a  prov¬ 
erb  at  last  for  stiffness  and  monotony  after  being 
nourished  for  centuries  by  Confucius,  what  will  be  the 
condition  of  the  brains  that  have  been  nourished  for 
centuries  by  Callisthenes? 

I  leave  out  there  the  particular  case  of  my  own 
country,  where  we  are  threatened  not  with  a  long  de¬ 
cline,  but  rather  with  an  unpleasantly  rapid  collapse. 
But  taking  monopolist  capitalism  in  a  country  where 
it  is  still  in  the  vulgar  sense  successful,  as  in  the 
United  States,  we  only  see  more  clearly,  and  on  a 
more  colossal  scale,  the  long  and  descending  perspec¬ 
tives  that  point  down  to  Byzantium  or  Pekin.  It  is 
perfectly  obvious  that  the  whole  business  is  a  machine 
for  manufacturing  tenth-rate  things,  and  keeping  peo¬ 
ple  ignorant  of  first-rate  things.  Most  civilized  sys¬ 
tems  have  declined  from  a  height;  but  this  starts  on 
a  low  level  and  in  a  flat  place;  and  what  it  would  be 
like  when  it  had  really  crushed  all  its  critics  and  ri¬ 
vals  and  made  its  monopoly  watertight  for  two  hun¬ 
dred  years,  the  most  morbid  imagination  will  find  it 
hard  to  imagine.  But  whatever  the  last  stage  of  the 
story,  no  sane  man  any  longer  doubts  that  we  are 
seeing  the  first  stages  of  it.  There  is  no  longer  any 
difference  in  tone  and  type  between  collectivist  and

ordinary  commercial  order;  commerce  has  its  offi¬ 
cialism  and  communism  has  its  organization.  Private 
things  are  already  public  in  the  worst  sense  of  the 
word;  that  is,  they  are  impersonal  and  dehumanized. 
Public  things  are  already  private  in  the  worst  sense

Government  will  combine  everything  that  is  bad  in 
all  the  plans  for  a  better  world.  There  will  be  no  ec¬ 
centricity;  no  humour;  no  noble  disdain  of  the  world. 
There  will  be  nothing  but  a  loathsome  thing  called 
Social  Service;  which  means  slavery  without  loyalty. 
This  Service  will  be  one  of  the  ideals.  I  forgot  to 
mention  that  there  will  be  ideals.  All  the  wealthiest 
men  in  the  movement  have  made  it  quite  clear  that 
they  are  in  possession  of  a  number  of  these  little 
comforts.  People  always  have  ideals  when  they  can 
no  longer  have  ideas. 

The  philanthropists  in  question  will  probably  be 
surprised  to  learn  that  some  of  us  regard  this  prospect 
very  much  as  we  should  regard  the  theory  that  we 
are  to  be  evolved  back  into  apes.  We  therefore  con¬ 
sider  whether  it  is  even  yet  conceivable  to  restore  that 
long-forgotten  thing  called  Self-Government:  that  is, 
the  power  of  the  citizen  in  some  degree  to  direct  his 
own  life  and  construct  his  own  environment;  to  eat 
what  he  likes,  to  wear  what  he  chooses,  and  to  have 
(what  the  Trust  must  of  necessity  deny  him)  a  range 
of  choice.  In  these  notes  upon  the  notion,  I  have  been 


246  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

concerned  to  ask  whether  it  is  possible  to  escape  from 
this  enormous  evil  of  simplification  or  centralization, 
and  what  I  have  said  is  best  summed  up  under  two 
heads  or  in  two  parallel  statements.  They  may  seem 
to  some  to  contradict  each  other,  but  they  really  con¬ 
firm  each  other. 

First,  I  say  that  this  is  a  thing  that  could  be  done 
by  people.  It  is  not  a  thing  that  can  be  done  to  people. 
That  is  where  it  differs  from  nearly  all  Socialist 
schemes  as  it  does  from  plutocratic  philanthropy.  I 
do  not  say  that  I,  regarding  this  prospect  with  hatred 
and  contempt,  can  save  them  from  it.  I  say  that  they 
can  save  me  from  it,  and  themselves  from  it,  if  they 
also  regard  it  with  hatred  and  contempt.  But  it  must 
be  done  in  the  spirit  of  a  religion,  of  a  revolution,  and 
(I  will  add)  of  a  renunciation.  They  must  want  to  do 
it  as  they  want  to  drive  invaders  out  of  a  country  or 
to  stop  the  spread  of  a  plague.  And  in  this  respect  our 
critics  have  a  curious  way  of  arguing  in  a  circle.  They 
ask  why  we  trouble  to  denounce  what  we  cannot  de¬ 
stroy;  and  offer  an  ideal  we  cannot  attain.  They  say 
we  are  merely  throwing  away  dirty  water  before  we 
can  get  clean;  or  rather  that  we  are  merely  analysing 
the  animalcule  in  the  dirty  water,  while  we  do  not 
even  venture  to  throw  it  away.  Why  do  we  make  men 
discontented  with  conditions  with  which  they  must  be 
content?  Why  revile  an  intolerable  slavery  that  must 
be  tolerated?  But  when  we  in  turn  ask  why  our  ideal 
is  impossible  or  why  the  evil  is  indestructible,  they 


A  SUMMARY  247 

answer  in  effect,  “Because  you  cannot  persuade  people 
to  want  it  destroyed.”  Possibly;  but,  on  their  own 
showing,  they  cannot  blame  us  because  we  try.  They 
cannot  say  that  people  do  not  hate  plutocracy  enough 
to  kill  it;  and  then  blame  us  for  asking  them  to  look 
at  it  enough  to  hate  it.  If  they  will  not  attack  it  until 
they  hate  it,  then  we  are  doing  the  most  practical 
thing  we  can  do,  in  showing  it  to  be  hateful.  A  moral 
movement  must  begin  somewhere;  but  1  do  most  posi¬ 
tively  postulate  that  there  must  be  a  moral  move¬ 
ment.  This  is  not  a  financial  flutter  or  a  police  regula¬ 
tion  or  a  private  bill  or  a  detail  of  book-keeping.  It 
is  a  mighty  effort  of  the  will  of  man,  like  the  throwing 
off  of  any  other  great  evil,  or  it  is  nothing.  I  say  that 
if  men  will  fight  for  this  they  may  win;  I  have  no¬ 
where  suggested  that  there  is  any  way  of  winning 
without  fighting. 

Under  this  heading  I  have  considered  in  their 
place,  for  instance,  the  possibility  of  an  organized  boy¬ 
cott  of  big  shops.  Undoubtedly  it  would  be  some  sac¬ 
rifice  to  boycott  big  shops;  it  would  be  some  trouble 
to  seek  out  small  shops.  But  it  would  be  about  a 
hundredth  part  of  the  sacrifice  and  trouble  that  has 
often  been  shown  by  masses  of  men  making  some 
patriotic  or  religious  protest — when  they  really 
wanted  to  protest.  Under  the  same  general  rule,  I  have 
remarked  that  a  real  life  on  the  land,  men  not  only 
dwelling  on  the  land  but  living  off  it,  would  be  an 
adventure  involving  both  stubbornness  and  abnega- 


248 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


tion.  But  it  would  not  be  half  so  ascetic  as  the  sort 
of  adventure  which  it  is  a  commonplace  to  attribute 
to  colonists  and  empire-builders;  it  is  nothing  to  what 
has  been  normally  shown  by  millions  of  soldiers  and 
monks.  Only  it  is  true  that  monks  have  a  faith,  that 
soldiers  have  a  flag,  and  that  even  empire-builders 
were  presumably  under  the  impression  that  they  could 
assist  the  Empire.  But  it  does  not  seem  to  me  quite 
inconceivable,  in  the  varieties  of  religious  experience, 
that  men  might  take  as  much  notice  of  earth  as  monks 
do  of  heaven;  that  people  might  really  believe  in  the 
spades  that  create  as  well  as  in  the  swords  that  de¬ 
stroy;  and  that  the  English  who  have  colonized  every¬ 
where  else  might  begin  to  colonize  England. 

Having  thus  admitted,  or  rather  insisted,  that  this 
thing  cannot  be  done  unless  people  do  really  think  it 
worth  doing,  I  then  proceeded  to  suggest  that,  even 
in  these  different  departments,  there  are  more  people 
who  think  it  worth  doing  than  is  noticed  by  the  peo¬ 
ple  who  do  not  think  it  worth  noticing.  Thus,  even 
in  the  crowds  that  throng  the  big  shops,  you  do  in  fact 
hear  a  vast  amount  of  grumbling  at  the  big  shops — 
not  so  much  because  they  are  big  as  because  they  are 
bad.  But  these  real  criticisms  are  disconnected,  while 
the  unreal  puffs  and  praises  are  connected,  like  any 
other  conspiracy.  When  the  millionaire  owning  the 
stores  is  criticized,  it  is  by  his  customers.  When  he 
is  handsomely  complimented,  it  is  by  himself.  But 
when  he  is  cursed,  it  is  in  the  inner  chamber;  when  he 


A  SUMMARY  249 

is  praised  (by  himself)  it  is  proclaimed  from  the 
house-tops.  That  is  what  is  meant  by  publicity — a 
voice  loud  enough  to  drown  any  remarks  made  by  the 
public. 

In  the  case  of  the  land,  as  in  the  case  of  the  shops, 
I  went  on  to  point  out  that  there  is,  if  not  a  moral 
agitation,  at  least  the  materials  of  a  moral  agitation. 
Just  as  a  discontent  with  the  shops  lingers  even  among 
those  who  are  shopping,  so  a  desire  for  the  land  lin¬ 
gers  even  in  those  who  are  hardly  allowed  to  walk  on 
the  ground.  I  gave  the  instance  of  the  slum  popula¬ 
tion  of  Limehouse,  who  were  forcibly  lifted  into  high 
flats,  bitterly  lamenting  the  loss  of  the  funny  little 
farmyards  they  had  constructed  for  themselves  in  the 
corners  of  their  slum.  It  seems  absurd  to  say  of  a 
country  that  none  of  its  people  could  be  countrymen, 
when  even  its  cockneys  try  to  be  countrymen.  I  also 
noted  that,  in  the  case  of  the  country,  there  is  now  a 
general  discontent,  in  landlords  as  well  as  tenants. 
Everything  seems  to  point  to  a  simpler  life  of  one  man 
one  field,  free  as  far  as  possible  of  the  complications 
of  rent  and  labour,  especially  when  the  rent  is  so 
often  unpaid  or  unprofitable,  and  the  labourers  are 
so  often  on  strike  or  on  the  dole.  Here  again  there  may 
often  be  a  million  individuals  feeling  like  this;  but 
the  million  has  not  become  a  mob;  for  a  mob  is  a 
moral  thing.  But  I  will  never  be  so  unpatriotic  as  to 
suggest  that  the  English  could  never  conduct  an 
agrarian  war  in  England  as  the  Irish  did  in  Ireland. 


250  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

Generally,  therefore,  under  this  first  principle,  the 
thing  would  most  certainly  have  to  be  preached  rather 
like  a  Crusade;  but  it  is  quite  untrue  and  unhistorical 
to  say,  as  a  rule,  that  when  once  the  Crusade  is 
preached,  there  are  no  Crusaders. 

And  my  second  general  principle,  which  may  seem 
contradictory  but  is  confirmatory,  is  this.  I  think  the 
thing  would  have  to  be  done  step  by  step  and  with 
patience  and  partial  concessions.  I  think  this,  not  be¬ 
cause  I  have  any  faith  whatever  in  the  silly  cult  of 
slowness  that  is  sometimes  called  evolution,  but  be¬ 
cause  of  the  peculiar  circumstances  of  the  case.  First, 
mobs  may  loot  and  burn  and  rob  the  rich  man,  very 
much  to  his  spiritual  edification  and  benefit.  They 
may  not  unnaturally  do  it,  almost  absent-mindedly, 
when  they  are  thinking  of  something  else,  such  as  a 
dislike  of  Jews  or  Huguenots.  But  it  would  never  do 
for  us  to  give  very  violent  shocks  to  the  sentiment  of 
property,  even  where  it  is  very  ill-placed  or  ill- 
proportioned;  for  that  happens  to  be  the  very  senti¬ 
ment  we  are  trying  to  revive.  As  a  matter  of  psy¬ 
chology,  it  would  be  foolish  to  insult  even  an  un¬ 
feminine  feminist  in  order  to  awaken  a  delicate 
chivalry  towards  females.  It  would  be  unwise  to  use  a 
sacred  image  as  a  club  with  which  to  thump  an 
Iconoclast  and  teach  him  not  to  touch  the  holy 
images.  Where  the  old-fashioned  feeling  of  property 
is  still  honest,  I  think  it  should  be  dealt  with  by  de¬ 
grees  and  with  some  consideration.  Where  the  sense 


A  SUMMARY 


251 


of  property  does  not  exist  at  all,  as  in  millionaires, 
it  might  well  be  regarded  rather  differently;  there  it 
would  become  a  question  of  whether  property  pro¬ 
cured  in  certain  ways  is  property  at  all.  As  for  the 
case  of  cornering  and  making  monopolies  in  restraint 
of  trade,  that  falls  under  the  first  of  my  two  prin¬ 
ciples.  It  is  simply  a  question  of  whether  we  have  the 
moral  courage  to  punish  what  is  certainly  immoral. 
There  is  no  more  doubt  about  these  operations  of  high 
finance  than  there  is  about  piracy  on  the  high  seas. 
It  is  merely  a  case  of  a  country  being  so  disorderly 
and  ill-governed  that  it  becomes  infested  with  pirates. 
I  have,  therefore,  in  this  book  treated  of  Trusts  and 
Anti-Trust  Law  as  a  matter,  not  merely  for  the  popu¬ 
lar  protest  of  a  boycott  or  a  strike,  but  for  the  direct 
action  of  the  State  against  criminals.  But  when  the 
criminals  are  stronger  than  the  State,  any  attempt  to 
punish  them  will  be  certainly  called  a  rebellion  and 
may  rightly  be  called  a  Crusade. 

Recurring  to  the  second  principle,  however,  there 
is  another  and  less  abstract  reason  for  recognizing 
that  the  goal  must  be  reached  by  stages.  I  have  here 
had  to  consider  several  things  that  may  bring  us  a 
stage  nearer  to  Distributism,  even  if  they  are  in  them¬ 
selves  not  very  satisfactory  to  ardent  or  austere  Dis- 
tributists.  I  took  the  examples  of  a  Ford  car,  which 
may  be  made  by  mass  production  but  is  used  for 
individual  adventure;  for,  after  all,  a  private  car  is 
more  private  than  a  train  or  a  tram.  I  also  took  the 


252  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

example  of  a  general  supply  of  electricity,  which  might 
lead  to  many  little  workshops  having  a  chance  for  the 
first  time.  I  do  not  claim  that  all  Distributists  would 
agree  with  me  in  my  decision  here;  but  on  the  whole 
I  am  inclined  to  decide  that  we  should  use  these  things 
to  break  up  the  hopeless  block  of  concentrated  capital 
and  management,  even  if  we  urge  their  abandonment 
when  they  have  done  their  work.  We  are  concerned 
to  produce  a  particular  sort  of  men,  the  sort  of  men 
who  will  not  worship  machines  even  if  they  use 
machines.  But  it  is  essential  to  insist  at  every  stage 
that  we  hold  ourselves  free  not  only  to  cease  worship¬ 
ping  machines,  but  to  cease  using  them.  It  was  in  this 
connection  that  I  criticized  certain  remarks  of  Mr. 
Ford  and  the  whole  of  that  idea  of  standardization 
which  he  may  be  said  to  represent.  But  everywhere  I 
recognize  a  difference  between  the  methods  we  may 
use  to  produce  a  saner  society  and  the  things  which 
that  saner  society  might  itself  be  sane  enough  to  do. 
For  instance,  a  people  who  had  really  found  out  what 
fun  it  is  to  make  things  would  never  want  to  make 
most  of  them  with  a  machine.  Sculptors  do  not  want 
to  turn  a  statue  out  with  a  lathe  or  painters  to  print 
off  a  picture  as  a  pattern,  and  a  craftsman  who  was 
really  capable  of  making  pots  or  pans  would  be  no 
readier  to  condescend  to  what  is  called  manufacturing 
them.  It  is  odd,  by  the  way,  that  the  very  word 
“manufacture”  means  the  opposite  of  what  it  is  sup¬ 
posed  to  mean.  It  is  itself  a  testimony  to  a  better 


253 


A  SUMMARY 

time  when  it  did  not  mean  the  work  of  a  modern 
factory.  In  the  strict  meaning  of  words,  a  sculptor 
does  manufacture  a  statue,  and  a  factory  worker  does 
not  manufacture  a  screw. 

But,  anyhow,  a  world  in  which  there  were  many 
independent  men  would  probably  be  a  world  in  which 
there  were  more  individual  craftsmen.  When  we  have 
created  anything  like  such  a  world,  we  may  trust  it  to 
feel  more  than  the  modern  world  does  the  danger  of 
machinery  deadening  creation,  and  the  value  of  what 
it  deadens.  And  I  suggested  that  such  a  world  might 
very  well  make  special  provision  about  machines,  as 
we  all  do  about  weapons;  admitting  them  for  par¬ 
ticular  purposes,  but  keeping  watch  on  them  in  par¬ 
ticular  ways. 

But  all  that  belongs  to  the  later  stage  of  improve¬ 
ment,  when  the  commonwealth  of  free  men  already 
exists;  I  do  not  think  it  inconsistent  with  using  any 
instruments  that  are  innocent  in  themselves  in  order 
to  help  such  citizens  to  find  a  footing.  I  have  also 
noted  that  just  as  I  do  not  think  machinery  an  im¬ 
moral  instrument  in  itself,  so  I  do  not  think  State  ac¬ 
tion  an  immoral  instrument  in  itself.  The  State  might 
do  a  great  deal  in  the  first  stages,  especially  by 
education  in  the  new  and  necessary  crafts  and  labours, 
by  subsidy  or  tariff  to  protect  distributive  experiments 
and  by  special  laws,  such  as  the  taxation  of  contracts. 
All  these  are  covered  by  what  I  call  the  second  prin¬ 
ciple,  that  we  may  use  intermediate  or  imperfect  in- 


254  THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 

struments;  but  it  goes  along  with  the  first  principle, 
that  we  must  be  perfect  not  only  in  our  patience,  but 
in  our  passion  and  our  enduring  indignation. 

Lastly,  there  are  the  ordinary  and  obvious  problems 
like  that  of  population,  and  in  that  connection  I  fully 
concede  that  the  process  may  sooner  or  later  involve 
an  element  of  emigration.  But  I  think  the  emigration 
must  be  undertaken  by  those  who  understand  the  new 
England,  and  not  by  those  who  want  to  escape  from 
it  or  from  the  necessity  of  it.  Men  must  realize  the 
new  meaning  of  the  old  phrase,  "the  sacredness  of 
private  property.”  There  must  be  a  spirit  that  will 
make  the  colonist  feel  at  home  and  not  abroad.  And 
there,  I  admit,  there  is  a  difficulty;  for  I  confess  I 
know  only  one  thing  that  will  thus  give  to  a  new  soil 
the  sanctity  of  something  already  old  and  full  of  mys¬ 
tical  affections.  And  that  thing  is  a  shrine — the  real 
presence  of  a  sacramental  religion. 

Thus,  unavoidably,  I  end  on  the  note  of  another 
controversy — a  controversy  that  I  have  no  idea  of 
pursuing  here.  But  I  should  not  be  honest  if  I  did  not 
mention  it,  and  whatever  be  the  case  in  that  connec¬ 
tion  it  is  impossible  to  deny  that  there  is  a  doctrine 
behind  the  whole  of  our  political  position.  It  is  not 
necessarily  the  doctrine  of  the  religious  authority 
which  I  myself  receive;  but  it  cannot  be  denied  that 
it  must  in  a  sense  be  religious.  That  is  to  say,  it  must 
at  least  have  some  reference  to  an  ultimate  view  of  the 
universe  and  especially  of  the  nature  of  man.  Those 


A  SUMMARY 


255 


who  are  thus  ready  to  see  property  atrophied  would 
ultimately  be  ready  to  see  arms  and  legs  amputated. 
They  really  believe  that  these  could  become  extinct 
organs  like  the  appendix.  In  other  words,  there  is  in¬ 
deed  a  fundamental  difference  between  my  own  view 
and  that  vision  of  man  as  a  merely  intermediate  and 
changing  thing — a  Link,  if  not  a  Missing  Link.  The 
creature,  it  is  claimed,  once  went  on  four  legs  and  now 
goes  on  two  legs.  The  obvious  inference  would  be 
that  the  next  stage  of  evolution  will  be  for  a  man 
to  stand  on  one  leg.  And  this  will  be  of  very  great 
value  to  the  capitalist  or  bureaucratic  powers  that 
are  now  to  take  charge  of  him.  It  will  mean,  for  one 
thing,  that  only  half  the  number  of  boots  need  be 
supplied  to  the  working  classes.  It  will  mean  that  all 
wages  will  be  of  a  one-legged  sort.  But  I  would  testify 
at  the  end,  as  at  the  beginning,  that  I  believe  in  Man 
standing  on  two  legs  and  requiring  two  boots,  and 
that  1  desire  them  to  be  his  own  boots.  You  may  call  it 
conservative  to  want  this.  You  may  call  it  revolution- 
nary  to  attempt  to  get  it.  But  if  that  is  conservative, 
I  am  conservative;  if  that  is  revolutionary,  I  am  revo¬ 
lutionary — but  too  democratic  to  be  evolutionary, 
anyhow. 

The  thing  behind  Bolshevism  and  many  other  mod¬ 
ern  things  is  a  new  doubt.  It  is  not  merely  a  doubt 
about  God;  it  is  rather  specially  a  doubt  about  Man. 
The  old  morality,  the  Christian  religion,  the  Catholic 
Church,  differed  from  all  this  new  mentality  because 


256 


THE  OUTLINE  OF  SANITY 


it  really  believed  in  the  rights  of  men.  That  is,  it 
believed  that  ordinary  men  were  clothed  with  powers 
and  privileges  and  a  kind  of  authority.  Thus  the  ordi¬ 
nary  man  had  a  right  to  deal  with  dead  matter,  up 
to  a  given  point;  that  is  the  right  of  property.  Thus 
the  ordinary  man  had  a  right  to  rule  the  other  animals 
within  reason;  that  is  the  objection  to  vegetarianism 
and  many  other  things.  The  ordinary  man  had  a  right 
to  judge  about  his  own  health,  and  what  risks  he 
would  take  with  the  ordinary  things  of  his  environ¬ 
ment;  that  is  the  objection  to  Prohibition  and  many 
other  things.  The  ordinary  man  had  a  right  to  judge 
of  his  children’s  health,  and  generally  to  bring  up 
children  to  the  best  of  his  ability;  that  is  the  objection 
to  many  interpretations  of  modern  State  education. 
Now  in  these  primary  things  in  which  the  old  religion 
trusted  a  man,  the  new  philosophy  utterly  distrusts 
a  man.  It  insists  that  he  must  be  a  very  rare  sort  of 
man  to  have  any  rights  in  these  matters;  and  when 
he  is  the  rare  sort,  he  has  the  right  to  rule  others  even 
more  than  himself.  It  is  this  profound  scepticism 
about  the  common  man  that  is  the  common  point  in 
the  most  contradictory  elements  of  modern  thought. 
That  is  why  Mr.  Bernard  Shaw  wants  to  evolve  a  new 
animal  that  shall  live  longer  and  grow  wiser  than 
man.  That  is  why  Mr.  Sidney  Webb  wants  to  herd  the 
men  that  exist  like  sheep,  or  animals  much  more  fool¬ 
ish  than  man.  They  are  not  rebelling  against  an  ab-

normal  tyranny;  they  are  rebelling  against  what  they 
they  think  is  a  normal  tyranny — the  tyranny  of  the 
normal.  They  are  not  in  revolt  against  the  King. 
They  are  in  revolt  against  the  Citizen.  The  old  revo¬ 
lutionist,  when  he  stood  on  the  roof  (like  the  revolu¬ 
tionist  in  The  Dynamiter )  and  looked  over  the  city, 
used  to  say  to  himself,  “Think  how  the  princes  and 
nobles  revel  in  their  palaces;  think  how  the  captains 
and  cohorts  ride  the  streets  and  trample  on  the  peo¬ 
ple.”  But  the  new  revolutionist  is  not  brooding  on 
that.  He  is  saying,  “Think  of  all  those  stupid  men  in 
vulgar  villas  or  ignorant  slums.  Think  how  badly  they 
teach  their  children;  think  how  they  do  the  wrong 
thing  to  the  dog  and  offend  the  feelings  of  the  par¬ 
rot.”  In  short,  these  sages,  rightly  or  wrongly,  cannot 
trust  the  normal  man  to  rule  in  the  home,  and  most 
certainly  do  not  want  him  to  rule  in  the  State.  They 
do  not  really  want  to  give  him  any  political  power. 
They  are  willing  to  give  him  a  vote,  because  they  have 
long  discovered  that  it  need  not  give  him  any  power. 
They  are  not  willing  to  give  him  a  house,  or  a  wife, 
or  a  child,  or  a  dog,  or  a  cow,  or  a  piece  of  land,  be¬ 
cause  these  things  really  do  give  him  power. 

Now  we  wish  it  to  be  understood  that  our  policy 
is  to  give  him  power  by  giving  him  these  things.  We 
wish  to  insist  that  this  is  the  real  moral  division  un¬ 
derlying  all  our  disputes,  and  perhaps  the  only  one 
really  worth  disputing.  We  are  far  from  denying,  es-

pecially  at  this  time,  that  there  is  much  to  be  said  on 
the  other  side.  We  alone,  perhaps,  are  likely  to  insist 
in  the  full  sense  that  the  average  respectable  citizen 
ought  to  have  something  to  rule.  We  alone,  to  the 
same  extent  and  for  the  same  reason,  have  the  right  to 
call  ourselves  democratic.  A  republic  used  to  be  called 
a  nation  of  kings,  and  in  our  republic  the  kings  really 
have  kingdoms.  All  modern  governments,  Prussian 
or  Russian,  all  modern  movements.  Capitalist  or  So¬ 
cialist,  are  taking  away  that  kingdom  from  the  king. 
Because  they  dislike  the  independence  of  that  king¬ 
dom,  they  are  against  property.  Because  they  dislike 
the  loyalty  of  that  kingdom,  they  are  against  mar¬ 
riage. 

It  is  therefore  with  a  somewhat  sad  amusement 
that  I  note  the  soaring  visions  that  accompany  the 
sinking  wages.  I  observe  that  the  social  prophets  are 
still  offering  the  homeless  something  much  higher  and 
purer  than  a  home,  and  promising  a  supernormal  su¬ 
periority  to  people  who  are  not  allowed  to  be  normal. 
I  am  quite  content  to  dream  of  the  old  drudgery  of 
democracy,  by  which  as  much  as  possible  of  a  human 
life  should  be  given  to  every  human  being;  while  the 
brilliant  author  of  The  First  Men  in  the  Moon  will 
doubtless  be  soon  deriding  us  in  a  romance  called 
The  Last  Men  on  the  Earth.  And  indeed  I  do  believe 
that  when  they  lose  the  pride  of  personal  ownership 
they  will  lose  something  that  belongs  to  their  erect

posture  and  to  their  footing  and  poise  upon  the  planet. 
Meanwhile  I  sit  amid  droves  of  overdriven  clerks  and 
underpaid  workmen  in  a  tube  or  a  tram;  I  read  of  the 
great  conception  of  Men  Like  Gods  and  I  wonder 
when  men  will  be  like  men.
