INTRODUCTORY NOTE BY THE EDITOR

   The four books of St. Augustine On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina
   Christiana, iv libri) are a compend of exegetical theology to guide the
   reader in the understanding and interpretation of the Sacred
   Scriptures, according to the analogy of faith. The first three books
   were written A. D. 397; the fourth was added 426.

   He speaks of it in his Retractations, Bk. 2, chap. 4, as follows:

     "Finding that the books on Christian Doctrine were not finished, I
     thought it better to complete them before passing on to the revision
     of others. Accordingly, I completed the third book, which had been
     written as far as the place where a quotation is made from the
     Gospel about the woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures
     of meal till the whole was leavened.' I added also the last book,
     and finished the whole work in four books [in the year 426]: the
     first three affording aids to the interpretation of Scripture, the
     last giving directions as to the mode of making known our
     interpretation. In the second book, I made a mistake as to the
     authorship of the book commonly called the Wisdom of Solomon. For I
     have since learnt that it is not a well-established fact, as I said
     it was, that Jesus the son of Sirach, who wrote the book of
     Ecclesiasticus, wrote this book also: on the contrary, I have
     ascertained that it is altogether more probable that he was not the
     author of this book. Again, when I said, 'The authority of the Old
     Testament is contained within the limits of these forty-four books,'
     I used the phrase 'Old Testament' in accordance with ecclesiastical
     usage. But the apostle seems to restrict the application of the name
     'Old Testament' to the law which was given on Mount Sinai. And in
     what I said as to St. Ambrose having, by his knowledge of
     chronology, solved a great difficulty, when he showed that Plato and
     Jeremiah were contemporaries, my memory betrayed me. What that great
     bishop really did say upon this subject may be seen in the book
     which he wrote, 'On Sacraments or Philosophy.'"

CONTENTS OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE

  Preface, showing the utility of the treatise on Christian doctrine

BOOK I. Containing a general view of the subjects treated in Holy Scripture.

   The author divides his work into two parts, one relating to the
   discovery, the other to the expression, of the true sense of Scripture.
   He shows that to discover the meaning we must attend both to things and
   to signs, as it is necessary to know what things we ought to teach to
   the Christian people, and also the signs of these things, that is,
   where the knowledge of these things is to be sought. In this first book
   he treats of things, which he divides into three classes,--things to be
   enjoyed, things to be used, and things which use and enjoy. The only
   object which ought to be enjoyed is the Triune God, who is our highest
   good and our true happiness. We are prevented by our sins from enjoying
   God; and that our sins might be taken away, "The Word was made Flesh,"
   our Lord suffered, and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven,
   taking to Himself as his bride the Church, in which we receive
   remission of our sins. And if our sins are remitted and our souls
   renewed by grace, we may await with hope the resurrection of the body
   to eternal glory; if not, we shall be raised to everlasting punishment.
   These matters relating to faith having been expounded, the author goes
   on to show that all objects, except God, are for use; for, though some
   of them may be loved, yet our love is not to rest in them, but to have
   reference to God. And we ourselves are not objects of enjoyment to God:
   he uses us, but for our own advantage. He then goes on to show that
   love--the love of God for His own sake and the love of our neighbour
   for God's sake--is the fulfilment and the end of all Scripture. After
   adding a few words about hope, he shows, in conclusion, that faith,
   hope, and love are graces essentially necessary for him who would
   understand and explain aright the Holy Scriptures.

BOOK II.

   Having completed his exposition of things, the author now proceeds to
   discuss the subject of signs. He first defines what a sign is, and
   shows that there are two classes of signs, the natural and the
   conventional. Of conventional signs (which are the only class here
   noticed), words are the most numerous and important, and are those with
   which the interpreter of Scripture is chiefly concerned. The
   difficulties and obscurities of Scripture spring chiefly from two
   sources, unknown and ambiguous signs. The present book deals only with
   unknown signs, the ambiguities of language being reserved for treatment
   in the next book. The difficulty arising from ignorance of signs is to
   be removed by learning the Greek and Hebrew languages, in which
   Scripture is written, by comparing the various translations, and by
   attending to the context. In the interpretation of figurative
   expressions, knowledge of things is as necessary as knowledge of words;
   and the various sciences and arts of the heathen, so far as they are
   true and useful, may be turned to account in removing our ignorance of
   signs, whether these be direct or figurative. Whilst exposing the folly
   and futility of many heathen superstitions and practices, the author
   points out how all that is sound and useful in their science and
   philosophy may be turned to a Christian use. And in conclusion, he
   shows the spirit in which it behoves us to address ourselves to the
   study and interpretation of the sacred books.

BOOK III.

   The author, having discussed in the preceding book the method of
   dealing with unknown signs, goes on in this third book to treat of
   ambiguous signs. Such signs may be either direct or figurative. In the
   case of direct signs ambiguity may arise from the punctuation, the
   pronunciation, or the doubtful signification of the words, and is to be
   resolved by attention to the context, a comparison of translations, or
   a reference to the original tongue. In the case of figurative signs we
   need to guard against two mistakes:--1. the interpreting literal
   expressions figuratively; 2. the interpreting figurative expressions
   literally. The author lays down rules by which we may decide whether an
   expression is literal or figurative; the general rule being, that
   whatever can be shown to be in its literal sense inconsistent either
   with purity of life or correctness of doctrine must be taken
   figuratively. He then goes on to lay down rules for the interpretation
   of expressions which have been proved to be figurative; the general
   principle being, that no interpretation can be true which does not
   promote the love of God and the love of man. The author then proceeds
   to expound and illustrate the seven rules of Tichonius the Donatist,
   which he commends to the attention of the student of Holy Scripture.

BOOK IV.

   Passing to the second part of his work, that which treats of
   expression, the author premises that it is no part of his intention to
   write a treatise on the laws of rhetoric. These can be learned
   elsewhere, and ought not to be neglected, being indeed specially
   necessary for the Christian teacher, whom it behoves to excel in
   eloquence and power of speech. After detailing with much care and
   minuteness the various qualities of an orator, he recommends the
   authors of the Holy Scriptures as the best models of eloquence, far
   excelling all others in the combination of eloquence with wisdom. He
   points out that perspicuity is the most essential quality of style, and
   ought to be cultivated with especial care by the teacher, as it is the
   main requisite for instruction, although other qualities are required
   for delighting and persuading the hearer. All these gifts are to be
   sought in earnest prayer from God, though we are not to forget to be
   zealous and diligent in study. He shows that there are three species of
   style,--the subdued, the elegant, and the majestic; the first serving
   for instruction, the second for praise, and the third for exhortation:
   and of each of these he gives examples, selected both from Scripture
   and from early teachers of the Church, Cyprian and Ambrose. He shows
   that these various styles may be mingled, and when and for what
   purposes they are mingled; and that they all have the same end in view,
   to bring home the truth to the hearer, so that he may understand it,
   hear it with gladness, and practice it in his life. Finally, he exhorts
   the Christian teacher himself, pointing out the dignity and
   responsibility of the office he holds, to lead a life in harmony with
   his own teaching, and to show a good example to all.

Preface

   Showing that to teach rules for the interpretation of Scripture is not
   a superfluous task

   1. There are certain rules for the interpretation of Scripture which I
   think might with great advantage be taught to earnest students of the
   word, that they may profit not only from reading the works of others
   who have laid open the secrets of the sacred writings, but also from
   themselves opening such secrets to others. These rules I propose to
   teach to those who are able and willing to learn, if God our Lord do
   not withhold from me, while I write, the thoughts He is wont to
   vouchsafe to me in my meditations on this subject. But before I enter
   upon this undertaking, I think it well to meet the objections of those
   who are likely to take exception to the work, or who would do so, did I
   not conciliate them beforehand. And if, after all, men should still be
   found to make objections, yet at least they will not prevail with
   others (over whom they might have influence, did they not find them
   forearmed against their assaults), to turn them back from a useful
   study to the dull sloth of ignorance.

   2. There are some, then, likely to object to this work of mine, because
   they have failed to understand the rules here laid down. Others, again,
   will think that I have spent my labour to no purpose, because, though
   they understand the rules, yet in their attempts to apply them and to
   interpret Scripture by them, they have failed to clear up the point
   they wish cleared up; and these, because they have received no
   assistance from this work themselves, will give it as their opinion
   that it can be of no use to anybody. There is a third class of
   objectors who either really do understand Scripture well, or think they
   do, and who, because they know (or imagine) that they have attained a
   certain power of interpreting the sacred books without reading any
   directions of the kind that I propose to lay down here, will cry out
   that such rules are not necessary for any one, but that everything
   rightly done towards clearing up the obscurities of Scripture could be
   better done by the unassisted grace of God.

   3. To reply briefly to all these. To those who do not understand what
   is here set down, my answer is, that I am not to be blamed for their
   want of understanding. It is just as if they were anxious to see the
   new or the old moon, or some very obscure star, and I should point it
   out with my finger: if they had not sight enough to see even my finger,
   they would surely have no right to fly into a passion with me on that
   account. As for those who, even though they know and understand my
   directions, fail to penetrate the meaning of obscure passages in
   Scripture, they may stand for those who, in the case I have imagined,
   are just able to see my finger, but cannot see the stars at which it is
   pointed. And so both these classes had better give up blaming me, and
   pray instead that God would grant them the sight of their eyes. For
   though I can move my finger to point out an object, it is out of my
   power to open men's eyes that they may see either the fact that I am
   pointing, or the object at which I point.

   4. But now as to those who talk vauntingly of Divine Grace, and boast
   that they understand and can explain Scripture without the aid of such
   directions as those I now propose to lay down, and who think,
   therefore, that what I have undertaken to write is entirely
   superfluous. I would such persons could calm themselves so far as to
   remember that, however justly they may rejoice in God's great gift, yet
   it was from human teachers they themselves learnt to read. Now, they
   would hardly think it right that they should for that reason be held in
   contempt by the Egyptian monk Antony, a just and holy man, who, not
   being able to read himself, is said to have committed the Scriptures to
   memory through hearing them read by others, and by dint of wise
   meditation to have arrived at a thorough understanding of them; or by
   that barbarian slave Christianus, of whom I have lately heard from very
   respectable and trustworthy witnesses, who, without any teaching from
   man, attained a full knowledge of the art of reading simply through
   prayer that it might be revealed to him; after three days' supplication
   obtaining his request that he might read through a book presented to
   him on the spot by the astonished bystanders.

   5. But if any one thinks that these stories are false, I do not
   strongly insist on them. For, as I am dealing with Christians who
   profess to understand the Scriptures without any directions from man
   (and if the fact be so, they boast of a real advantage, and one of no
   ordinary kind), they must surely grant that every one of us learnt his
   own language by hearing it constantly from childhood, and that any
   other language we have learnt,--Greek, or Hebrew, or any of the
   rest,--we have learnt either in the same way, by hearing it spoken, or
   from a human teacher. Now, then, suppose we advise all our brethren not
   to teach their children any of these things, because on the outpouring
   of the Holy Spirit the apostles immediately began to speak the language
   of every race; and warn every one who has not had a like experience
   that he need not consider himself a Christian, or may at least doubt
   whether he has yet received the Holy Spirit? No, no; rather let us put
   away false pride and learn whatever can be learnt from man; and let him
   who teaches another communicate what he has himself received without
   arrogance and without jealousy. And do not let us tempt Him in whom we
   have believed, lest, being ensnared by such wiles of the enemy and by
   our own perversity, we may even refuse to go to the churches to hear
   the gospel itself, or to read a book, or to listen to another reading
   or preaching, in the hope that we shall be carried up to the third
   heaven, "whether in the body or out of the body," as the apostle says,
   and there hear unspeakable words, such as it is not lawful for man to
   utter, or see the Lord Jesus Christ and hear the gospel from His own
   lips rather than from those of men.

   6. Let us beware of such dangerous temptations of pride, and let us
   rather consider the fact that the Apostle Paul himself, although
   stricken down and admonished by the voice of God from heaven, was yet
   sent to a man to receive the sacraments and be admitted into the
   Church; and that Cornelius the centurion, although an angel announced
   to him that his prayers were heard and his alms had in remembrance, was
   yet handed over to Peter for instruction, and not only received the
   sacraments from the apostle's hands, but was also instructed by him as
   to the proper objects of faith, hope, and love. And without doubt it
   was possible to have done everything through the instrumentality of
   angels, but the condition of our race would have been much more
   degraded if God had not chosen to make use of men as the ministers of
   His word to their fellow-men. For how could that be true which is
   written, "The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are," if God gave
   forth no oracles from His human temple, but communicated everything
   that He wished to be taught to men by voices from heaven, or through
   the ministration of angels? Moreover, love itself, which binds men
   together in the bond of unity, would have no means of pouring soul into
   soul, and, as it were, mingling them one with another, if men never
   learnt anything from their fellow-men.

   7. And we know that the eunuch who was reading Isaiah the prophet, and
   did not understand what he read, was not sent by the apostle to an
   angel, nor was it an angel who explained to him what he did not
   understand, nor was he inwardly illuminated by the grace of God without
   the interposition of man; on the contrary, at the suggestion of God,
   Philip, who did understand the prophet, came to him, and sat with him,
   and in human words, and with a human tongue, opened to him the
   Scriptures. Did not God talk with Moses, and yet he, with great wisdom
   and entire absence of jealous pride, accepted the plan of his
   father-in-law, a man of an alien race, for ruling and administering the
   affairs of the great nation entrusted to him? For Moses knew that a
   wise plan, in whatever mind it might originate, was to be ascribed not
   to the man who devised it, but to Him who is the Truth, the
   unchangeable God.

   8. In the last place, every one who boasts that he, through divine
   illumination, understands the obscurities of Scripture, though not
   instructed in any rules of interpretation, at the same time believes,
   and rightly believes, that this power is not his own, in the sense of
   originating with himself, but is the gift of God. For so he seeks God's
   glory, not his own. But reading and understanding, as he does, without
   the aid of any human interpreter, why does he himself undertake to
   interpret for others? Why does he not rather send them direct to God,
   that they too may learn by the inward teaching of the Spirit without
   the help of man? The truth is, he fears to incur the reproach: "Thou
   wicked and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have put my money to the
   exchangers." Seeing, then, that these men teach others, either through
   speech or writing, what they understand, surely they cannot blame me if
   I likewise teach not only what they understand, but also the rules of
   interpretation they follow. For no one ought to consider anything as
   his own, except perhaps what is false. All truth is of Him who says, "I
   am the truth." For what have we that we did not receive? And if we have
   received it, why do we glory, as if we had not received it?

   9. He who reads to an audience pronounces aloud the words he sees
   before him: he who teaches reading, does it that others may be able to
   read for themselves. Each, however, communicates to others what he has
   learnt himself. Just so, the man who explains to an audience the
   passages of Scripture he understands is like one who reads aloud the
   words before him. On the other hand, the man who lays down rules for
   interpretation is like one who teaches reading, that is, shows others
   how to read for themselves. So that, just as he who knows how to read
   is not dependent on some one else, when he finds a book, to tell him
   what is written in it, so the man who is in possession of the rules
   which I here attempt to lay down, if he meet with an obscure passage in
   the books which he reads, will not need an interpreter to lay open the
   secret to him, but, holding fast by certain rules, and following up
   certain indications, will arrive at the hidden sense without any error,
   or at least without falling into any gross absurdity. And so although
   it will sufficiently appear in the course of the work itself that no
   one can justly object to this undertaking of mine, which has no other
   object than to be of service, yet as it seemed convenient to reply at
   the outset to any who might make preliminary objections, such is the
   start I have thought good to make on the road I am about to traverse in
   this book.

BOOK I.

   Containing a General View of the Subjects Treated in Holy Scripture

  Argument

   The author divides his work into two parts, one relating to the
   discovery, the other to the expression, of the true sense of Scripture.
   He shows that to discover the meaning we must attend both to things and
   to signs, as it is necessary to know what things we ought to teach to
   the Christian people, and also the signs of these things, that is,
   where the knowledge of these things is to be sought. In this first book
   he treats of things, which he divides into three classes,--things to be
   enjoyed, things to be used, and things which use and enjoy. The only
   object which ought to be enjoyed is the Triune God, who is our highest
   good and our true happiness. We are prevented by our sins from enjoying
   God; and that our sins might be taken away, "The Word was made Flesh,"
   our Lord suffered, and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven,
   taking to Himself as his bride the Church, in which we receive
   remission of our sins. And if our sins are remitted and our souls
   renewed by grace, we may await with hope the resurrection of the body
   to eternal glory; if not, we shall be raised to everlasting punishment.
   These matters relating to faith having been expounded, the author goes
   on to show that all objects, except God, are for use; for, though some
   of them may be loved, yet our love is not to rest in them, but to have
   reference to God. And we ourselves are not objects of enjoyment to God:
   he uses us, but for our own advantage. He then goes on to show that
   love--the love of God for His own sake and the love of our neighbour
   for God's sake--is the fulfilment and the end of all Scripture. After
   adding a few words about hope, he shows, in conclusion, that faith,
   hope, and love are graces essentially necessary for him who would
   understand and explain aright the Holy Scriptures.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   1. There are two things on which all interpretation of Scripture
   depends: the mode of ascertaining the proper meaning, and the mode of
   making known the meaning when it is ascertained. We shall treat first
   of the mode of ascertaining, next of the mode of making known, the
   meaning;--a great and arduous undertaking, and one that, if difficult
   to carry out, it is, I fear, presumptuous to enter upon. And
   presumptuous it would undoubtedly be, if I were counting on my own
   strength; but since my hope of accomplishing the work rests on Him who
   has already supplied me with many thoughts on this subject, I do not
   fear but that He will go on to supply what is yet wanting when once I
   have begun to use what He has already given. For a possession which is
   not diminished by being shared with others, if it is possessed and not
   shared, is not yet possessed as it ought to be possessed. The Lord
   saith, "Whosoever has, to him shall be given." He will give, then, to
   those who have; that is to say, if they use freely and cheerfully what
   they have received, He will add to and perfect His gifts. The loaves in
   the miracle were only five and seven in number before the disciples
   began to divide them among the hungry people. But when once they began
   to distribute them, though the wants of so many thousands were
   satisfied, they filled baskets with the fragments that were left. Now,
   just as that bread increased in the very act of breaking it, so those
   thoughts which the Lord has already vouchsafed to me with a view to
   undertaking this work will, as soon as I begin to impart them to
   others, be multiplied by His grace, so that, in this very work of
   distribution in which I have engaged, so far from incurring loss and
   poverty, I shall be made to rejoice in a marvellous increase of wealth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   2. All instruction is either about things or about signs; but things
   are learnt by means of signs. I now use the word "thing" in a strict
   sense, to signify that which is never employed as a sign of anything
   else: for example, wood, stone, cattle, and other things of that kind.
   Not, however, the wood which we read Moses cast into the bitter waters
   to make them sweet, nor the stone which Jacob used as a pillow, nor the
   ram which Abraham offered up instead of his son; for these, though they
   are things, are also signs of other things. There are signs of another
   kind, those which are never employed except as signs: for example,
   words. No one uses words except as signs of something else; and hence
   may be understood what I call signs: those things, to wit, which are
   used to indicate something else. Accordingly, every sign is also a
   thing; for what is not a thing is nothing at all. Every thing, however,
   is not also a sign. And so, in regard to this distinction between
   things and signs, I shall, when I speak of things, speak in such a way
   that even if some of them may be used as signs also, that will not
   interfere with the division of the subject according to which I am to
   discuss things first and signs afterwards. But we must carefully
   remember that what we have now to consider about things is what they
   are in themselves, not what other things they are signs of.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   3. There are some things, then, which are to be enjoyed, others which
   are to be used, others still which enjoy and use. Those things which
   are objects of enjoyment make us happy. Those things which are objects
   of use assist, and (so to speak) support us in our efforts after
   happiness, so that we can attain the things that make us happy and rest
   in them. We ourselves, again, who enjoy and use these things, being
   placed among both kinds of objects, if we set ourselves to enjoy those
   which we ought to use, are hindered in our course, and sometimes even
   led away from it; so that, getting entangled in the love of lower
   gratifications, we lag behind in, or even altogether turn back from,
   the pursuit of the real and proper objects of enjoyment.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   4. For to enjoy a thing is to rest with satisfaction in it for its own
   sake. To use, on the other hand, is to employ whatever means are at
   one's disposal to obtain what one desires, if it is a proper object of
   desire; for an unlawful use ought rather to be called an abuse.
   Suppose, then, we were wanderers in a strange country, and could not
   live happily away from our fatherland, and that we felt wretched in our
   wandering, and wishing to put an end to our misery, determined to
   return home. We find, however, that we must make use of some mode of
   conveyance, either by land or water, in order to reach that fatherland
   where our enjoyment is to commence. But the beauty of the country
   through which we pass, and the very pleasure of the motion, charm our
   hearts, and turning these things which we ought to use into objects of
   enjoyment, we become unwilling to hasten the end of our journey; and
   becoming engrossed in a factitious delight, our thoughts are diverted
   from that home whose delights would make us truly happy. Such is a
   picture of our condition in this life of mortality. We have wandered
   far from God; and if we wish to return to our Father's home, this world
   must be used, not enjoyed, that so the invisible things of God may be
   clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,--that is,
   that by means of what is material and temporary we may lay hold upon
   that which is spiritual and eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   5. The true objects of enjoyment, then, are the Father and the Son and
   the Holy Spirit, who are at the same time the Trinity, one Being,
   supreme above all, and common to all who enjoy Him, if He is an object,
   and not rather the cause of all objects, or indeed even if He is the
   cause of all. For it is not easy to find a name that will suitably
   express so great excellence, unless it is better to speak in this way:
   The Trinity, one God, of whom are all things, through whom are all
   things, in whom are all things. Thus the Father and the Son and the
   Holy Spirit, and each of these by Himself, is God, and at the same time
   they are all one God; and each of them by Himself is a complete
   substance, and yet they are all one substance. The Father is not the
   Son nor the Holy Spirit; the Son is not the Father nor the Holy Spirit;
   the Holy Spirit is not the Father nor the Son: but the Father is only
   Father, the Son is only Son, and the Holy Spirit is only Holy Spirit.
   To all three belong the same eternity, the same unchangeableness, the
   same majesty, the same power. In the Father is unity, in the Son
   equality, in the Holy Spirit the harmony of unity and equality; and
   these three attributes are all one because of the Father, all equal
   because of the Son, and all harmonious because of the Holy Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   6. Have I spoken of God, or uttered His praise, in any worthy way? Nay,
   I feel that I have done nothing more than desire to speak; and if I
   have said anything, it is not what I desired to say. How do I know
   this, except from the fact that God is unspeakable? But what I have
   said, if it had been unspeakable, could not have been spoken. And so
   God is not even to be called "unspeakable," because to say even this is
   to speak of Him. Thus there arises a curious contradiction of words,
   because if the unspeakable is what cannot be spoken of, it is not
   unspeakable if it can be called unspeakable. And this opposition of
   words is rather to be avoided by silence than to be explained away by
   speech. And yet God, although nothing worthy of His greatness can be
   said of Him, has condescended to accept the worship of men's mouths,
   and has desired us through the medium of our own words to rejoice in
   His praise. For on this principle it is that He is called Deus (God).
   For the sound of those two syllables in itself conveys no true
   knowledge of His nature; but yet all who know the Latin tongue are led,
   when that sound reaches their ears, to think of a nature supreme in
   excellence and eternal in existence.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   7. For when the one supreme God of gods is thought of, even by those
   who believe that there are other gods, and who call them by that name,
   and worship them as gods, their thought takes the form of an endeavour
   to reach the conception of a nature, than which nothing more excellent
   or more exalted exists. And since men are moved by different kinds of
   pleasures, partly by those which pertain to the bodily senses, partly
   by those which pertain to the intellect and soul, those of them who are
   in bondage to sense think that either the heavens, or what appears to
   be most brilliant in the heavens, or the universe itself, is God of
   gods: or if they try to get beyond the universe, they picture to
   themselves something of dazzling brightness, and think of it vaguely as
   infinite, or of the most beautiful form conceivable; or they represent
   it in the form of the human body, if they think that superior to all
   others. Or if they think that there is no one God supreme above the
   rest, but that there are many or even innumerable gods of equal rank,
   still these too they conceive as possessed of shape and form, according
   to what each man thinks the pattern of excellence. Those, on the other
   hand, who endeavour by an effort of the intelligence to reach a
   conception of God, place Him above all visible and bodily natures, and
   even above all intelligent and spiritual natures that are subject to
   change. All, however, strive emulously to exalt the excellence of God:
   nor could any one be found to believe that any being to whom there
   exists a superior is God. And so all concur in believing that God is
   that which excels in dignity all other objects.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   8. And since all who think about God think of Him as living, they only
   can form any conception of Him that is not absurd and unworthy who
   think of Him as life itself; and, whatever may be the bodily form that
   has suggested itself to them, recognize that it is by life it lives or
   does not live, and prefer what is living to what is dead; who
   understand that the living bodily form itself, however it may outshine
   all others in splendour, overtop them in size, and excel them in
   beauty, is quite a distinct thing from the life by which it is
   quickened; and who look upon the life as incomparably superior in
   dignity and worth to the mass which is quickened and animated by it.
   Then, when they go on to look into the nature of the life itself, if
   they find it mere nutritive life, without sensibility, such as that of
   plants, they consider it inferior to sentient life, such as that of
   cattle; and above this, again, they place intelligent life, such as
   that of men. And, perceiving that even this is subject to change, they
   are compelled to place above it, again, that unchangeable life, which
   is not at one time foolish, at another time wise, but on the contrary
   is wisdom itself. For a wise intelligence, that is, one that has
   attained to wisdom, was, previous to its attaining wisdom, unwise. But
   wisdom itself never was unwise, and never can become so. And if men
   never caught sight of this wisdom, they could never with entire
   confidence prefer a life which is unchangeably wise to one that is
   subject to change. This will be evident, if we consider that the very
   rule of truth by which they affirm the unchangeable life to be the more
   excellent, is itself unchangeable: and they cannot find such a rule,
   except by going beyond their own nature; for they find nothing in
   themselves that is not subject to change.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   9. Now, no one is so egregiously silly as to ask, "How do you know that
   a life of unchangeable wisdom is preferable to one of change?" For that
   very truth about which he asks, how I know it? is unchangeably fixed in
   the minds of all men, and presented to their common contemplation. And
   the man who does not see it is like a blind man in the sun, whom it
   profits nothing that the splendour of its light, so clear and so near,
   is poured into his very eyeballs. The man, on the other hand, who sees,
   but shrinks from this truth, is weak in his mental vision from dwelling
   long among the shadows of the flesh. And thus men are driven back from
   their native land by the contrary blasts of evil habits, and pursue
   lower and less valuable objects in preference to that which they own to
   be more excellent and more worthy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   10. Wherefore, since it is our duty fully to enjoy the truth which
   lives unchangeably, and truth for the things which He has made, the
   soul must be purified that it may have power to perceive that light,
   and to rest in it when it is perceived. And let us look upon this
   purification as a kind of journey or voyage to our native land. For it
   is not by change of place that we can come nearer to Him who is in
   every place, but by the cultivation of pure desires and virtuous
   habits.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   11. But of this we should have been wholly incapable, had not Wisdom
   condescended to adapt Himself to our weakness, and to show us a pattern
   of holy life in the form of our own humanity. Yet, since we when we
   come to Him do wisely, He when He came to us was considered by proud
   men to have done very foolishly. And since we when we come to Him
   become strong, He when He came to us was looked upon as weak. But "the
   foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is
   stronger than men." And thus, though Wisdom was Himself our home, He
   made Himself also the way by which we should reach our home.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   And though He is everywhere present to the inner eye when it is sound
   and clear, He condescended to make Himself manifest to the outward eye
   of those whose inward sight is weak and dim. "For after that, in the
   wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the
   foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."

   12. Not then in the sense of traversing space, but because He appeared
   to mortal men in the form of mortal flesh, He is said to have come to
   us. For He came to a place where He had always been, seeing that "He
   was in the world, and the world was made by Him." But, because men, who
   in their eagerness to enjoy the creature instead of the Creator had
   grown into the likeness of this world, and are therefore most
   appropriately named "the world," did not recognize Him, therefore the
   evangelist says, "and the world knew Him not." Thus, in the wisdom of
   God, the world by wisdom knew not God. Why then did He come, seeing
   that He was already here, except that it pleased God through the
   foolishness of preaching to save them that believe?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   In what way did He come but this, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt
   among us"? Just as when we speak, in order that what we leave in our
   minds may enter through the ear into the mind of the hearer, the word
   which we have in our hearts becomes an outward sound and is called
   speech; and yet our thought does not lose itself in the sound, but
   remains complete in itself, and takes the form of speech without being
   modified in its own nature by the change: so the Divine Word, though
   suffering no change of nature, yet became flesh, that He might dwell
   among us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   13. Moreover, as the use of remedies is the way to health, so this
   remedy took up sinners to heal and restore them. And just as surgeons,
   when they bind up wounds, do it not in a slovenly way, but carefully,
   that there may be a certain degree of neatness in the binding, in
   addition to its mere usefulness, so our medicine, Wisdom, was by His
   assumption of humanity adapted to our wounds, curing some of them by
   their opposites, some of them by their likes. And just as he who
   ministers to a bodily hurt in some cases applies contraries, as cold to
   hot, moist to dry, etc., and in other cases applies likes, as a round
   cloth to a round wound, or an oblong cloth to an oblong wound, and does
   not fit the same bandage to all limbs, but puts like to like; in the
   same way the Wisdom of God in healing man has applied Himself to his
   cure, being Himself healer and medicine both in one. Seeing, then, that
   man fell through pride, He restored him through humility. We were
   ensnared by the wisdom of the serpent: we are set free by the
   foolishness of God. Moreover, just as the former was called wisdom, but
   was in reality the folly of those who despised God, so the latter is
   called foolishness, but is true wisdom in those who overcome the devil.
   We used our immortality so badly as to incur the penalty of death:
   Christ used His mortality so well as to restore us to life. The disease
   was brought in through a woman's corrupted soul: the remedy came
   through a woman's virgin body. To the same class of opposite remedies
   it belongs, that our vices are cured by the example of His virtues. On
   the other hand, the following are, as it were, bandages made in the
   same shape as the limbs and wounds to which they are applied: He was
   born of a woman to deliver us who fell through a woman: He came as a
   man to save us who are men, as a mortal to save us who are mortals, by
   death to save us who were dead. And those who can follow out the matter
   more fully, who are not hurried on by the necessity of carrying out a
   set undertaking, will find many other points of instruction in
   considering the remedies, whether opposites or likes, employed in the
   medicine of Christianity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   14. The belief of the resurrection of our Lord from the dead, and of
   His ascension into heaven, has strengthened our faith by adding a great
   buttress of hope. For it clearly shows how freely He laid down His life
   for us when He had it in His power thus to take it up again. With what
   assurance, then, is the hope of believers animated, when they reflect
   how great He was who suffered so great things for them while they were
   still in unbelief! And when men look for Him to come from heaven as the
   judge of quick and dead, it strikes great terror into the careless, so
   that they retake themselves to diligent preparation, and learn by holy
   living to long for His approach, instead of quaking at it on account of
   their evil deeds. And what tongue can tell, or what imagination can
   conceive, the reward He will bestow at the last, when we consider that
   for our comfort in this earthly journey He has given us so freely of
   His Spirit, that in the adversities of this life we may retain our
   confidence in, and love for, Him whom as yet we see not; and that He
   has also given to each gifts suitable for the building up of His
   Church, that we may do what He points out as right to be done, not only
   without a murmur, but even with delight?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   15. For the Church is His body, as the apostle's teaching shows us; and
   it is even called His spouse. His body, then, which has many members,
   and all performing different functions, He holds together in the bond
   of unity and love, which is its true health. Moreover He exercises it
   in the present time, and purges it with many wholesome afflictions,
   that when He has transplanted it from this world to the eternal world,
   He may take it to Himself as His bride, without spot or wrinkle, or any
   such thing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   16. Further, when we are on the way, and that not a way that lies
   through space, but through a change of affections, and one which the
   guilt of our past sins like a hedge of thorns barred against us, what
   could He, who was willing to lay Himself down as the way by which we
   should return, do that would be still gracious and more merciful,
   except to forgive us all our sins, and by being crucified for us to
   remove the stern decrees that barred the door against our return?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 18

   17. He has given, therefore, the keys to His Church, that whatsoever it
   should bind on earth might be bound in heaven, and whatsoever it should
   loose on earth might be loosed in heaven; that is to say, that
   whosoever in the Church should not believe that his sins are remitted,
   they should not be remitted to him; but that whosoever should believe,
   and should repent, and turn from his sins, should be saved by the same
   faith and repentance on the ground of which he is received into the
   bosom of the Church. For he who does not believe that his sins can be
   pardoned, falls into despair, and becomes worse, as if no greater good
   remained for him than to be evil, when he has ceased to have faith in
   the results of his own repentance.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   18. Furthermore, as there is a kind of death of the soul, which
   consists in the putting away of former habits and former ways of life,
   and which comes through repentance, so also the death of the body
   consists in the dissolution of the former principle of life. And just
   as the soul, after it has put away and destroyed by repentance its
   former habits, is created anew after a better pattern, so we must hope
   and believe that the body, after that death which we all owe as a debt
   contracted through sin, shall at the resurrection be changed into a
   better form;--not that flesh and blood shall inherit the kingdom of God
   (for that is impossible), but that this corruptible shall put on
   incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality. And thus the
   body, being the source of no uneasiness because it can feel no want,
   shall be animated by a spirit perfectly pure and happy, and shall enjoy
   unbroken peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 20

   19. Now he whose soul does not die to this world and begin here to be
   conformed to the truth, falls when the body dies into a more terrible
   death, and shall revive, not to change his earthly for a heavenly
   habitation, but to endure the penalty of his sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 21

   And so faith clings to the assurance, and we must believe that it is so
   in fact, that neither the human soul nor the human body suffers
   complete extinction, but that the wicked rise again to endure
   inconceivable punishment, and the good to receive eternal life.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 22

   20. Among all these things, then, those only are the true objects of
   enjoyment which we have spoken of as eternal and unchangeable. The rest
   are for use, that we may be able to arrive at the full enjoyment of the
   former. We, however, who enjoy and use other things are things
   ourselves. For a great thing truly is man, made after the image and
   similitude of God, not as respects the mortal body in which he is
   clothed, but as respects the rational soul by which he is exalted in
   honour above the beasts. And so it becomes an important question,
   whether men ought to enjoy, or to use, themselves, or to do both. For
   we are commanded to love one another: but it is a question whether man
   is to be loved by man for his own sake, or for the sake of something
   else. If it is for his own sake, we enjoy him; if it is for the sake of
   something else, we use him. It seems to me, then, that he is to be
   loved for the sake of something else. For if a thing is to be loved for
   its own sake, then in the enjoyment of it consists a happy life, the
   hope of which at least, if not yet the reality, is our comfort in the
   present time. But a curse is pronounced on him who places his hope in
   man.

   21. Neither ought any one to have joy in himself, if you look at the
   matter clearly, because no one ought to love even himself for his own
   sake, but for the sake of Him who is the true object of enjoyment. For
   a man is never in so good a state as when his whole life is a journey
   towards the unchangeable life, and his affections are entirely fixed
   upon that. If, however, he loves himself for his own sake, he does not
   look at himself in relation to God, but turns his mind in upon himself,
   and so is not occupied with anything that is unchangeable. And thus he
   does not enjoy himself at his best, because he is better when his mind
   is fully fixed upon, and his affections wrapped up in, the unchangeable
   good, than when he turns from that to enjoy even himself. Wherefore if
   you ought not to love even yourself for your own sake, but for His in
   whom your love finds its most worthy object, no other man has a right
   to be angry if you love him too for God's sake. For this is the law of
   love that has been laid down by Divine authority: "Thou shalt love thy
   neighbour as thyself;" but, "Thou shalt love God with all thy heart,
   and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind:" so that you are to
   concentrate all your thoughts, your whole life, and your whole
   intelligence upon Him from whom you derive all that you bring. For when
   He says, "With all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
   mind," He means that no part of our life is to be unoccupied, and to
   afford room, as it were, for the wish to enjoy some other object, but
   that whatever else may suggest itself to us as an object worthy of love
   is to be borne into the same channel in which the whole current of our
   affections flows. Whoever, then, loves his neighbour aright, ought to
   urge upon him that he too should love God with his whole heart, and
   soul, and mind. For in this way, loving his neighbour as himself, a man
   turns the whole current of his love both for himself and his neighbour
   into the channel of the love of God, which suffers no stream to be
   drawn off from itself by whose diversion its own volume would be
   diminished.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 23

   22. Those things which are objects of use are not all, however, to be
   loved, but those only which are either united with us in a common
   relation to God, such as a man or an angel, or are so related to us as
   to need the goodness of God through our instrumentality, such as the
   body. For assuredly the martyrs did not love the wickedness of their
   persecutors, although they used it to attain the favour of God. As,
   then, there are four kinds of things that are to be loved,--first, that
   which is above us; second, ourselves; third, that which is on a level
   with us; fourth, that which is beneath us,--no precepts need be given
   about the second and fourth of these. For, however far a man may fall
   away from the truth, he still continues to love himself, and to love
   his own body. The soul which flies away from the unchangeable Light,
   the Ruler of all things, does so that it may rule over itself and over
   its own body; and so it cannot but love both itself and its own body.

   23. Moreover, it thinks it has attained something very great if it is
   able to lord it over its companions, that is, other men. For it is
   inherent in the sinful soul to desire above all things, and to claim as
   due to itself, that which is properly due to God only. Now such love of
   itself is more correctly called hate. For it is not just that it should
   desire what is beneath it to be obedient to it while itself will not
   obey its own superior; and most justly has it been said, "He who loveth
   iniquity hateth his own soul." And accordingly the soul becomes weak,
   and endures much suffering about the mortal body. For, of course, it
   must love the body, and be grieved at its corruption; and the
   immortality and incorruptibility of the body spring out of the health
   of the soul. Now the health of the soul is to cling steadfastly to the
   better part, that is, to the unchangeable God. But when it aspires to
   lord it even over those who are by nature its equals,--that is, its
   fellow-men,--this is a reach of arrogance utterly intolerable.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 24

   24. No man, then, hates himself. On this point, indeed, no question was
   ever raised by any sect. But neither does any man hate his own body.
   For the apostle says truly, "No man ever yet hated his own flesh." And
   when some people say that they would rather be without a body
   altogether, they entirely deceive themselves. For it is not their body,
   but its corruptions and its heaviness, that they hate. And so it is not
   no body, but an uncorrupted and very light body, that they want. But
   they think a body of that kind would be no body at all, because they
   think such a thing as that must be a spirit. And as to the fact that
   they seem in some sort to scourge their bodies by abstinence and toil,
   those who do this in the right spirit do it not that they may get rid
   of their body, but that they may have it in subjection and ready for
   every needful work. For they strive by a kind of toilsome exercise of
   the body itself to root out those lusts that are hurtful to the body,
   that is, those habits and affections of the soul that lead to the
   enjoyment of unworthy objects. They are not destroying themselves; they
   are taking care of their health.

   25. Those, on the other hand, who do this in a perverse spirit, make
   war upon their own body as if it were a natural enemy. And in this
   matter they are led astray by a mistaken interpretation of what they
   read: "The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
   flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other." For this is said
   of the carnal habit yet unsubdued, against which the spirit lusteth,
   not to destroy the body, but to eradicate the lust of the body--i.e.,
   its evil habit--and thus to make it subject to the spirit, which is
   what the order of nature demands. For as, after the resurrection, the
   body, having become wholly subject to the spirit, will live in perfect
   peace to all eternity; even in this life we must make it an object to
   have the carnal habit changed for the better, so that its inordinate
   affections may not war against the soul. And until this shall take
   place, "the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
   the flesh;" the spirit struggling, not in hatred, but for the mastery,
   because it desires that what it loves should be subject to the higher
   principle; and the fleshy struggling, not in hatred, but because of the
   bondage of habit which it has derived from its parent stock, and which
   has grown in upon it by a law of nature till it has become inveterate.
   The spirit, then, in subduing the flesh, is working as it were to
   destroy the ill founded peace of an evil habit, and to bring about the
   real peace which springs out of a good habit. Nevertheless, not even
   those who, led astray by false notions, hate their bodies would be
   prepared to sacrifice one eye, even supposing they could do so without
   suffering any pain, and that they had as much sight left in one as they
   formerly had in two, unless some object was to be attained which would
   overbalance the loss. This and other indications of the same kind are
   sufficient to show those who candidly seek the truth how well-founded
   is the statement of the apostle when he says, "No man ever yet hated
   his own flesh." He adds too, "but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as
   the Lord the Church".
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 25

   26. Man, therefore, ought to be taught the due measure of loving, that
   is, in what measure he may love himself so as to be of service to
   himself. For that he does love himself, and does desire to do good to
   himself, nobody but a fool would doubt. He is to be taught, too, in
   what measure to love his body, so as to care for it wisely and within
   due limits. For it is equally manifest that he loves his body also, and
   desires to keep it safe and sound. And yet a man may have something
   that he loves better than the safety and soundness of his body. For
   many have been found voluntarily to suffer both pains and amputations
   of some of their limbs that they might obtain other objects which they
   valued more highly. But no one is to be told not to desire the safety
   and health of his body because there is something he desires more. For
   the miser, though he loves money, buys bread for himself,--that is, he
   gives away money that he is very fond of and desires to heap up,--but
   it is because he values more highly the bodily health which the bread
   sustains. It is superfluous to argue longer on a point so very plain,
   but this is just what the error of wicked men often compels us to do.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 26

   27. Seeing, then, that there is no need of a command that every man
   should love himself and his own body,--seeing, that is, that we love
   ourselves, and what is beneath us but connected with us, through a law
   of nature which has never been violated, and which is common to us with
   the beasts (for even the beasts love themselves and their own
   bodies),--it only remained necessary to lay injunctions upon us in
   regard to God above us, and our neighbour beside us. "Thou shalt love,"
   He says, "the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
   and with all thy mind; and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On
   these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Thus the end
   of the commandment is love, and that twofold, the love of God and the
   love of our neighbour. Now, if you take yourself in your
   entirety,--that is, soul and body together,--and your neighbour in his
   entirety, soul and body together (for man is made up of soul and body),
   you will find that none of the classes of things that are to be loved
   is overlooked in these two commandments. For though, when the love of
   God comes first, and the measure of our love for Him is prescribed in
   such terms that it is evident all other things are to find their centre
   in Him, nothing seems to be said about our love for ourselves; yet when
   it is said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself," it at once
   becomes evident that our love for ourselves has not been overlooked.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 27

   28. Now he is a man of just and holy life who forms an unprejudiced
   estimate of things, and keeps his affections also under strict control,
   so that he neither loves what he ought not to love, nor fails to love
   what he ought to love, nor loves that more which ought to be loved
   less, nor loves that equally which ought to be loved either less or
   more, nor loves that less or more which ought to be loved equally. No
   sinner is to be loved as a sinner; and every man is to be loved as a
   man for God's sake; but God is to be loved for His own sake. And if God
   is to be loved more than any man, each man ought to love God more than
   himself. Likewise we ought to love another man better than our own
   body, because all things are to be loved in reference to God, and
   another man can have fellowship with us in the enjoyment of God,
   whereas our body cannot; for the body only lives through the soul, and
   it is by the soul that we enjoy God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 28

   29. Further, all men are to be loved equally. But since you cannot do
   good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who, by the
   accidents of time, or place, or circumstance, are brought into closer
   connection with you. For, suppose that you had a great deal of some
   commodity, and felt bound to give it away to somebody who had none, and
   that it could not be given to more than one person; if two persons
   presented themselves, neither of whom had either from need or
   relationship a greater claim upon you than the other, you could do
   nothing fairer than choose by lot to which you would give what could
   not be given to both. Just so among men: since you cannot consult for
   the good of them all, you must take the matter as decided for you by a
   sort of lot, according as each man happens for the time being to be
   more closely connected with you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 29

   30. Now of all who can with us enjoy God, we love partly those to whom
   we render services, partly those who render services to us, partly
   those who both help us in our need and in turn are helped by us, partly
   those upon whom we confer no advantage and from whom we look for none.
   We ought to desire, however, that they should all join with us in
   loving God, and all the assistance that we either give them or accept
   from them should tend to that one end. For in the theatres, dens of
   iniquity though they be, if a man is fond of a particular actor, and
   enjoys his art as a great or even as the very greatest good, he is fond
   of all who join with him in admiration of his favourite, not for their
   own sakes, but for the sake of him whom they admire in common; and the
   more fervent he is in his admiration, the more he works in every way he
   can to secure new admirers for him, and the more anxious he becomes to
   show him to others; and if he find any one comparatively indifferent,
   he does all he can to excite his interest by urging his favorite's
   merits: if, however, he meet with any one who opposes him, he is
   exceedingly displeased by such a man's contempt of his favourite, and
   strives in every way he can to remove it. Now, if this be so, what does
   it become us to do who live in the fellowship of the love of God, the
   enjoyment of whom is true happiness of life, to whom all who love Him
   owe both their own existence and the love they bear Him, concerning
   whom we have no fear that any one who comes to know Him will be
   disappointed in Him, and who desires our love, not for any gain to
   Himself, but that those who love Him may obtain an eternal reward, even
   Himself whom they love? And hence it is that we love even our enemies.
   For we do not fear them, seeing they cannot take away from us what we
   love; but we pity them rather, because the more they hate us the more
   are they separated from Him whom we love. For if they would turn to
   Him, they must of necessity love Him as the supreme good, and love us
   too as partakers with them in so great a blessing.

  Chapter 30

   31. There arises further in this connection a question about angels.
   For they are happy in the enjoyment of Him whom we long to enjoy; and
   the more we enjoy Him in this life as through a glass darkly, the more
   easy do we find it to bear our pilgrimage, and the more eagerly do we
   long for its termination. But it is not irrational to ask whether in
   those two commandments is included the love of angels also. For that He
   who commanded us to love our neighbour made no exception, as far as men
   are concerned, is shown both by our Lord Himself in the Gospel, and by
   the Apostle Paul. For when the man to whom our Lord delivered those two
   commandments, and to whom He said that on these hang all the law and
   the prophets, asked Him, "And who is my neighbour?" He told him of a
   certain man who, going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, fell among
   thieves, and was severely wounded by them, and left naked and half
   dead. And He showed him that nobody was neighbour to this man except
   him who took pity upon him and came forward to relieve and care for
   him. And the man who had asked the question admitted the truth of this
   when he was himself interrogated in turn. To whom our Lord says, "Go
   and do thou likewise;" teaching us that he is our neighbour whom it is
   our duty to help in his need, or whom it would be our duty to help if
   he were in need. Whence it follows, that he whose duty it would be in
   turn to help us is our neighbour. For the name "neighbour" is a
   relative one, and no one can be neighbour except to a neighbour. And,
   again, who does not see that no exception is made of any one as a
   person to whom the offices of mercy may be denied when our Lord extends
   the rule even to our enemies? "Love your enemies, do good to them that
   hate you."

   32. And so also the Apostle Paul teaches when he says: "For this, Thou
   shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal,
   Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there
   be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying,
   namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill
   to his neighbour." Whoever then supposes that the apostle did not
   embrace every man in this precept, is compelled to admit, what is at
   once most absurd and most pernicious, that the apostle thought it no
   sin, if a man were not a Christian or were an enemy, to commit adultery
   with his wife, or to kill him, or to covet his goods. And as nobody but
   a fool would say this, it is clear that every man is to be considered
   our neighbour, because we are to work no ill to any man.

   33. But now, if every one to whom we ought to show, or who ought to
   show to us, the offices of mercy is by right called a neighbour, it is
   manifest that the command to love our neighbour embraces the holy
   angels also, seeing that so great offices of mercy have been performed
   by them on our behalf, as may easily be shown by turning the attention
   to many passages of Holy Scripture. And on this ground even God
   Himself, our Lord, desired to be called our neighbour. For our Lord
   Jesus Christ points to Himself under the figure of the man who brought
   aid to him who was lying half dead on the road, wounded and abandoned
   by the robbers. And the Psalmist says in his prayer, "I behaved myself
   as though he had been my friend or brother." But as the Divine nature
   is of higher excellence than, and far removed above, our nature, the
   command to love God is distinct from that to love our neighbour. For He
   shows us pity on account of His own goodness, but we show pity to one
   another on account of His;--that is, He pities us that we may fully
   enjoy Himself; we pity one another that we may fully enjoy Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 31

   34. And on this ground, when we say that we enjoy only that which we
   love for its own sake, and that nothing is a true object of enjoyment
   except that which makes us happy, and that all other things are for
   use, there seems still to be something that requires explanation. For
   God loves us, and Holy Scripture frequently sets before us the love He
   has towards us. In what way then does He love us? As objects of use or
   as objects of enjoyment? If He enjoys us, He must be in need of good
   from us, and no sane man will say that; for all the good we enjoy is
   either Himself, or what comes from Himself. And no one can be ignorant
   or in doubt as to the fact that the light stands in no need of the
   glitter of the things it has itself lit up. The Psalmist says most
   plainly, "I said to the LORD, Thou art my God, for Thou neediest not my
   goodness." He does not enjoy us then, but makes use of us. For if He
   neither enjoys nor uses us, I am at a loss to discover in what way He
   can love us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 32

   34. But neither does He use after our fashion of using. For when we use
   objects, we do so with a view to the full enjoyment of the goodness of
   God. God, however, in His use of us, has reference to His own goodness.
   For it is because He is good we exist; and so far as we truly exist we
   are good. And, further, because He is also just, we cannot with
   impunity be evil; and so far as we are evil, so far is our existence
   less complete. Now He is the first and supreme existence, who is
   altogether unchangeable, and who could say in the fullest sense of the
   words, "I AM THAT I AM," and "Thou shalt say to them, I AM has sent me
   unto you;" So that all other things that exist, both owe their
   existence entirely to Him, and are good only so far as He has given it
   to them to be so. That use, then, which God is said to make of us has
   no reference to His own advantage, but to ours only; and, so far as He
   is concerned, has reference only to His goodness. When we take pity
   upon a man and care for him, it is for his advantage we do so; but
   somehow or other our own advantage follows by a sort of natural
   consequence, for God does not leave the mercy we show to him who needs
   it to go without reward. Now this is our highest reward, that we should
   fully enjoy Him, and that all who enjoy Him should enjoy one another in
   Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 33

   36. For if we find our happiness complete in one another, we stop short
   upon the road, and place our hope of happiness in man or angel. Now the
   proud man and the proud angel arrogate this to themselves, and are glad
   to have the hope of others fixed upon them. But, on the contrary, the
   holy man and the holy angel, even when we are weary and anxious to stay
   with them and rest in them, set themselves to recruit our energies with
   the provision which they have received of God for us or for themselves;
   and then urge us thus refreshed to go on our way towards Him, in the
   enjoyment of whom we find our common happiness. For even the apostle
   exclaims, "Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name
   of Paul?" And again: "Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he
   that watereth; but God that giveth the increase." And the angel
   admonisheth the man who is about to worship him, that he should rather
   worship Him who is his Master, and under whom he himself is a
   fellow-servant.

   37. But when you have joy of a man in God, it is God rather than man
   that you enjoy. For you enjoy Him by whom you are made happy, and you
   rejoice to have come to Him in whose presence you place your hope of
   joy. And accordingly, Paul says to Philemon, "Yea, brother, let me have
   joy of thee in the Lord." For if he had not added "in the Lord," but
   had only said, "Let me have joy of thee," he would have implied that he
   fixed his hope of happiness upon him, although even in the immediate
   context to "enjoy" is used in the sense of to "use with delight." For
   when the thing that we love is near us, it is a matter of course that
   it should bring delight with it. And if you pass beyond this delight,
   and make it a means to that which you are permanently to rest in, you
   are using it, and it is an abuse of language to say that you enjoy it.
   But if you cling to it, and rest in it, finding your happiness complete
   in it, then you may be truly and properly said to enjoy it. And this we
   must never do except in the case of the Blessed Trinity, who is the
   Supreme and Unchangeable God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 34

   38. And mark that even when He who is Himself the Truth and the Word,
   by whom all things were made, had been made flesh that He might dwell
   among us, the apostle yet says: "Yea, though we have known Christ after
   the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more." For Christ,
   desiring not only to give the possession to those who had completed the
   journey, but also to be Himself the way to those who were just setting
   out, determined to take a fleshly body. Whence also that expression,
   "The Lord created me in the beginning of His way," that is, that those
   who wished to come might begin their journey in Him. The apostle,
   therefore, although still on the way, and following after God who
   called him to the reward of His heavenly calling, yet forgetting those
   things which were behind, and pressing on towards those things which
   were before, had already passed over the beginning of the way, and had
   now no further need of it; yet by this way all must commence their
   journey who desire to attain to the truth, and to rest in eternal life.
   For He says: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life;" that is, by
   me men come, to me they come, in me they rest. For when we come to Him,
   we come to the Father also, because through an equal an equal is known;
   and the Holy Spirit binds, and as it were seals us, so that we are able
   to rest permanently in the supreme and unchangeable God. And hence we
   may learn how essential it is that nothing should detain us on the way,
   when not even our Lord Himself, so far as He has condescended to be our
   way, is willing to detain us, but wishes us rather to press on; and,
   instead of weakly clinging to temporal things, even though these have
   been put on and worn by Him for our salvation, to pass over them
   quickly, and to struggle to attain unto Himself, who has freed our
   nature from the bondage of temporal things, and has set it down at the
   right hand of His Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 35

   39. Of all, then, that has been said since we entered upon the
   discussion about things, this is the sum: that we should clearly
   understand that the fulfilment and the end of the Law, and of all Holy
   Scripture, is the love of an object which is to be enjoyed, and the
   love of an object which can enjoy that other in fellowship with
   ourselves. For there is no need of a command that each man should love
   himself. The whole temporal dispensation for our salvation, therefore,
   was framed by the providence of God that we might know this truth and
   be able to act upon it; and we ought to use that dispensation, not with
   such love and delight as if it were a good to rest in, but with a
   transient feeling rather, such as we have towards the road, or
   carriages, or other things that are merely means. Perhaps some other
   comparison can be found that will more suitably express the idea that
   we are to love the things by which we are borne only for the sake of
   that towards which we are borne.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 36

   40. Whoever, then, thinks that he understands the Holy Scriptures, or
   any part of them, but puts such an interpretation upon them as does not
   tend to build up this twofold love of God and our neighbour, does not
   yet understand them as he ought. If, on the other hand, a man draws a
   meaning from them that may be used for the building up of love, even
   though he does not happen upon the precise meaning which the author
   whom he reads intended to express in that place, his error is not
   pernicious, and he is wholly clear from the charge of deception. For
   there is involved in deception the intention to say what is false; and
   we find plenty of people who intend to deceive, but nobody who wishes
   to be deceived. Since, then, the man who knows practices deceit, and
   the ignorant man is practiced upon, it is quite clear that in any
   particular case the man who is deceived is a better man than he who
   deceives, seeing that it is better to suffer than to commit injustice.
   Now every man who lies commits an injustice; and if any man thinks that
   a lie is ever useful, he must think that injustice is sometimes useful.
   For no liar keeps faith in the matter about which he lies. He wishes,
   of course, that the man to whom he lies should place confidence in him;
   and yet he betrays his confidence by lying to him. Now every man who
   breaks faith is unjust. Either, then, injustice is sometimes useful
   (which is impossible), or a lie is never useful.

   41. Whoever takes another meaning out of Scripture than the writer
   intended, goes astray, but not through any falsehood in Scripture.
   Nevertheless, as I was going to say, if his mistaken interpretation
   tends to build up love, which is the end of the commandment, he goes
   astray in much the same way as a man who by mistake quits the high
   road, but yet reaches through the fields the same place to which the
   road leads. He is to be corrected, however, and to be shown how much
   better it is not to quit the straight road, lest, if he get into a
   habit of going astray, he may sometimes take cross roads, or even go in
   the wrong direction altogether.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 37

   For if he takes up rashly a meaning which the author whom he is reading
   did not intend, he often falls in with other statements which he cannot
   harmonize with this meaning. And if he admits that these statements are
   true and certain, then it follows that the meaning he had put upon the
   former passage cannot be the true one: and so it comes to pass, one can
   hardly tell how, that, out of love for his own opinion, he begins to
   feel more angry with Scripture than he is with himself. And if he
   should once permit that evil to creep in, it will utterly destroy him.
   "For we walk by faith, not by sight." Now faith will totter if the
   authority of Scripture begin to shake. And then, if faith totter, love
   itself will grow cold. For if a man has fallen from faith, he must
   necessarily also fall from love; for he cannot love what he does not
   believe to exist. But if he both believes and loves, then through good
   works, and through diligent attention to the precepts of morality, he
   comes to hope also that he shall attain the object of his love. And so
   these are the three things to which all knowledge and all prophecy are
   subservient: faith, hope, love.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 38

   42. But sight shall displace faith; and hope shall be swallowed up in
   that perfect bliss to which we shall come: love, on the other hand,
   shall wax greater when these others fail. For if we love by faith that
   which as yet we see not, how much more shall we love it when we begin
   to see! And if we love by hope that which as yet we have not reached,
   how much more shall we love it when we reach it! For there is this
   great difference between things temporal and things eternal, that a
   temporal object is valued more before we possess it, and begins to
   prove worthless the moment we attain it, because it does not satisfy
   the soul, which has its only true and sure resting-place in eternity:
   an eternal object, on the other hand, is loved with greater ardour when
   it is in possession than while it is still an object of desire, for no
   one in his longing for it can set a higher value on it than really
   belongs to it, so as to think it comparatively worthless when he finds
   it of less value than he thought; on the contrary, however high the
   value any man may set upon it when he is on his way to possess it, he
   will find it, when it comes into his possession, of higher value still.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 39

   43. And thus a man who is resting upon faith, hope and love, and who
   keeps a firm hold upon these, does not need the Scriptures except for
   the purpose of instructing others. Accordingly, many live without
   copies of the Scriptures, even in solitude, on the strength of these
   three graces. So that in their case, I think, the saying is already
   fulfilled: "Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there
   be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall
   vanish away." Yet by means of these instruments (as they may be
   called), so great an edifice of faith and love has been built up in
   them, that, holding to what is perfect, they do not seek for what is
   only in part perfect--of course, I mean, so far as is possible in this
   life; for, in comparison with the future life, the life of no just and
   holy man is perfect here. Therefore the apostle says: "Now abideth
   faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is
   charity:" because, when a man shall have reached the eternal world,
   while the other two graces will fail, love will remain greater and more
   assured.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 40

   44. And, therefore, if a man fully understands that "the end of the
   commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience,
   and of faith unfeigned," and is bent upon making all his understanding
   of Scripture to bear upon these three graces, he may come to the
   interpretation of these books with an easy mind. For while the apostle
   says "love," he adds "out of a pure heart," to provide against anything
   being loved but that which is worthy of love. And he joins with this "a
   good conscience," in reference to hope; for, if a man has the burthen
   of a bad conscience, he despairs of ever reaching that which he
   believes in and loves. And in the third place he says: "and of faith
   unfeigned." For if our faith is free from all hypocrisy, then we both
   abstain from loving what is unworthy of our love, and by living
   uprightly we are able to indulge the hope that our hope shall not be in
   vain. For these reasons I have been anxious to speak about the objects
   of faith, as far as I thought it necessary for my present purpose; for
   much has already been said on this subject in other volumes, either by
   others or by myself. And so let this be the end of the present book. In
   the next I shall discuss, as far as God shall give me light, the
   subject of signs.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   Having completed his exposition of things, the author now proceeds to
   discuss the subject of signs. He first defines what a sign is, and
   shows that there are two classes of signs, the natural and the
   conventional. Of conventional signs (which are the only class here
   noticed), words are the most numerous and important, and are those with
   which the interpreter of Scripture is chiefly concerned. The
   difficulties and obscurities of Scripture spring chiefly from two
   sources, unknown and ambiguous signs. The present book deals only with
   unknown signs, the ambiguities of language being reserved for treatment
   in the next book. The difficulty arising from ignorance of signs is to
   be removed by learning the Greek and Hebrew languages, in which
   Scripture is written, by comparing the various translations, and by
   attending to the context. In the interpretation of figurative
   expressions, knowledge of things is as necessary as knowledge of words;
   and the various sciences and arts of the heathen, so far as they are
   true and useful, may be turned to account in removing our ignorance of
   signs, whether these be direct or figurative. Whilst exposing the folly
   and futility of many heathen superstitions and practices, the author
   points out how all that is sound and useful in their science and
   philosophy may be turned to a Christian use. And in conclusion, he
   shows the spirit in which it behoves us to address ourselves to the
   study and interpretation of the sacred books.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   1. As when I was writing about things, I introduced the subject with a
   warning against attending to anything but what they are in themselves,
   even though they are signs of something else, so now, when I come in
   its turn to discuss the subject of signs, I lay down this direction,
   not to attend to what they are in themselves, but to the fact that they
   are signs, that is, to what they signify. For a sign is a thing which,
   over and above the impression it makes on the senses, causes something
   else to come into the mind as a consequence of itself: as when we see a
   footprint, we conclude that an animal whose footprint this is has
   passed by; and when we see smoke, we know that there is fire beneath;
   and when we hear the voice of a living man, we think of the feeling in
   his mind; and when the trumpet sounds, soldiers know that they are to
   advance or retreat, or do whatever else the state of the battle
   requires.

   2. Now some signs are natural, others conventional. Natural signs are
   those which, apart from any intention or desire of using them as signs,
   do yet lead to the knowledge of something else, as, for example, smoke
   when it indicates fire. For it is not from any intention of making it a
   sign that it is so, but through attention to experience we come to know
   that fire is beneath, even when nothing but smoke can be seen. And the
   footprint of an animal passing by belongs to this class of signs. And
   the countenance of an angry or sorrowful man indicates the feeling in
   his mind, independently of his will: and in the same way every other
   emotion of the mind is betrayed by the telltale countenance, even
   though we do nothing with the intention of making it known. This class
   of signs however, it is no part of my design to discuss at present. But
   as it comes under this division of the subject, I could not altogether
   pass it over. It will be enough to have noticed it thus far.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   3. Conventional signs, on the other hand, are those which living beings
   mutually exchange for the purpose of showing, as well as they can, the
   feelings of their minds, or their perceptions, or their thoughts. Nor
   is there any reason for giving a sign except the desire of drawing
   forth and conveying into another's mind what the giver of the sign has
   in his own mind. We wish, then, to consider and discuss this class of
   signs so far as men are concerned with it, because even the signs which
   have been given us of God, and which are contained in the Holy
   Scriptures, were made known to us through men--those, namely, who wrote
   the Scriptures. The beasts, too, have certain signs among themselves by
   which they make known the desires in their mind. For when the
   poultry-cock has discovered food, he signals with his voice for the hen
   to run to him, and the dove by cooing calls his mate, or is called by
   her in turn; and many signs of the same kind are matters of common
   observation. Now whether these signs, like the expression or the cry of
   a man in grief, follow the movement of the mind instinctively and apart
   from any purpose, or whether they are really used with the purpose of
   signification, is another question, and does not pertain to the matter
   in hand. And this part of the subject I exclude from the scope of this
   work as not necessary to my present object.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   4. Of the signs, then, by which men communicate their thoughts to one
   another, some relate to the sense of sight, some to that of hearing, a
   very few to the other senses. For, when we nod, we give no sign except
   to the eyes of the man to whom we wish by this sign to impart our
   desire. And some convey a great deal by the motion of the hands: and
   actors by movements of all their limbs give certain signs to the
   initiated, and, so to speak, address their conversation to the eyes:
   and the military standards and flags convey through the eyes the will
   of the commanders. And all these signs are as it were a kind of visible
   words. The signs that address themselves to the ear are, as I have
   said, more numerous, and for the most part consist of words. For though
   the bugle and the flute and the lyre frequently give not only a sweet
   but a significant sound, yet all these signs are very few in number
   compared with words. For among men words have obtained far and away the
   chief place as a means of indicating the thoughts of the mind. Our
   Lord, it is true, gave a sign through the odour of the ointment which
   was poured out upon His feet; and in the sacrament of His body and
   blood He signified His will through the sense of taste; and when by
   touching the hem of His garment the woman was made whole, the act was
   not wanting in significance. But the countless multitude of the signs
   through which men express their thoughts consist of words. For I have
   been able to put into words all those signs, the various classes of
   which I have briefly touched upon, but I could by no effort express
   words in terms of those signs.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   5. But because words pass away as soon as they strike upon the air, and
   last no longer than their sound, men have by means of letters formed
   signs of words. Thus the sounds of the voice are made visible to the
   eye, not of course as sounds, but by means of certain signs. It has
   been found impossible, however, to make those signs common to all
   nations owing to the sin of discord among men, which springs from every
   man trying to snatch the chief place for himself. And that celebrated
   tower which was built to reach to heaven was an indication of this
   arrogance of spirit; and the ungodly men concerned in it justly earned
   the punishment of having not their minds only, but their tongues
   besides, thrown into confusion and discordance.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   6. And hence it happened that even Holy Scripture, which brings a
   remedy for the terrible diseases of the human will, being at first set
   forth in one language, by means of which it could at the fit season be
   disseminated through the whole world, was interpreted into various
   tongues, and spread far and wide, and thus became known to the nations
   for their salvation. And in reading it, men seek nothing more than to
   find out the thought and will of those by whom it was written, and
   through these to find out the will of God, in accordance with which
   they believe these men to have spoken.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   7. But hasty and careless readers are led astray by many and manifold
   obscurities and ambiguities, substituting one meaning for another; and
   in some places they cannot hit upon even a fair interpretation. Some of
   the expressions are so obscure as to shroud the meaning in the thickest
   darkness. And I do not doubt that all this was divinely arranged for
   the purpose of subduing pride by toil, and of preventing a feeling of
   satiety in the intellect, which generally holds in small esteem what is
   discovered without difficulty. For why is it, I ask, that if any one
   says that there are holy and just men whose life and conversation the
   Church of Christ uses as a means of redeeming those who come to it from
   all kinds of superstitions, and making them through their imitation of
   good men members of its own body; men who, as good and true servants of
   God, have come to the baptismal font laying down the burdens of the
   world, and who rising thence do, through the implanting of the Holy
   Spirit, yield the fruit of a twofold love, a love, that is, of God and
   their neighbour;--how is it, I say, that if a man says this, he does
   not please his hearer so much as when he draws the same meaning from
   that passage in Canticles, where it is said of the Church, when it is
   being praised under the figure of a beautiful woman, "Thy teeth are
   like a flock of sheep that are shorn, which came up from the washing,
   whereof every one bears twins, and none is barren among them?" Does the
   hearer learn anything more than when he listens to the same thought
   expressed in the plainest language, without the help of this figure?
   And yet, I don't know why, I feel greater pleasure in contemplating
   holy men, when I view them as the teeth of the Church, tearing men away
   from their errors, and bringing them into the church's body, with all
   their harshness softened down, just as if they had been torn off and
   masticated by the teeth. It is with the greatest pleasure, too, that I
   recognize them under the figure of sheep that have been shorn, laying
   down the burthens of the world like fleeces, and coming up from the
   washing, i.e., from baptism, and all bearing twins, i.e., the twin
   commandments of love, and none among them barren in that holy fruit.

   8. But why I view them with greater delight under that aspect than if
   no such figure were drawn from the sacred books, though the fact would
   remain the same and the knowledge the same, is another question, and
   one very difficult to answer. Nobody, however, has any doubt about the
   facts, both that it is pleasanter in some cases to have knowledge
   communicated through figures and that what is attended with difficulty
   in the seeking gives greater pleasure in the finding.--For those who
   seek but do not find suffer from hunger. Those, again, who do not seek
   at all because they have what they require just beside them often grow
   languid from satiety. Now weakness from either of these causes is to be
   avoided. Accordingly the Holy Spirit has, with admirable wisdom and
   care for our welfare, so arranged the Holy Scriptures as by the plainer
   passages to satisfy our hunger, and by the more obscure to stimulate
   our appetite. For almost nothing is dug out of those obscure passages
   which may not be found set forth in the plainest language elsewhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   9. First of all, then, it is necessary that we should be led by the
   fear of God to seek the knowledge of His will, what He commands us to
   desire and what to avoid. Now this fear will of necessity excite in us
   the thought of our mortality and of the death that is before us, and
   crucify all the motions of pride as if our flesh were nailed to the
   tree. Next it is necessary to have our hearts subdued by piety, and not
   to run in the face of Holy Scripture, whether when understood it
   strikes at some of our sins, or, when not understood, we feel as if we
   could be wiser and give better commands ourselves. We must rather think
   and believe that whatever is there written, even though it be hidden,
   is better and truer than anything we could devise by our own wisdom.

   10. After these two steps of fear and piety, we come to the third step,
   knowledge, of which I have now undertaken to treat. For in this every
   earnest student of the Holy Scriptures exercises himself, to find
   nothing else in them but that God is to be loved for His own sake, and
   our neighbour for God's sake; and that God is to be loved with all the
   heart. and with all the soul, and with all the mind, and one's
   neighbour as one's self--that is, in such a way that all our love for
   our neighbour, like all our love for ourselves, should have reference
   to God. And on these two commandments I touched in the previous book
   when I was treating about things. It is necessary, then, that each man
   should first of all find in the Scriptures that he, through being
   entangled in the love of this world--i.e., of temporal things--has been
   drawn far away from such a love for God and such a love for his
   neighbour as Scripture enjoins. Then that fear which leads him to think
   of the judgment of God, and that piety which gives him no option but to
   believe in and submit to the authority of Scripture, compel him to
   bewail his condition. For the knowledge of a good hope makes a man not
   boastful, but sorrowful. And in this frame of mind he implores with
   unremitting prayers the comfort of the Divine help that he may not be
   overwhelmed in despair, and so he gradually comes to the fourth
   step,--that is, strength and resolution,--in which he hungers and
   thirsts after righteousness. For in this frame of mind he extricates
   himself from every form of fatal joy in transitory things, and turning
   away from these, fixes his affection on things eternal, to wit, the
   unchangeable Trinity in unity.

   11. And when, to the extent of his power, he has gazed upon this object
   shining from afar, and has felt that owing to the weakness of his sight
   he cannot endure that matchless light, then in the fifth step--that is,
   in the counsel of compassion--he cleanses his soul, which is violently
   agitated, and disturbs him with base desires, from the filth it has
   contracted. And at this stage he exercises himself diligently in the
   love of his neighbour; and when he has reached the point of loving his
   enemy, full of hopes and unbroken in strength, he mounts to the sixth
   step, in which he purifies the eye itself which can see God, so far as
   God can be seen by those who as far as possible die to this world. For
   men see Him just so far as they die to this world; and so far as they
   live to it they see Him not. But yet, although that light may begin to
   appear clearer, and not only more tolerable, but even more delightful,
   still it is only through a glass darkly that we are said to see,
   because we walk by faith, not by sight, while we continue to wander as
   strangers in this world, even though our conversation be in heaven. And
   at this stage, too, a man so purges the eye of his affections as not to
   place his neighbour before, or even in comparison with, the truth, and
   therefore not himself, because not him whom he loves as himself.
   Accordingly, that holy man will be so single and so pure in heart, that
   he will not step aside from the truth, either for the sake of pleasing
   men or with a view to avoid any of the annoyances which beset this
   life. Such a son ascends to wisdom which is the seventh and last step,
   and which he enjoys in peace and tranquility. For the fear of God is
   the beginning of wisdom. From that beginning, then, till we reach
   wisdom itself, our way is by the steps now described.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   12. But let us now go back to consider the third step here mentioned,
   for it is about it that I have set myself to speak and reason as the
   Lord shall grant me wisdom. The most skilful interpreter of the sacred
   writings, then, will be he who in the first place has read them all and
   retained them in his knowledge, if not yet with full understanding,
   still with such knowledge as reading gives,--those of them, at least,
   that are called canonical. For he will read the others with greater
   safety when built up in the belief of the truth, so that they will not
   take first possession of a weak mind, nor, cheating it with dangerous
   falsehoods and delusions, fill it with prejudices averse to a sound
   understanding. Now, in regard to the canonical Scriptures, he must
   follow the judgment of the greater number of catholic churches; and
   among these, of course, a high place must be given to such as have been
   thought worthy to be the seat of an apostle and to receive epistles.
   Accordingly, among the canonical Scriptures he will judge according to
   the following standard: to prefer those that are received by all the
   catholic churches to those which some do not receive. Among those,
   again, which are not received by all, he will prefer such as have the
   sanction of the greater number and those of greater authority, to such
   as are held by the smaller number and those of less authority. If,
   however, he shall find that some books are held by the greater number
   of churches, and others by the churches of greater authority (though
   this is not a very likely thing to happen), I think that in such a case
   the authority on the two sides is to be looked upon as equal.

   13. Now the whole canon of Scripture on which we say this judgment is
   to be exercised, is contained in the following books:--Five books of
   Moses, that is, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; one
   book of Joshua the son of Nun; one of Judges; one short book called
   Ruth, which seems rather to belong to the beginning of Kings; next,
   four books of Kings, and two of Chronicles, these last not following
   one another, but running parallel, so to speak, and going over the same
   ground. The books now mentioned are history, which contains a connected
   narrative of the times, and follows the order of the events. There are
   other books which seem to follow no regular order, and are connected
   neither with the order of the preceding books nor with one another,
   such as Job, and Tobias, and Esther, and Judith, and the two books of
   Maccabees, and the two of Ezra, which last look more like a sequel to
   the continuous regular history which terminates with the books of Kings
   and Chronicles. Next are the Prophets, in which there is one book of
   the Psalms of David; and three books of Solomon, viz., Proverbs, Song
   of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. For two books, one called Wisdom and the
   other Ecclesiasticus, are ascribed to Solomon from a certain
   resemblance of style, but the most likely opinion is that they were
   written by Jesus the son of Sirach. Still they are to be reckoned among
   the prophetical books, since they have attained recognition as being
   authoritative. The remainder are the books which are strictly called
   the Prophets: twelve separate books of the prophets which are connected
   with one another, and having never been disjoined, are reckoned as one
   book; the names of these prophets are as follows:--Hosea, Joel, Amos,
   Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah,
   Malachi; then there are the four greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
   Daniel, Ezekiel. The authority of the Old Testament is contained within
   the limits of these forty-four books. That of the New Testament, again,
   is contained within the following:--Four books of the Gospel, according
   to Matthew, according to Mark, according to Luke, according to John;
   fourteen epistles of the Apostle Paul--one to the Romans, two to the
   Corinthians, one to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the
   Philippians, two to the Thessalonians, one to the Colossians, two to
   Timothy, one to Titus, to Philemon, to the Hebrews: two of Peter; three
   of John; one of Jude; and one of James; one book of the Acts of the
   Apostles; and one of the Revelation of John.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   14. In all these books those who fear God and are of a meek and pious
   disposition seek the will of God. And in pursuing this search the first
   rule to be observed is, as I said, to know these books, if not yet with
   the understanding, still to read them so as to commit them to memory,
   or at least so as not to remain wholly ignorant of them. Next, those
   matters that are plainly laid down in them, whether rules of life or
   rules of faith, are to be searched into more carefully and more
   diligently; and the more of these a man discovers, the more capacious
   does his understanding become. For among the things that are plainly
   laid down in Scripture are to be found all matters that concern faith
   and the manner of life,--to wit, hope and love, of which I have spoken
   in the previous book. After this, when we have made ourselves to a
   certain extent familiar with the language of Scripture, we may proceed
   to open up and investigate the obscure passages, and in doing so draw
   examples from the plainer expressions to throw light upon the more
   obscure, and use the evidence of passages about which there is no doubt
   to remove all hesitation in regard to the doubtful passages. And in
   this matter memory counts for a great deal; but if the memory be
   defective, no rules can supply the want.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   15. Now there are two causes which prevent what is written from being
   understood: its being veiled either under unknown, or under ambiguous
   signs. Signs are either proper or figurative. They are called proper
   when they are used to point out the objects they were designed to point
   out, as we say bos when we mean an ox, because all men who with us use
   the Latin tongue call it by this name. Signs are figurative when the
   things themselves which we indicate by the proper names are used to
   signify something else, as we say bos, and understand by that syllable
   the ox, which is ordinarily called by that name; but then further by
   that ox understand a preacher of the gospel, as Scripture signifies,
   according to the apostle's explanation, when it says: "Thou shalt not
   muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   16. The great remedy for ignorance of proper signs is knowledge of
   languages. And men who speak the Latin tongue, of whom are those I have
   undertaken to instruct, need two other languages for the knowledge of
   Scripture, Hebrew and Greek, that they may have recourse to the
   original texts if the endless diversity of the Latin translators throw
   them into doubt. Although, indeed, we often find Hebrew words
   untranslated in the books, as for example, Amen, Hallelujah, Racha,
   Hosanna, and others of the same kind. Some of these, although they
   could have been translated, have been preserved in their original form
   on account of the more sacred authority that attaches to it, as for
   example, Amen and Hallelujah. Some of them, again, are said to be
   untranslatable into another tongue, of which the other two I have
   mentioned are examples. For in some languages there are words that
   cannot be translated into the idiom of another language. And this
   happens chiefly in the case of interjections, which are words that
   express rather an emotion of the mind than any part of a thought we
   have in our mind. And the two given above are said to be of this kind,
   Racha expressing the cry of an angry man, Hosanna that of a joyful man.
   But the knowledge of these languages is necessary, not for the sake of
   a few words like these which it is very easy to mark and to ask about,
   but, as has been said, on account of the diversities among translators.
   For the translations of the Scriptures from Hebrew into Greek can be
   counted, but the Latin translators are out of all number. For in the
   early days of the faith every man who happened to get his hands upon a
   Greek manuscript, and who thought he had any knowledge, were it ever so
   little, of the two languages, ventured upon the work of translation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   17. And this circumstance would assist rather than hinder the
   understanding of Scripture, if only readers were not careless. For the
   examination of a number of texts has often thrown light upon some of
   the more obscure passages; for example, in that passage of the prophet
   Isaiah, one translator reads: "And do not despise the domestics of thy
   seed;" another reads: "And do not despise thine own flesh." Each of
   these in turn confirms the other. For the one is explained by the
   other; because "flesh" may be taken in its literal sense, so that a man
   may understand that he is admonished not to despise his own body; and
   "the domestics of thy seed" may be understood figuratively of
   Christians, because they are spiritually born of the same seed as
   ourselves, namely, the Word. When now the meaning of the two
   translators is compared, a more likely sense of the words suggests
   itself, viz., that the command is not to despise our kinsmen, because
   when one brings the expression "domestics of thy seed " into relation
   with "flesh," kinsmen most naturally occur to one's mind. Whence, I
   think, that expression of the apostle, when he says, "If by any means I
   may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some
   of them;" that is, that through emulation of those who had believed,
   some of them might believe too. And he calls the Jews his "flesh," on
   account of the relationship of blood. Again, that passage from the same
   prophet Isaiah: "If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand,"
   another has translated: "If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide."
   Now which of these is the literal translation cannot be ascertained
   without reference to the text in the original tongue. And yet to those
   who read with knowledge, a great truth is to be found in each. For it
   is difficult for interpreters to differ so widely as not to touch at
   some point. Accordingly here, as understanding consists in sight, and
   is abiding, but faith feeds us as babes, upon milk, in the cradles of
   temporal things (for now we walk by faith, not by sight); as, moreover,
   unless we walk by faith, we shall not attain to sight, which does not
   pass away, but abides, our understanding being purified by holding to
   the truth;--for these reasons one says, "If ye will not believe, ye
   shall not understand;" but the other, "If ye will not believe, ye shall
   not abide."

   18. And very often a translator, to whom the meaning is not well known,
   is deceived by an ambiguity in the original language, and puts upon the
   passage a construction that is wholly alien to the sense of the writer.
   As for example, some texts read: "Their feet are sharp to shed blood;"
   for the word "oxus" among the Greeks means both sharp and swift. And so
   he saw the true meaning who translated: "Their feet are swift to shed
   blood." The other, taking the wrong sense of an ambiguous word, fell
   into error. Now translations such as this are not obscure, but false;
   and there is a wide difference between the two things. For we must
   learn not to interpret, but to correct texts of this sort. For the same
   reason it is, that because the Greek word "moschos" means a calf, some
   have not understood that "moscheumata" are shoots of trees, and have
   translated the word "calves;" and this error has crept into so many
   texts, that you can hardly find it written in any other way. And yet
   the meaning is very clear; for it is made evident by the words that
   follow. For "the plantings of an adulterer will not take deep root," is
   a more suitable form of expression than the "calves;" because these
   walk upon the ground with their feet, and are not fixed in the earth by
   roots. In this passage, indeed, the rest of the context also justifies
   this translation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   19. But since we do not clearly see what the actual thought is which
   the several translators endeavour to express, each according to his own
   ability and judgment, unless we examine it in the language which they
   translate; and since the translator, if he be not a very learned man,
   often departs from the meaning of his author, we must either endeavour
   to get a knowledge of those languages from which the Scriptures are
   translated into Latin, or we must get hold of the translations of those
   who keep rather close to the letter of the original, not because these
   are sufficient, but because we may use them to correct the freedom or
   the error of others, who in their translations have chosen to follow
   the sense quite as much as the words. For not only single words, but
   often whole phrases are translated, which could not be translated at
   all into the Latin idiom by any one who wished to hold by the usage of
   the ancients who spoke Latin. And though these sometimes do not
   interfere with the understanding of the passage, yet they are offensive
   to those who feel greater delight in things when even the signs of
   those things are kept in their own purity. For what is called a
   solecism is nothing else than the putting of words together according
   to a different rule from that which those of our predecessors who spoke
   with any authority followed. For whether we say inter homines (among
   men) or inter hominibus, is of no consequence to a man who only wishes
   to know the facts. And in the same way, what is a barbarism but the
   pronouncing of a word in a different way from that in which those who
   spoke Latin before us pronounced it? For whether the word ignoscere (to
   pardon) should be pronounced with the third syllable long or short, is
   not a matter of much concern to the man who is beseeching God, in any
   way at all that he can get the words out, to pardon his sins. What then
   is purity of speech, except the preserving of the custom of language
   established by the authority of former speakers?

   20. And men are easily offended in a matter of this kind, just in
   proportion as they are weak; and they are weak just in proportion as
   they wish to seem learned, not in the knowledge of things which tend to
   edification, but in that of signs, by which it is hard not to be puffed
   up, seeing that the knowledge of things even would often set up our
   neck, if it were not held down by the yoke of our Master. For how does
   it prevent our understanding it to have the following passage thus
   expressed: "Quae est terra in qua isti insidunt super eam, si bona est
   an nequam; et quae sunt civitates, in quibus ipsi inhabitant in ipsis?"
   (And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad:
   and what cities they be that they dwell in.--Num. 13:19) And I am more
   disposed to think that this is simply the idiom of another language
   than that any deeper meaning is intended. Again, that phrase, which we
   cannot now take away from the lips of the people who sing it: "Super
   ipsum autem floriet sanctificatio mea" (But upon himself shall my
   holiness flourish--Ps.132:18), surely takes away nothing from the
   meaning. Yet a more learned man would prefer that this should be
   corrected, and that we should say, not floriet, but florebit. Nor does
   anything stand in the way of the correction being made, except the
   usage of the singers. Mistakes of this kind, then, if a man do not
   choose to avoid them altogether, it is easy to treat with indifference,
   as not interfering with a right understanding. But take, on the other
   hand, the saying of the apostle: "Quod stultum est Dei, sapientius est
   hominibus, et quod infirmum est Dei, fortius est hominibus" (Because
   the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is
   stronger than men--1 Cor.1:25). If any one should retain in this
   passage the Greek idiom, and say, "Quod stultum est Dei, sapientius est
   hominum et quo infirmum est Dei fortius est hominum" (What is foolish
   of God is wiser of men, and what is weak of God is stronger of men), a
   quick and careful reader would indeed by an effort attain to the true
   meaning, but still a man of slower intelligence either would not
   understand it at all, or would put an utterly false construction upon
   it. For not only is such a form of speech faulty in the Latin tongue,
   but it is ambiguous too, as if the meaning might be, that the folly of
   men or the weakness of men is wiser or stronger than that of God. But
   indeed even the expression "sapientius est hominibus" (stronger than
   men) is not free from ambiguity, even though it be free from solecism.
   For whether "hominibus" is put as the plural of the dative or as the
   plural of the ablative, does not appear, unless by reference to the
   meaning. It would be better then to say, "sapientius est quam homines",
   and "fortius est quam homines".
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   21. About ambiguous signs, however, I shall speak afterwards. I am
   treating at present of unknown signs, of which, as far as the words are
   concerned, there are two kinds. For either a word or an idiom, of which
   the reader is ignorant, brings him to a stop. Now if these belong to
   foreign tongues, we must either make inquiry about them from men who
   speak those tongues, or if we have leisure we must learn the tongues
   ourselves, or we must consult and compare several translators. If,
   however, there are words or idioms in our own tongue that we are
   unacquainted with, we gradually come to know them through being
   accustomed to read or to hear them. There is nothing that it is better
   to commit to memory than those kinds of words and phrases whose meaning
   we do not know, so that where we happen to meet either with a more
   learned man of whom we can inquire, or with a passage that shows,
   either by the preceding or succeeding context, or by both, the force
   and significance of the phrase we are ignorant of, we can easily by the
   help of our memory turn our attention to the matter and learn all about
   it. So great, however, is the force of custom, even in regard to
   learning, that those who have been in a sort of way nurtured and
   brought up on the study of Holy Scripture, are surprised at other forms
   of speech, and think them less pure Latin than those which they have
   learnt from Scripture, but which are not to be found in Latin authors.
   In this matter, too, the great number of the translators proves a very
   great assistance, if they are examined and discussed with a careful
   comparison of their texts. Only all positive error must be removed. For
   those who are anxious to know the Scriptures ought in the first place
   to use their skill in the correction of the texts, so that the
   uncorrected ones should give way to the corrected, at least when they
   are copies of the same translation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   22. Now among translations themselves the Italian (Itala) is to be
   preferred to the others, for it keeps closer to the words without
   prejudice to clearness of expression. And to correct the Latin we must
   use the Greek versions, among which the authority of the Septuagint is
   preeminent as far as the Old Testament is concerned; for it is reported
   through all the more learned churches that the seventy translators
   enjoyed so much of the presence and power of the Holy Spirit in their
   work of translation, that among that number of men there was but one
   voice. And if, as is reported, and as many not unworthy of confidence
   assert, they were separated during the work of translation, each man
   being in a cell by himself, and yet nothing was found in the manuscript
   of any one of them that was not found in the same words and in the same
   order of words in all the rest, who dares put anything in comparison
   with an authority like this, not to speak of preferring anything to it?
   And even if they conferred together with the result that a unanimous
   agreement sprang out of the common labour and judgment of them all;
   even so, it would not be right or becoming for any one man, whatever
   his experience, to aspire to correct the unanimous opinion of many
   venerable and learned men. Wherefore, even if anything is found in the
   original Hebrew in a different form from that in which these men have
   expressed it, I think we must give way to the dispensation of
   Providence which used these men to bring it about, that books which the
   Jewish race were unwilling, either from religious scruple or from
   jealousy, to make known to other nations, were, with the assistance of
   the power of King Ptolemy, made known so long beforehand to the nations
   which in the future were to believe in the Lord. And thus it is
   possible that they translated in such a way as the Holy Spirit, who
   worked in them and had given them all one voice, thought most suitable
   for the Gentiles. But nevertheless, as I said above, a comparison of
   those translators also who have kept most closely to the words, is
   often not without value as a help to the clearing up of the meaning.
   The Latin texts, therefore, of the Old Testament are, as I was about to
   say, to be corrected if necessary by the authority of the Greeks, and
   especially by that of those who, though they were seventy in number,
   are said to have translated as with one voice. As to the books of the
   New Testament, again, if any perplexity arises from the diversities of
   the Latin texts, we must of course yield to the Greek, especially those
   that are found in the churches of greater learning and research.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   23. In the case of figurative signs, again, if ignorance of any of them
   should chance to bring the reader to a standstill, their meaning is to
   be traced partly by the knowledge of languages, partly by the knowledge
   of things. The pool of Siloam, for example, where the man whose eyes
   our Lord had anointed with clay made out of spittle was commanded to
   wash, has a figurative significance, and undoubtedly conveys a secret
   sense; but yet if the evangelist had not interpreted that name, a
   meaning so important would lie unnoticed. And we cannot doubt that, in
   the same way, many Hebrew names which have not been interpreted by the
   writers of those books, would, if any one could interpret them, be of
   great value and service in solving the enigmas of Scripture. And a
   number of men skilled in that language have conferred no small benefit
   on posterity by explaining all these words without reference to their
   place in Scripture, and telling us what Adam means, what Eve, what
   Abraham, what Moses, and also the names of places, what Jerusalem
   signifies, or Sion, or Sinai, or Lebanon, or Jordan, and whatever other
   names in that language we are not acquainted with. And when these names
   have been investigated and explained, many figurative expressions in
   Scripture become clear.

   24. Ignorance of things, too, renders figurative expressions obscure,
   as when we do not know the nature of the animals, or minerals, or
   plants, which are frequently referred to in Scripture by way of
   comparison. The fact so well known about the serpent, for example, that
   to protect its head it will present its whole body to its
   assailants--how much light it throws upon the meaning of our Lord's
   command, that we should be wise as serpents; that is to say, that for
   the sake of our head, which is Christ, we should willingly offer our
   body to the persecutors, lest the Christian faith should, as it were,
   be destroyed in us, if to save the body we deny our God! Or again, the
   statement that the serpent gets rid of its old skin by squeezing itself
   through a narrow hole, and thus acquires new strength--how
   appropriately it fits in with the direction to imitate the wisdom of
   the serpent, and to put off the old man, as the apostle says, that we
   may put on the new; and to put it off, too, by coming through a narrow
   place, according to the saying of our Lord, "Enter ye in at the strait
   gate!" As, then, knowledge of the nature of the serpent throws light
   upon many metaphors which Scripture is accustomed to draw from that
   animal, so ignorance of other animals, which are no less frequently
   mentioned by way of comparison, is a very great drawback to the reader.
   And so in regard to minerals and plants: knowledge of the carbuncle,
   for instance, which shines in the dark, throws light upon many of the
   dark places in books too, where it is used metaphorically; and
   ignorance of the beryl or the adamant often shuts the doors of
   knowledge. And the only reason why we find it easy to understand that
   perpetual peace is indicated by the olive branch which the dove brought
   with it when it returned to the ark, is that we know both that the
   smooth touch of olive oil is not easily spoiled by a fluid of another
   kind, and that the tree itself is an evergreen. Many, again, by reason
   of their ignorance of hyssop, not knowing the virtue it has in
   cleansing the lungs, nor the power it is said to have of piercing rocks
   with its roots, although it is a small and insignificant plant, cannot
   make out why it is said, Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean".

   25. Ignorance of numbers, too, prevents us from understanding things
   that are set down in Scripture in a figurative and mystical way. A
   candid mind, if I may so speak, cannot but be anxious, for example, to
   ascertain what is meant by the fact that Moses and Elijah, and our Lord
   Himself, all fasted for forty days. And except by knowledge of and
   reflection upon the number, the difficulty of explaining the figure
   involved in this action cannot be got over. For the number contains ten
   four times, indicating the knowledge of all things, and that knowledge
   interwoven with time. For both the diurnal and the annual revolutions
   are accomplished in periods numbering four each; the diurnal in the
   hours of the morning, the noontime, the evening, and the night; the
   annual in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter months. Now while we
   live in time, we must abstain and fast from all joy in time, for the
   sake of that eternity in which we wish to live; although by the passage
   of time we are taught this very lesson of despising time and seeking
   eternity. Further, the number ten signifies the knowledge of the
   Creator and the creature, for there is a trinity in the Creator; and
   the number seven indicates the creature, because of the life and the
   body. For the life consists of three parts, whence also God is to be
   loved with the whole heart, the whole soul, and the whole mind; and it
   is very clear that in the body there are four elements of which it is
   made up. In this number ten, therefore, when it is placed before us in
   connection with time, that is, when it is taken four times, we are
   admonished to live unstained by, and not partaking of, any delight in
   time, that is, to fast for forty days. Of this we are admonished by the
   law personified in Moses, by prophecy personified in Elijah, and by our
   Lord Himself, who, as if receiving the witness both of the law and the
   prophets, appeared on the mount between the other two, while His three
   disciples looked on in amazement. Next, we have to inquire in the same
   way, how out of the number forty springs the number fifty, which in our
   religion has no ordinary sacredness attached to it on account of the
   Pentecost, and how this number taken thrice on account of the three
   divisions of time, before the law, under the law, and under grace, or
   perhaps on account of the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and
   the Trinity itself being added over and above, has reference to the
   mystery of the most Holy Church, and reaches to the number of the one
   hundred and fifty-three fishes which were taken after the resurrection
   of our Lord, when the nets were cast out on the right-hand side of the
   boat. And in the same way, many other numbers and combinations of
   numbers are used in the sacred writings, to convey instruction under a
   figurative guise, and ignorance of numbers often shuts out the reader
   from this instruction.

   26. Not a few things, too, are closed against us and obscured by
   ignorance of music. One man, for example, has not unskilfully explained
   some metaphors from the difference between the psalters and the harp.
   And it is a question which it is not out of place for learned men to
   discuss, whether there is any musical law that compels the psalters of
   ten chords to have just so many strings; or whether, if there be no
   such law, the number itself is not on that very account the more to be
   considered as of sacred significance, either with reference to the ten
   commandments of the law (and if again any question is raised about that
   number, we can only refer it to the Creator and the creature), or with
   reference to the number ten itself as interpreted above. And the number
   of years the temple was in building, which is mentioned in the
   gospel--viz., forty-six--has a certain undefinable musical sound, and
   when referred to the structure of our Lord's body, in relation to which
   the temple was mentioned, compels many heretics to confess that our
   Lord put on, not a false, but a true and human body. And in several
   places in the Holy Scriptures we find both numbers and music mentioned
   with honour.

  Chapter 17

   27. For we must not listen to the falsities of heathen superstition,
   which represent the nine Muses as daughters of Jupiter and Mercury.
   Varro refutes these, and I doubt whether any one can be found among
   them more curious or more learned in such matters. He says that a
   certain state (I don't recollect the name) ordered from each of three
   artists a set of statues of the Muses, to be placed as an offering in
   the temple of Apollo, intending that whichever of the artists produced
   the most beautiful statues, they should select and purchase from him.
   It so happened that these artists executed their works with equal
   beauty, that all nine pleased the state, and that all were bought to be
   dedicated in the temple of Apollo; and he says that afterwards Hesiod
   the poet gave names to them all. It was not Jupiter, therefore, that
   begat the nine Muses, but three artists created three each. And the
   state had originally given the order for three, not because it had seen
   them in visions, nor because they had presented themselves in that
   number to the eyes of any of the citizens, but because it was obvious
   to remark that all sound, which is the material of song, is by nature
   of three kinds. For it is either produced by the voice, as in the case
   of those who sing with the mouth without an instrument; or by blowing,
   as in the case of trumpets and flutes; or by striking, as in the case
   of harps and drums, and all other instruments that give their sound
   when struck.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 18

   28. But whether the fact is as Varro has related, or is not so, still
   we ought not to give up music because of the superstition of the
   heathen, if we can derive anything from it that is of use for the
   understanding of Holy Scripture; nor does it follow that we must busy
   ourselves with their theatrical trumpery because we enter upon an
   investigation about harps and other instruments, that may help us to
   lay hold upon spiritual things. For we ought not to refuse to learn
   letters because they say that Mercury discovered them; nor because they
   have dedicated temples to Justice and Virtue, and prefer to worship in
   the form of stones things that ought to have their place in the heart,
   ought we on that account to forsake justice and virtue. Nay, but let
   every good and true Christian understand that wherever truth may be
   found, it belongs to his Master; and while he recognizes and
   acknowledges the truth, even in their religious literature, let him
   reject the figments of superstition, and let him grieve over and avoid
   men who, "when they knew God, glorified him not as God, neither were
   thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
   heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became
   fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image
   made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and
   creeping things."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   29. But to explain more fully this whole topic (for it is one that
   cannot be omitted), there are two kinds of knowledge which are in vogue
   among the heathen. One is the knowledge of things instituted by men,
   the other of things which they have noted, either as transacted in the
   past or as instituted by God. The former kind, that which deals with
   human institutions, is partly superstitious, partly not.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 20

   30. All the arrangements made by men to the making and worshipping of
   idols are superstitious, pertaining as they do either to the worship of
   what is created or of some part of it as God, or to consultations and
   arrangements about signs and leagues with devils, such, for example, as
   are employed in the magical arts, and which the poets are accustomed
   not so much to teach as to celebrate. And to this class belong, but
   with a bolder reach of deception, the books of the haruspices and
   augurs. In this class we must place also all amulets and cures which
   the medical art condemns, whether these consist in incantations, or in
   marks which they call characters, or in hanging or tying on or even
   dancing in a fashion certain articles, not with reference to the
   condition of the body, but to certain signs hidden or manifest; and
   these remedies they call by the less offensive name of physica, so as
   to appear not to be engaged in superstitious observances, but to be
   taking advantage of the forces of nature. Examples of these are the
   earrings on the top of each ear, or the rings of ostrich bone on the
   fingers, or telling you when you hiccup to hold your left thumb in your
   right hand.

   31. To these we may add thousands of the most frivolous practices, that
   are to be observed if any part of the body should jump, or if, when
   friends are walking arm-in-arm, a stone, or a dog, or a boy, should
   come between them. And the kicking of a stone, as if it were a divider
   of friends, does less harm than to cuff an innocent boy if he happens
   to run between men who are walking side by side. But it is delightful
   that the boys are sometimes avenged by the dogs; for frequently men are
   so superstitious as to venture upon striking a dog who has run between
   them,--not with impunity however, for instead of a superstitious
   remedy, the dog sometimes makes his assailant run in hot haste for a
   real surgeon. To this class, too, belong the following rules: To tread
   upon the threshold when you go out in front of the house; to go back to
   bed if any one should sneeze when you are putting on your slippers; to
   return home if you stumble when going to a place; when your clothes are
   eaten by mice, to be more frightened at the prospect of coming
   misfortune than grieved by your present loss. Whence that witty saying
   of Cato, who, when consulted by a man who told him that the mice had
   eaten his boots, replied, "That is not strange, but it would have been
   very strange indeed if the boots had eaten the mice."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 21

   32. Nor can we exclude from this kind of superstition those who were
   called genethliaci, on account of their attention to birthdays, but are
   now commonly called mathematici. For these, too, although they may seek
   with pains for the true position of the stars at the time of our birth,
   and may sometimes even find it out, yet in so far as they attempt
   thence to predict our actions, or the consequences of our actions,
   grievously err, and sell inexperienced men into a miserable bondage.
   For when any freeman goes to an astrologer of this kind, he gives money
   that he may come away the slave either of Mars or of Venus, or rather,
   perhaps, of all the stars to which those who first fell into this
   error, and handed it on to posterity, have given the names either of
   beasts on account of their likeness to beasts, or of men with a view to
   confer honour on those men. And this is not to be wondered at, when we
   consider that even in times more recent and nearer our own, the Romans
   made an attempt to dedicate the star which we call Lucifer to the name
   and honour of Caesar. And this would, perhaps, have been done, and the
   name handed down to distant ages, only that his ancestress Venus had
   given her name to this star before him, and could not by any law
   transfer to her heirs what she had never possessed, nor sought to
   possess, in life. For where a place was vacant, or not held in honour
   of any of the dead of former times, the usual proceeding in such cases
   was carried out. For example, we have changed the names of the months
   Quintilis and Sextilis to July and August, naming them in honour of the
   men Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar; and from this instance any one
   who cares can easily see that the stars spoken of above formerly
   wandered in the heavens without the names they now bear. But as the men
   were dead whose memory people were either compelled by royal power or
   impelled by human folly to honour, they seemed to think that in putting
   their names upon the stars they were raising the dead men themselves to
   heaven. But whatever they may be called by men, still there are stars
   which God has made and set in order after His own pleasure, and they
   have a fixed movement, by which the seasons are distinguished and
   varied. And when any one is born, it is easy to observe the point at
   which this movement has arrived, by use of the rules discovered and
   laid down by those who are rebuked by Holy Writ in these terms: "For if
   they were able to know so much that they could weigh the world, how did
   they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 22

   33. But to desire to predict the characters, the acts, and the fate of
   those who are born from such an observation, is a great delusion and
   great madness. And among those at least who have any sort of
   acquaintance with matters of this kind (which, indeed, are only fit to
   be unlearnt again), this superstition is refuted beyond the reach of
   doubt. For the observation is of the position of the stars, which they
   call constellations, at the time when the person was born about whom
   these wretched men are consulted by their still more wretched dupes.
   Now it may happen that, in the case of twins, one follows the other out
   of the womb so closely that there is no interval of time between them
   that can be apprehended and marked in the position of the
   constellations. Whence it necessarily follows that twins are in many
   cases born under the same stars, while they do not meet with equal
   fortune either in what they do or what they suffer, but often meet with
   fates so different that one of them has a most fortunate life, the
   other a most unfortunate. As, for example, we are told that Esau and
   Jacob were born twins, and in such close succession, that Jacob, who
   was born last, was found to have laid hold with his hand upon the heel
   of his brother, who preceded him. Now, assuredly, the day and hour of
   the birth of these two could not be marked in any way that would not
   give both the same constellation. But what a difference there was
   between the characters, the actions, the labours, and the fortunes of
   these two, the Scriptures bear witness, which are now so widely spread
   as to be in the mouth of all nations.

   34. Nor is it to the point to say that the very smallest and briefest
   moment of time that separates the birth of twins, produces great
   effects in nature, and in the extremely rapid motion of the heavenly
   bodies. For, although I may grant that it does produce the greatest
   effects, yet the astrologer cannot discover this in the constellations,
   and it is by looking into these that he professes to read the fates.
   If, then, he does not discover the difference when he examines the
   constellations, which must, of course, be the same whether he is
   consulted about Jacob or his brother, what does it profit him that
   there is a difference in the heavens, which he rashly and carelessly
   brings into disrepute, when there is no difference in his chart, which
   he looks into anxiously but in vain? And so these notions also, which
   have their origin in certain signs of things being arbitrarily fixed
   upon by the presumption of men, are to be referred to the same class as
   if they were leagues and covenants with devils.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 23

   35. For in this way it comes to pass that men who lust after evil
   things are, by a secret judgment of God, delivered over to be mocked
   and deceived, as the just reward of their evil desires. For they are
   deluded and imposed on by the false angels, to whom the lowest part of
   the world has been put in subjection by the law of God's providence,
   and in accordance with His most admirable arrangement of things. And
   the result of these delusions and deceptions is, that through these
   superstitious and baneful modes of divination, many things in the past
   and future are made known, and turn out just as they are foretold; and
   in the case of those who practice superstitious observances, many
   things turn out agreeably to their observances, and ensnared by these
   successes, they become more eagerly inquisitive, and involve themselves
   further and further in a labyrinth of most pernicious error. And to our
   advantage, the Word of God is not silent about this species of
   fornication of the soul; and it does not warn the soul against
   following such practices on the ground that those who profess them
   speak lies, but it says, "Even if what they tell you should come to
   pass, hearken not unto them." For though the ghost of the dead Samuel
   foretold the truth to King Saul, that does not make such sacrilegious
   observances as those by which his ghost was brought up the less
   detestable; and though the ventriloquist woman in the Acts of the
   Apostles bore true testimony to the apostles of the Lord, the Apostle
   Paul did not spare the evil spirit on that account, but rebuked and
   cast it out, and so made the woman clean.

   36. All arts of this sort, therefore, are either nullities, or are part
   of a guilty superstition, springing out of a baleful fellowship between
   men and devils, and are to be utterly repudiated and avoided by the
   Christian as the covenants of a false and treacherous friendship. Not
   as if the idol were anything," says the apostle; "but because the
   things which they sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God;
   and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils." Now what
   the apostle has said about idols and the sacrifices offered in their
   honour, that we ought to feel in regard to all fancied signs which lead
   either to the worship of idols, or to worshipping creation or its parts
   instead of God, or which are connected with attention to medicinal
   charms and other observances; for these are not appointed by God as the
   public means of promoting love towards God and our neighbour, but they
   waste the hearts of wretched men in private and selfish strivings after
   temporal things. Accordingly, in regard to all these branches of
   knowledge, we must fear and shun the fellowship of demons, who, with
   the Devil their prince, strive only to shut and bar the door against
   our return. As, then, from the stars which God created and ordained,
   men have drawn lying omens of their own fancy, so also from things that
   are born, or in any other way come into existence under the government
   of God's providence, if there chance only to be something unusual in
   the occurrence,--as when a mule brings forth young, or an object is
   struck by lightning,--men have frequently drawn omens by conjectures of
   their own, and have committed them to writing, as if they had drawn
   them by rule.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 24

   37. And all these omens are of force just so far as has been arranged
   with the devils by that previous understanding in the mind which is, as
   it were, the common language, but they are all full of hurtful
   curiosity, torturing anxiety, and deadly slavery. For it was not
   because they had meaning that they were attended to, but it was by
   attending to and marking them that they came to have meaning. And so
   they are made different for different people, according to their
   several notions and prejudices. For those spirits which are bent upon
   deceiving, take care to provide for each person the same sort of omens
   as they see his own conjectures and preconceptions have already
   entangled him in. For, to take an illustration, the same figure of the
   letter X, which is made in the shape of a cross, means one thing among
   the Greeks and another among the Latins, not by nature, but by
   agreement and prearrangement as to its signification; and so, any one
   who knows both languages uses this letter in a different sense when
   writing to a Greek from that in which he uses it when writing to a
   Latin. And the same sound, beta, which is the name of a letter among
   the Greeks, is the name of a vegetable among the Latins; and when I
   say, lege, these two syllables mean one thing to a Greek and another to
   a Latin. Now, just as all these signs affect the mind according to the
   arrangements of the community in which each man lives, and affect
   different men's minds differently, because these arrangements are
   different; and as, further, men did not agree upon them as signs
   because they were already significant, but on the contrary they are now
   significant because men have agreed upon them; in the same way also,
   those signs by which the ruinous intercourse with devils is maintained
   have meaning just in proportion to each man's observations. And this
   appears quite plainly in the rites of the augurs; for they, both before
   they observe the omens and after they have completed their
   observations, take pains not to see the flight or hear the cries of
   birds, because these omens are of no significance apart from the
   previous arrangement in the mind of the observer.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 25

   38. But when all these have been cut away and rooted out of the mind of
   the Christian, we must then look at human institutions which are not
   superstitious, that is, such as are not set up in association with
   devils, but by men in association with one another. For all
   arrangements that are in force among men, because they have agreed
   among themselves that they should be in force, are human institutions;
   and of these, some are matters of superfluity and luxury, some of
   convenience and necessity. For if those signs which the actors make in
   dancing were of force by nature, and not by the arrangement and
   agreement of men, the public crier would not in former times have
   announced to the people of Carthage, while the pantomime was dancing,
   what it was he meant to express,--a thing still remembered by many old
   men from whom we have frequently heard it. And we may well believe
   this, because even now, if any one who is unaccustomed to such follies
   goes into the theatre, unless some one tells him what these movements
   mean, he will give his whole attention to them in vain. Yet all men aim
   at a certain degree of likeness in their choice of signs, that the
   signs may as far as possible be like the things they signify. But
   because one thing may resemble another in many ways, such signs are not
   always of the same significance among men, except when they have
   mutually agreed upon them.

   39. But in regard to pictures and statues, and other works of this
   kind, which are intended as representations of things, nobody makes a
   mistake, especially if they are executed by skilled artists, but every
   one, as soon as he sees the likenesses recognizes the things they are
   likenesses of. And this whole class are to be reckoned among the
   superfluous devices of men, unless when it is a matter of importance to
   inquire in regard to any of them, for what reason, where, when, and by
   whose authority it was made. Finally, the thousands of fables and
   fictions, in whose lies men take delight, are human devices, and
   nothing is to be considered more peculiarly man's own and derived from
   himself than, anything that is false and lying. Among the convenient
   and necessary arrangements of men with men are to be reckoned whatever
   differences they choose to make in bodily dress and ornament for the
   purpose of distinguishing sex or rank; and the countless varieties of
   signs without which human intercourse either could not be carried on at
   all, or would be carried on at great inconvenience; and the
   arrangements as to weights and measures, and the stamping and weighing
   of coins, which are peculiar to each state and people, and other things
   of the same kind. Now these, if they were not devices of men, would not
   be different in different nations, and could not be changed among
   particular nations at the discretion of their respective sovereigns.

   40. This whole class of human arrangements, which are of convenience
   for the necessary intercourse of life, the Christian is not by any
   means to neglect, but on the contrary should pay a sufficient degree of
   attention to them, and keep them in memory.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 26

   For certain institutions of men are in a sort of way representations
   and likenesses of natural objects. And of these, such as have relation
   to fellowship with devils must, as has been said, be utterly rejected
   and held in detestation; those, on the other hand, which relate to the
   mutual intercourse of men, are, so far as they are not matters of
   luxury and superfluity, to be adopted, especially the forms of the
   letters which are necessary for reading, and the various languages as
   far as is required--a matter I have spoken of above. To this class also
   belong shorthand characters, those who are acquainted with which are
   called shorthand writers. All these are useful, and there is nothing
   unlawful in learning them, nor do they involve us in superstition, or
   enervate us by luxury, if they only occupy our minds so far as not to
   stand in the way of more important objects to which they ought to be
   subservient.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 27

   41. But, coming to the next point, we are not to reckon among human
   institutions those things which men have handed down to us, not as
   arrangements of their own, but as the resell of investigation into the
   occurrences of the past, and into the arrangements of God's providence.
   And of these, some pertain to the bodily senses, some to the intellect.
   Those which are reached by the bodily senses we either believe on
   testimony, or perceive when they are pointed out to us, or infer from
   experience.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 28

   42. Anything, then, that we learn from history about the chronology of
   past times assists us very much in understanding the Scriptures, even
   if it be learnt without the pale of the Church as a matter of childish
   instruction. For we frequently seek information about a variety of
   matters by use of the Olympiads, and the names of the consuls; and
   ignorance of the consulship in which our Lord was born, and that in
   which He suffered, has led some into the error of supposing that He was
   forty-six years of age when He suffered, that being the number of years
   He was told by the Jews the temple (which He took as a symbol of His
   body) was in building. Now we know on the authority of the evangelist
   that He was about thirty years of age when He was baptized; but the
   number of years He lived afterwards, although by putting His actions
   together we can make it out, yet that no shadow of doubt might arise
   from another source, can be ascertained more clearly and more certainly
   from a comparison of profane history with the gospel. It will still be
   evident, however, that it was not without a purpose it was said that
   the temple was forty and six years in building; so that, as this cannot
   be referred to our Lord's age, it may be referred to the more secret
   formation of the body which, for our sakes, the only begotten Son of
   God, by whom all things were made, condescended to put on.

   43. As to the utility of history, moreover, passing over the Greeks,
   what a great question our own Ambrose has set at rest! For, when the
   readers and admirers of Plato dared calumniously to assert that our
   Lord Jesus Christ learnt all those sayings of His, which they are
   compelled to admire and praise, from the books of Plato--because (they
   urged) it cannot be denied that Plato lived long before the coming of
   our Lord!--did not the illustrious bishop, when by his investigations
   into profane history he had discovered that Plato made a journey into
   Egypt at the time when Jeremiah the prophet was there, show that it is
   much more likely that Plato was through Jeremiah's means initiated into
   our literature, so as to be able to teach and write those views of his
   which are so justly praised? For not even Pythagoras himself, from
   whose successors these men assert Plato learnt theology, lived at a
   date prior to the books of that Hebrew race, among whom the worship of
   one God sprang up, and of whom as concerning the flesh our Lord came.
   And thus, when we reflect upon the dates, it becomes much more probable
   that those philosophers learnt whatever they said that was good and
   true from our literature, than that the Lord Jesus Christ learnt from
   the writings of Plato,--a thing which it is the height of folly to
   believe.

   44. And even when in the course of an historical narrative former
   institutions of men are described, the history itself is not to be
   reckoned among human institutions; because things that are past and
   gone and cannot be undone are to be reckoned as belonging to the course
   of time, of which God is the author and governor. For it is one thing
   to tell what has been done, another to show what ought to be done.
   History narrates what has been done, faithfully and with advantage; but
   the books of the haruspices, and all writings of the same kind, aim at
   teaching what ought to be done or observed, using the boldness of an
   adviser, not the fidelity of a narrator.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 29

   45. There is also a species of narrative resembling description, in
   which not a past but an existing state of things is made known to those
   who are ignorant of it. To this species belongs all that has been
   written about the situation of places, and the nature of animals,
   trees, herbs, stones, and other bodies. And of this species I have
   treated above, and have shown that this kind of knowledge is
   serviceable in solving the difficulties of Scripture, not that these
   objects are to be used conformably to certain signs as nostrums or the
   instruments of superstition; for that kind of knowledge I have already
   set aside as distinct from the lawful and free kind now spoken of. For
   it is one thing to say: If you bruise down this herb and drink it, it
   will remove the pain from your stomach; and another to say: If you hang
   this herb round your neck, it will remove the pain from your stomach.
   In the former case the wholesome mixture is approved of, in the latter
   the superstitious charm is condemned; although indeed, where
   incantations and invocations and marks are not used, it is frequently
   doubtful whether the thing that is tied or fixed in any way to the body
   to cure it, acts by a natural virtue, in which case it may be freely
   used; or acts by a sort of charm, in which case it becomes the
   Christian to avoid it the more carefully, the more efficacious it may
   seem to be. But when the reason why a thing is of virtue does not
   appear, the intention with which it is used is of great importance, at
   least in healing or in tempering bodies, whether in medicine or in
   agriculture.

   46. The knowledge of the stars, again, is not a matter of narration,
   but of description. Very few of these, however, are mentioned in
   Scripture. And as the course of the moon, which is regularly employed
   in reference to celebrating the anniversary of our Lord's passion, is
   known to most people; so the rising and setting and other movements of
   the rest of the heavenly bodies are thoroughly known to very few. And
   this knowledge, although in itself it involves no superstition, renders
   very little, indeed almost no assistance, in the interpretation of Holy
   Scripture, and by engaging the attention unprofitably is a hindrance
   rather; and as it is closely related to the very pernicious error of
   the diviners of the fates, it is more convenient and becoming to
   neglect it. it involves, moreover, in addition to a description of the
   present state of things, something like a narrative of the past also;
   because one may go back from the present position and motion of the
   stars, and trace by rule their past movements. It involves also regular
   anticipations of the future, not in the way of forebodings and omens,
   but by way of sure calculation; not with the design of drawing any
   information from them as to our own acts and fates, in the absurd
   fashion of the genethliaci, but only as to the motions of the heavenly
   bodies themselves. For, as the man who computes the moon's age can
   tell, when he has found out her age today, what her age was any number
   of years ago, or what will be her age any number of years hence, in
   just the same way men who are skilled in such computations are
   accustomed to answer like questions about every one of the heavenly
   bodies. And I have stated what my views are about all this knowledge,
   so far as regards its utility.

   47. Further, as to the remaining arts, whether those by which something
   is made which, when the effort of the workman is over, remains as a
   result of his work, as, for example, a house, a bench, a dish, and
   other things of that kind; or those which, so to speak, assist God in
   His operations, as medicine, and agriculture, and navigation: or those
   whose sole result is an action, as dancing, and racing, and
   wrestling;--in all these arts experience teaches us to infer the future
   from the past. For no man who is skilled in any of these arts moves his
   limbs in any operation without connecting the memory of the past with
   the expectation of the future. Now of these arts a very superficial and
   cursory knowledge is to be acquired, not with a view to practicing them
   (unless some duty compel us, a matter on which I do not touch at
   present), but with a view to forming a judgement about them, that we
   may not be wholly ignorant of what Scripture means to convey when it
   employs figures of speech derived from these arts.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 31

   48. There remain those branches of knowledge which pertain not to the
   bodily senses, but to the intellect, among which the science of
   reasoning and that of number are the chief. The science of reasoning is
   of very great service in searching into and unravelling all sorts of
   questions that come up in Scripture, only in the use of it we must
   guard against the love of wrangling, and the childish vanity of
   entrapping an adversary. For there are many of what are called
   sophisms, inferences in reasoning that are false, and yet so close an
   imitation of the true, as to deceive not only dull people, but clever
   men too, when they are not on their guard. For example, one man lays
   before another with whom he is talking, the proposition, "What I am,
   you are not." The other assents, for the proposition is in part true,
   the one man being cunning and the other simple. Then the first speaker
   adds: "I am a man;" and when the other has given his assent to this
   also, the first draws his conclusion: "Then you are not a man." Now at
   this sort of ensnaring arguments, Scripture, as I judge, expresses
   detestation in that place where it is said, "There is one that showeth
   wisdom in words, and is hated;" although, indeed, a style of speech
   which is not intended to entrap, but only aims at verbal ornamentation
   more than is consistent with seriousness of purpose, is also called
   sophistical.

   49. There are also valid processes of reasoning which lead to false
   conclusions, by following out to its logical consequences the error of
   the man with whom one is arguing; and these conclusions are sometimes
   drawn by a good and learned man, with the object of making the person
   from whose error these consequences result, feel ashamed of them, and
   of thus leading him to give up his error, when he finds that if he
   wishes to retain his old opinion, he must of necessity also hold other
   opinions which he condemns. For example, the apostle did not draw true
   conclusions when he said, "Then is Christ not risen," and again, "Then
   is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain;" and further on
   drew other inferences which are all utterly false; for Christ has
   risen, the preaching of those who declared this fact was not in vain,
   nor was their faith in vain who had believed it. But all these false
   inferences followed legitimately from the opinion of those who said
   that there is no resurrection of the dead. These inferences, then,
   being repudiated as false, it follows that since they would be true if
   the dead rise not, there will be a resurrection of the dead. As, then,
   valid conclusions may be drawn not only from true but from false
   propositions, the laws of valid reasoning may easily be learnt in the
   schools, outside the pale of the Church. But the truth of propositions
   must be inquired into in the sacred books of the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 32

   50. And yet the validity of logical sequences is not a thing devised by
   men, but is observed and noted by them that they may be able to learn
   and teach it; for it exists eternally in the reason of things, and has
   its origin with God. For as the man who narrates the order of events
   does not himself create that order; and as he who describes the
   situations of places, or the natures of animals, or roots, or minerals,
   does not describe arrangements of man; and as he who points out the
   stars and their movements does not point out anything that he himself
   or any other man has ordained;--in the same way, he who says, "When the
   consequent is false, the antecedent must also be false," says what is
   most true; but he does not himself make it so, he only points out that
   it is so. And it is upon this rule that the reasoning I have quoted
   from the Apostle Paul proceeds. For the antecedent is, "There is no
   resurrection of the dead," the position taken up by those whose error
   the apostle wished to overthrow. Next, from this antecedent, the
   assertion, viz., that there is no resurrection of the dead, the
   necessary consequence is, "Then Christ is not risen." But this
   consequence is false, for Christ has risen; therefore the antecedent is
   also false. But the antecedent is, that there is no resurrection of the
   dead. We conclude, therefore, that there is a resurrection of the dead.
   Now all this is briefly expressed thus: If there is no resurrection of
   the dead, then is Christ not risen; but Christ is risen, therefore
   there is a resurrection of the dead. This rule, then, that when the
   consequent is removed, the antecedent must also be removed, is not made
   by man, but only pointed out by him. And this rule has reference to the
   validity of the reasoning, not to the truth of the statements.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 33

   51. In this passage, however, where the argument is about the
   resurrection, both the law of the inference is valid, and the
   conclusion arrived at is true. But in the case of false conclusions,
   too, there is a validity of inference in some such way as the
   following. Let us suppose some man to have admitted: If a snail is an
   animal, it has a voice. This being admitted, then, when it has been
   proved that the snail has no voice, it follows (since when the
   consequent is proved false, the antecedent is also false) that the
   snail is not an animal. Now this conclusion is false, but it is a true
   and valid inference from the false admission. Thus, the truth of a
   statement stands on its own merits; the validity of an inference
   depends on the statement or the admission of the man with whom one is
   arguing. And thus, as I said above, a false inference may be drawn by a
   valid process of reasoning, in order that he whose error we wish to
   correct may be sorry that he has admitted the antecedent, when he sees
   that its logical consequences are utterly untenable. And hence it is
   easy to understand that as the inferences may be valid where the
   opinions are false, so the inferences may be unsound where the opinions
   are true. For example, suppose that a man propounds the statement, "If
   this man is just, he is good," and we admit its truth. Then he adds,
   "But he is not just;" and when we admit this too, he draws the
   conclusion, "Therefore he is not good." Now although every one of these
   statements may be true, still the principle of the inference is
   unsound. For it is not true that, as when the consequent is proved
   false the antecedent is also false, so when the antecedent is proved
   false the consequent is false. For the statement is true, "If he is an
   orator, he is a man." But if we add, "He is not an orator," the
   consequence does not follow, "He is not a man."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 34

   52. Therefore it is one thing to know the laws of inference, and
   another to know the truth of opinions. In the former case we learn what
   is consequent, what is inconsequent, and what is incompatible. An
   example of a consequent is, "If he is an orator, he is a man;" of an
   inconsequent, "If he is a man, he is an orator;" of an incompatible,
   "If he is a man, he is a quadruped." In these instances we judge of the
   connection. In regard to the truth of opinions, however, we must
   consider propositions as they stand by themselves, and not in their
   connection with one another; but when propositions that we are not sure
   about are joined by a valid inference to propositions that are true and
   certain, they themselves, too, necessarily become certain. Now some,
   when they have ascertained the validity of the inference, plume
   themselves as if this involved also the truth of the propositions.
   Many, again, who hold the true opinions have an unfounded contempt for
   themselves, because they are ignorant of the laws of inference; whereas
   the man who knows that there is a resurrection of the dead is assuredly
   better than the man who only knows that it follows that if there is no
   resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 35

   53. Again, the science of definition, of division, and of partition,
   although it is frequently applied to falsities, is not itself false,
   nor framed by man's device, but is evolved from the reason of things.
   For although poets have applied it to their fictions, and false
   philosophers, or even heretics--that is, false Christians--to their
   erroneous doctrines, that is no reason why it should be false, for
   example, that neither in definition, nor in division, nor in partition,
   is anything to be included that does not pertain to the matter in hand,
   nor anything to be omitted that does. This is true, even though the
   things to be defined or divided are not true. For even falsehood itself
   is defined when we say that falsehood is the declaration of a state of
   things which is not as we declare it to be; and this definition is
   true, although falsehood itself cannot be true. We can also divide it,
   saying that there are two kinds of falsehood, one in regard to things
   that cannot be true at all, the other in regard to things that are not,
   though it is possible they might be, true. For example, the man who
   says that seven and three are eleven, says what cannot be true under
   any circumstances; but he who says that it rained on the kalends of
   January, although perhaps the fact is not so, says what possibly might
   have been. The definition and division, therefore, of what is false may
   be perfectly true, although what is false cannot, of course, itself be
   true.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 36

   54. There are also certain rules for a more copious kind of argument,
   which is called eloquence, and these rules are not the less true that
   they can be used for persuading men of what is false; but as they can
   be used to enforce the truth as well, it is not the faculty itself that
   is to be blamed, but the perversity of those who put it to a bad use.
   Nor is it owing to an arrangement among men that the expression of
   affection conciliates the hearer, or that a narrative, when it is short
   and clear, is effective, and that variety arrests men's attention
   without wearying them. And it is the same with other directions of the
   same kind, which, whether the cause in which they are used be true or
   false, are themselves true just in so far as they are effective in
   producing knowledge or belief, or in moving men's minds to desire and
   aversion. And men rather found out that these things are so, than
   arranged that they should be so.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 37

   55. This art, however, when it is learnt, is not to be used so much for
   ascertaining the meaning as for setting forth the meaning when it is
   ascertained. But the art previously spoken of, which deals with
   inferences, and definitions, and divisions, is of the greatest
   assistance in the discovery of the meaning, provided only that men do
   not fall into the error of supposing that when they have learnt these
   things they have learnt the true secret of a happy life. Still, it
   sometimes happens that men find less difficulty in attaining the object
   for the sake of which these sciences are learnt, than in going through
   the very intricate and thorny discipline of such rules. It is just as
   if a man wishing to give rules for walking should warn you not to lift
   the hinder foot before you set down the front one, and then should
   describe minutely the way you ought to move the hinges of the joints
   and knees. For what he says is true, and one cannot walk in any other
   way; but men find it easier to walk by executing these movements than
   to attend to them while they are going through them, or to understand
   when they are told about them. Those, on the other hand, who cannot
   walk, care still less about such directions, as they cannot prove them
   by making trial of them. And in the same way a clever man often sees
   that an inference is unsound more quickly than he apprehends the rules
   for it. A dull man, on the other hand, does not see the unsoundness,
   but much less does he grasp the rules. And in regard to all these laws,
   we derive more pleasure from them as exhibitions of truth, than
   assistance in arguing or forming opinions, except perhaps that they put
   the intellect in better training. We must take care, however, that they
   do not at the same time make it more inclined to mischief or
   vanity,--that is to say, that they do not give those who have learnt
   them an inclination to lead people astray by plausible speech and
   catching questions, or make them think that they have attained some
   great thing that gives them an advantage over the good and innocent.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 38

   56. Coming now to the science of number, it is clear to the dullest
   apprehension that this was not created by man, but was discovered by
   investigation. For, though Virgil could at his own pleasure make the
   first syllable of Italia long, while the ancients pronounced it short,
   it is not in any man's power to determine at his pleasure that three
   times three are not nine, or do not make a square, or are not the
   triple of three, nor one and a half times the number six, or that it is
   not true that they are not the double of any number because odd numbers
   have no half. Whether, then, numbers are considered in themselves, or
   as applied to the laws of figures, or of sounds, or of other motions,
   they have fixed laws which were not made by man, but which the
   acuteness of ingenious men brought to light.

   57. The man, however, who puts so high a value on these things as to be
   inclined to boast himself one of the learned, and who does not rather
   inquire after the source from which those things which he perceives to
   be true derive their truth, and from which those others which he
   perceives to be unchangeable also derive their truth and
   unchangeableness, and who, mounting up from bodily appearances to the
   mind of man, and finding that it too is changeable (for it is sometimes
   instructed, at other times uninstructed), although it holds a middle
   place between the unchangeable truth above it and the changeable things
   beneath it, does not strive to make all things redound to the praise
   and love of the one God from whom he knows that all things have their
   being;-- the man, I say, who acts in this way may seem to be learned,
   but wise he cannot in any sense be deemed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 39

   58. Accordingly, I think that it is well to warn studious and able
   young men, who fear God and are seeking for happiness of life, not to
   venture heedlessly upon the pursuit of the branches of learning that
   are in vogue beyond the pale of the Church of Christ, as if these could
   secure for them the happiness they seek; but soberly and carefully to
   discriminate among them. And if they find any of those which have been
   instituted by men varying by reason of the varying pleasure of their
   founders, and unknown by reason of erroneous conjectures, especially if
   they involve entering into fellowship with devils by means of leagues
   and covenants about signs, let these he utterly rejected and held in
   detestation. Let the young men also withdraw their attention from such
   institutions of men as are unnecessary and luxurious. But for the sake
   of the necessities of this life we must not neglect the arrangements of
   men that enable us to carry on intercourse with those around us. I
   think, however, there is nothing useful in the other branches of
   learning that are found among the heathen, except information about
   objects, either past or present, that relate to the bodily senses, in
   which are included also the experiments and conclusions of the useful
   mechanical arts, except also the sciences of reasoning and of number.
   And in regard to all these we must hold by the maxim, "Not too much of
   anything;" especially in the case of those which, pertaining as they do
   to the senses, are subject to the relations of space and time.

   59. What, then, some men have done in regard to all words and names
   found in Scripture, in the Hebrew, and Syrian, and Egyptian, and other
   tongues, taking up and interpreting separately such as were left in
   Scripture without interpretation; and what Eusebius has done in regard
   to the history of the past with a view to the questions arising in
   Scripture that require a knowledge of history for their
   solution;--what, I say, these men have done in regard to matters of
   this kind, making it unnecessary for the Christian to spend his
   strength on many subjects for the sake of a few items of knowledge, the
   same, I think, might be done in regard to other matters, if any
   competent man were willing in a spirit of benevolence to undertake the
   labour for the advantage of his brethren. In this way he might arrange
   in their several classes, and give an account of the unknown places,
   and animals, and plants, and trees, and stones, and metals, and other
   species of things that are mentioned in Scripture, taking up these
   only, and committing his account to writing. This might also be done in
   relation to numbers, so that the theory of those numbers, and those
   only, which are mentioned in Holy Scripture, might be explained and
   written down. And it may happen that some or all of these things have
   been done already (as I have found that many things I had no notion of
   have been worked out and committed to writing by good and learned
   Christians), but are either lost amid the crowds of the careless, or
   are kept out of sight by the envious. And I am not sure whether the
   same thing can be done in regard to the theory of reasoning; but it
   seems to me it cannot, because this runs like a system of nerves
   through the whole structure of Scripture, and on that account is of
   more service to the reader in disentangling and explaining ambiguous
   passages, of which I shall speak hereafter, than in ascertaining the
   meaning of unknown signs, the topic I am now discussing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 40

   60. Moreover, if those who are called philosophers, and especially the
   Platonists, have said aught that is true and in harmony with our faith,
   we are not only not to shrink from it, but to claim it for our own use
   from those who have unlawful possession of it. For, as the Egyptians
   had not only the idols and heavy burdens which the people of Israel
   hated and fled from, but also vessels and ornaments of gold and silver,
   and garments, which the same people when going out of Egypt
   appropriated to themselves, designing them for a better use, not doing
   this on their own authority, but by the command of God, the Egyptians
   themselves, in their ignorance, providing them with things which they
   themselves, were not making a good use of; in the same way all branches
   of heathen learning have not only false and superstitious fancies and
   heavy burdens of unnecessary toil, which every one of us, when going
   out under the leadership of Christ from the fellowship of the heathen,
   ought to abhor and avoid; but they contain also liberal instruction
   which is better adapted to the use of the truth, and some most
   excellent precepts of morality; and some truths in regard even to the
   worship of the One God are found among them. Now these are, so to
   speak, their gold and silver, which they did not create themselves, but
   dug out of the mines of God's providence which are everywhere scattered
   abroad, and are perversely and unlawfully prostituting to the worship
   of devils. These, therefore, the Christian, when he separates himself
   in spirit from the miserable fellowship of these men, ought to take
   away from them, and to devote to their proper use in preaching the
   gospel. Their garments, also,--that is, human institutions such as are
   adapted to that intercourse with men which is indispensable in this
   life,--we must take and turn to a Christian use.

   61. And what else have many good and faithful men among our brethren
   done? Do we not see with what a quantity of gold and silver and
   garments Cyprian, that most persuasive teacher and most blessed martyr,
   was loaded when he came out of Egypt? How much Lactantius brought with
   him? And Victorious, and Optatus, and Hilary, not to speak of living
   men! How much Greeks out of number have borrowed! And prior to all
   these, that most faithful servant of God, Moses, had done the same
   thing; for of him it is written that he was learned in all the wisdom
   of the Egyptians. And to none of all these would heathen superstition
   (especially in those times when, kicking against the yoke of Christ, it
   was persecuting the Christians) have ever furnished branches of
   knowledge it held useful, if it had suspected they were about to turn
   them to the use of worshipping the One God, and thereby overturning the
   vain worship of idols. But they gave their gold and their silver and
   their garments to the people of God as they were going out of Egypt,
   not knowing how the things they gave would be turned to the service of
   Christ. For what was done at the time of the exodus was no doubt a type
   prefiguring what happens now. And this I say without prejudice to any
   other interpretation that may be as good, or better.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 41

   62. But when the student of the Holy Scriptures, prepared in the way I
   have indicated, shall enter upon his investigations, let him constantly
   meditate upon that saying of the apostle's, "Knowledge puffeth up, but
   charity edifieth." For so he will feel that, whatever may be the riches
   he brings with him out of Egypt, yet unless he has kept the Passover,
   he cannot be safe. Now Christ is our Passover sacrificed for us, and
   there is nothing the sacrifice of Christ more clearly teaches us than
   the call which He himself addresses to those whom He sees toiling in
   Egypt under Pharaoh: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
   laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of
   me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
   souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light." To whom is it
   light but to the meek and lowly in heart, whom knowledge does not puff
   up, but charity edifieth? Let them remember, then, that those who
   celebrated the Passover at that time in type and shadow, when they were
   ordered to mark their door-posts with the blood of the lamb, used
   hyssop to mark them with. Now this is a meek and lowly herb, and yet
   nothing is stronger and more penetrating than its roots; that being
   rooted and grounded in love, we may be able to comprehend with all
   saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,--that
   is, to comprehend the cross of our Lord, the breadth of which is
   indicated by the transverse wood on which the hands are stretched, its
   length by the part from the ground up to the crossbar on which the
   whole body from the head downwards is fixed, its height by the part
   from the crossbar to the top on which the head lies, and its depth by
   the part which is hidden, being fixed in the earth. And by this sign of
   the cross all Christian action is symbolized, viz., to do good works in
   Christ, to cling with constancy to Him, to hope for heaven, and not to
   desecrate the sacraments. And purified by this Christian action, we
   shall be able to know even "the love of Christ which passeth
   knowledge," who is equal to the Father, by whom all things, were made,
   "that we may be filled with all the fullness of God." There is besides
   in hyssop a purgative virtue, that the breast may not be swollen with
   that knowledge which puffeth up, nor boast vainly of the riches brought
   out from Egypt. "Purge me with hyssop," the psalmist says, "and I shall
   be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy
   and gladness." Then he immediately adds, to show that it is purifying
   from pride that is indicated by hyssop, "that the bones which Thou hast
   broken may rejoice."

  Chapter 42

   63. But just as poor as the store of gold and silver and garments which
   the people of Israel brought with them out of Egypt was in comparison
   with the riches which they afterwards attained at Jerusalem, and which
   reached their height in the reign of King Solomon, so poor is all the
   useful knowledge which is gathered from the books of the heathen when
   compared with the knowledge of Holy Scripture. For whatever man may
   have learnt from other sources, if it is hurtful, it is there
   condemned; if it is useful, it is therein contained. And while every
   man may find there all that he has learnt of useful elsewhere, he will
   find there in much greater abundance things that are to be found
   nowhere else, but can be learnt only in the wonderful sublimity and
   wonderful simplicity of the Scriptures.

   When, then, the reader is possessed of the instruction here pointed
   out, so that unknown signs have ceased to be a hindrance to him; when
   he is meek and lowly of heart, subject to the easy yoke of Christ, and
   loaded with His light burden, rooted and grounded and built up in
   faith, so that knowledge cannot puff him up, let him then approach the
   consideration and discussion of ambiguous signs in Scripture. And about
   these I shall now, in a third book, endeavour to say what the Lord
   shall be pleased to vouchsafe.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   The author, having discussed in the preceding book the method of
   dealing with unknown signs, goes on in this third book to treat of
   ambiguous signs. Such signs may be either direct or figurative. In the
   case of direct signs ambiguity may arise from the punctuation, the
   pronunciation, or the doubtful signification of the words, and is to be
   resolved by attention to the context, a comparison of translations, or
   a reference to the original tongue. In the case of figurative signs we
   need to guard against two mistakes:--1. the interpreting literal
   expressions figuratively; 2. the interpreting figurative expressions
   literally. The author lays down rules by which we may decide whether an
   expression is literal or figurative; the general rule being, that
   whatever can be shown to be in its literal sense inconsistent either
   with purity of life or correctness of doctrine must be taken
   figuratively. He then goes on to lay down rules for the interpretation
   of expressions which have been proved to be figurative; the general
   principle being, that no interpretation can be true which does not
   promote the love of God and the love of man. The author then proceeds
   to expound and illustrate the seven rules of Tichonius the Donatist,
   which he commends to the attention of the student of Holy Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   1. The man who fears God seeks diligently in Holy Scripture for a
   knowledge of His will. And when he has become meek through piety, so as
   to have no love of strife; when furnished also with a knowledge of
   languages, so as not to be stopped by unknown words and forms of
   speech, and with the knowledge of certain necessary objects, so as not
   to be ignorant of the force and nature of those which are used
   figuratively; and assisted, besides, by accuracy in the texts, which
   has been secured by skill and care in the matter of correction;--when
   thus prepared, let him proceed to the examination and solution of the
   ambiguities of Scripture. And that he may not be led astray by
   ambiguous signs, I so far as I can give him instruction (it may happen
   however, that either from the greatness of his intellect, or the
   greater clearness of the light he enjoys, he shall laugh at the methods
   I am going to point out as childish),--but yet, as I was going to say,
   so far as I can give instruction, let him who is in such a state of
   mind that he can be instructed by me know, that the ambiguity of
   Scripture lies either in proper words or in metaphorical, classes which
   I have already described in the second book.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   2. But when proper words make Scripture ambiguous, we must see in the
   first place that there is nothing wrong in our punctuation or
   pronunciation. Accordingly, if, when attention is given to the passage,
   it shall appear to be uncertain in what way it ought to be punctuated
   or pronounced, let the reader consult the rule of faith which he has
   gathered from the plainer passages of Scripture, and from the authority
   of the Church, and of which I treated at sufficient length when I was
   speaking in the first book about things. But if both readings, or all
   of them (if there are more than two), give a meaning in harmony with
   the faith, it remains to consult the context, both what goes before and
   what comes after, to see which interpretation, out of many that offer
   themselves, it pronounces for and permits to be dovetailed into itself.

   3. Now look at some examples. The heretical pointing, "In principio
   erat verbum, et verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat" (In the beginning
   was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was), so as to make
   the next sentence run, "Verbum hoc erat in principio apud Deum" (This
   word was in the beginning with God), arises out of unwillingness to
   confess that the Word was God. But this must be rejected by the rule of
   faith, which, in reference to the equality of the Trinity, directs us
   to say: "et Deus erat verbum" (and the Word was God); and then to add:
   "hoc erat in principio apud Deum" (the same was in the beginning with
   God).

   4. But the following ambiguity of punctuation does not go against the
   faith in either way you take it, and therefore must be decided from the
   context. It is where the apostle says: "

   What I shall choose I wot not: for I am in a strait betwixt two, having
   a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better:
   nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you." Now it is
   uncertain whether we should read, "ex duobus concupiscentiam habens"
   [having a desire for two things], or "compellor autem ex duobus" [I am
   in a strait betwixt two]; and so to add: "concupiscentiam habens
   dissolvi, et esse cum Christo" [having a desire to depart, and to be
   with Christ]. But since there follows "multo enim magis optimum" [for
   it is far better], it is evident that he says he has a desire for that
   which is better; so that, while he is in a strait betwixt two, yet he
   has a desire for one and sees a necessity for the other; a desire,
   viz., to be with Christ, and a necessity to remain in the flesh. Now
   this ambiguity is resolved by one word that follows, which is
   translated denim [for]; and the translators who have omitted this
   particle have preferred the interpretation which makes the apostle seem
   not only in a strait betwixt two, but also to have a desire for two. We
   must therefore punctuate the sentence thus: "et quid eligam ignoro:
   compellor autem ex duobus" [what I shall choose I wot not: for I am in
   a strait betwixt two]; and after this point follows: "concupiscentiam
   habens dissolvi, et esse cum Christo" [having a desire to depart, and
   to be with Christ]. And, as if he were asked why he has a desire for
   this in preference to the other, he adds: "multo enim magis optimum"
   [for it is far better]. Why, then, is he in a strait betwixt the two?
   Because there is a need for his remaining, which he adds in these
   terms: "manere in carne necessarium propter vos" [nevertheless to abide
   in the flesh is more needful for you].

   5. Where, however, the ambiguity cannot be cleared up, either by the
   rule of faith or by the context, there is nothing to hinder us to point
   the sentence according to any method we choose of those that suggest
   themselves. As is the case in that passage to the Corinthians: "

   Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God. Receive us; we have wronged no man." It is
   doubtful whether we should read, mundemus nos ab omni coinquinatione
   carnis et spiritus" [let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
   the flesh and spirit], in accordance with the passage, "that she may be
   holy both in body and in spirit," or, "mundemus nos ab omni
   coinquintione carnis" [let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
   the flesh], so as to make the next sentence, "et spiritus perficientes
   sanctificationem in timore Dei capite nos" [and perfecting holiness of
   spirit in the fear of God, receive us]. Such ambiguities of
   punctuation, therefore, are left to the reader's discretion.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   6. And all the directions that I have given about ambiguous
   punctuations are to be observed likewise in the case of doubtful
   pronunciations. For these too, unless the fault lies in the
   carelessness of the reader, are corrected either by the rule of faith,
   or by a reference to the preceding or succeeding context; or if neither
   of these methods is applied with success, they will remain doubtful,
   but so that the reader will not be in fault in whatever way he may
   pronounce them. For example, if our faith that God will not bring any
   charges against His elect, and that Christ will not condemn His elect,
   did not stand in the way, this passage, "Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect?" might be pronounced in such a way as to make
   what follows an answer to this question, "God who justifieth," and to
   make a second question, "Who is he that condemneth?" with the answer,
   "Christ Jesus who died." But as it would be the height of madness to
   believe this, the passage will be pronounced in such a way as to make
   the first part a question of inquiry, and the second a rhetorical
   interrogative. Now the ancients said that the difference between an
   inquiry and an interrogative was this, that an inquiry admits of many
   answers, but to an interrogative the answer must be either "No" or
   "Yes." The passage will be pronounced, then, in such a way that after
   the inquiry, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?"
   what follows will be put as an interrogative: "Shall God who
   justifieth?" the answer "No" being understood. And in the same way we
   shall have the inquiry, "Who is he that condemneth?" and the answer
   here again in the form of an interrogative, "Is it Christ who died?
   yea, rather, who is risen again? who is even at the right hand of God?
   who also maketh intercession for us?" the answer "No" being understood
   to every one of these questions. On the other hand, in that passage
   where the apostle says, "What shall we say then? That the Gentiles
   which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness;"
   unless after the inquiry, "What shall we say then?" what follows were
   given as the answer to this question: "That the Gentiles, which
   followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness;" it
   would not be in harmony with the succeeding context. But with whatever
   tone of voice one may choose to pronounce that saying of Nathanael's, "

   Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"--whether with that of a man
   who gives an affirmative answer, so that "out of Nazareth" is the only
   part that belongs to the interrogation, or with that of a man who asks
   the whole question with doubt and hesitation,--I do not see how a
   difference can be made. But neither sense is opposed to faith.

   7. There is, again, an ambiguity arising out of the doubtful sound of
   syllables; and this of course has relation to pronunciation. For
   example, in the passage, "My bone [os meum] was not hid from Thee,
   which Thou didst make in secret," it is not clear to the reader whether
   he should take the word "os" as short or long. If he make it short, it
   is the singular of ossa [bones]; if he make it long, it is the singular
   of ora [mouths]. Now difficulties such as this are cleared up by
   looking into the original tongue, for in the Greek we find not "stome"
   [mouth], but "osteon" [bone]. And for this reason the vulgar idiom is
   frequently more useful in conveying the sense than the pure speech of
   the educated. For I would rather have the barbarism, "non est
   absconditum a te ossum meum", than have the passage in better Latin but
   the sense less clear. But sometimes when the sound of a syllable is
   doubtful, it is decided by a word near it belonging to the same
   sentence. As, for example, that saying of the apostle, "Of the which I
   tell you before [praedico], as I have also told you in time past
   [praedixi], that

   they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Now if
   he had only said, "Of the which I tell you before [quae praedico
   vobis]", and had not added, "as I have also told you in time past
   [sicut praedixi]," we could not know without going back to the original
   whether in the word praedico the middle syllable should be pronounced
   long or short. But as it is, it is clear that it should be pronounced
   long; for he does not say, sicut praedicavi, but sicut praedixi.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   8. And not only these, but also those ambiguities that do not relate
   either to punctuation or pronunciation, are to be examined in the same
   way. For example, that one in the Epistle to the Thessalonians:
   "Propterea consolati sumus fratres in vobis". Now it is doubtful
   whether "fratres" [brethren] is in the vocative or accusative case, and
   it is not contrary to faith to take it either way. But in the Greek
   language the two cases are not the same in form; and accordingly, when
   we look into the original, the case is shown to be vocative. Now if the
   translator had chosen to say, "propterea consolationem habuimus fratres
   in vobis", he would have followed the words less literally, but there
   would have been less doubt about the meaning; or, indeed, if he had
   added "nostri", hardly any one would have doubted that the vocative
   case was meant when he heard "propterea consolationem habuimus fratres
   in vobis", But this is a rather dangerous liberty to take. It has been
   taken, however in that passage to the Corinthians, where the apostle
   says, "I protest by your rejoicing [per vestram gloriam] which I have
   in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily." For one translator has it, "per
   vestram" juro "gloriam", the form of adjuration appearing in the Greek
   without any ambiguity. It is therefore very rare and very difficult to
   find any ambiguity in the case of proper words, as far at least as Holy
   Scripture is concerned, which neither the context, showing the design
   of the writer, nor a comparison of translations, nor a reference to the
   original tongue, will suffice to explain.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   9. But the ambiguities of metaphorical words, about which I am next to
   speak, demand no ordinary care and diligence. In the first place, we
   must beware of taking a figurative expression literally. For the saying
   of the apostle applies in this case too: "The letter killeth, but the
   spirit giveth life." For when what is said figuratively is taken as if
   it were said literally, it is understood in a carnal manner. And
   nothing is more fittingly called the death of the soul than when that
   in it which raises it above the brutes, the intelligence namely, is put
   in subjection to the flesh by a blind adherence to the letter. For he
   who follows the letter takes figurative words as if they were proper,
   and does not carry out what is indicated by a proper word into its
   secondary signification; but, if he hears of the Sabbath, for example,
   thinks of nothing but the one day out of seven which recurs in constant
   succession; and when he hears of a sacrifice, does not carry his
   thoughts beyond the customary offerings of victims from the flock, and
   of the fruits of the earth. Now it is surely a miserable slavery of the
   soul to take signs for things, and to be unable to lift the eye of the
   mind above what is corporeal and created, that it may drink in eternal
   light.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   10. This bondage, however, in the case of the Jewish people, differed
   widely from what it was in the case of the other nations; because,
   though the former were in bondage to temporal things, it was in such a
   way that in all these the One God was put before their minds. And
   although they paid attention to the signs of spiritual realities in
   place of the realities themselves, not knowing to what the signs
   referred, still they had this conviction rooted in their minds, that in
   subjecting themselves to such a bondage they were doing the pleasure of
   the one invisible God of all. And the apostle describes this bondage as
   being like to that of boys under the guidance of a schoolmaster. And
   those who clung obstinately to such signs could not endure our Lord's
   neglect of them when the time for their revelation had come. And hence
   their leaders brought it as a charge against Him that He healed on the
   Sabbath, and the people, clinging to these signs as it they were
   realities, could not believe that one who refused to observe them in
   the way the Jews did was God, or came from God. But those who did
   believe, from among whom the first Church at Jerusalem was formed,
   showed clearly how great an advantage it had been to be so guided by
   the schoolmaster that signs, which had been for a season imposed on the
   obedient, fixed the thoughts of those who observed them on the worship
   of the One God who made heaven and earth. These men, because they had
   been very near to spiritual things (for even in the temporal and carnal
   offerings and types, though they did not clearly apprehend their
   spiritual meaning, they had learnt to adore the One Eternal God,) were
   filled with such a measure of the Holy Spirit that they sold all their
   goods, and laid their price at the apostles' feet to be distributed
   among the needy, and consecrated themselves wholly to God as a new
   temple, of which the old temple they were serving was but the earthly
   type.

   11. Now it is not recorded that any of the Gentile churches did this,
   because men who had for their gods idols made with hands had not been
   so near to spiritual things.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   And if ever any of them endeavoured to make it out that their idols
   were only signs, yet still they used them in reference to the worship
   and adoration of the creature. What difference does it make to me, for
   instance, that the image of Neptune is not itself to be considered a
   god, but only as representing the wide ocean, and all the other waters
   besides that spring out of fountains? As it is described by a poet of
   theirs, who says, if I recollect aright, "Thou, Father Neptune, whose
   hoary temples are wreathed with the resounding sea, whose beard is the
   mighty ocean flowing forth unceasingly, and whose hair is the winding
   rivers." This husk shakes its rattling stones within a sweet covering,
   and yet it is not food for men, but for swine. He who knows the gospel
   knows what I mean. What profit is it to me, then, that the image of
   Neptune is used with a reference to this explanation of it, unless
   indeed the result be that I worship neither? For any statue you like to
   take is as much god to me as the wide ocean. I grant, however, that
   they who make gods of the works of man have sunk lower than they who
   make gods of the works of God. But the command is that we should love
   and serve the One God, who is the Maker of all those things, the images
   of which are worshipped by the heathen either as gods, or as signs and
   representations of gods. If, then, to take a sign which has been
   established for a useful end instead of the thing itself which it was
   designed to signify, is bondage to the flesh, how much more so is it to
   take signs intended to represent useless things for the things
   themselves! For even if you go back to the very things signified by
   such signs, and engage your mind in the worship of these, you will not
   be anything the more free from the burden and the livery of bondage to
   the flesh.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   12. Accordingly the liberty that comes by Christ took those whom it
   found under bondage to useful signs, and who were (so to speak) near to
   it, and, interpreting the signs to which they were in bondage, set them
   free by raising them to the realities of which these were signs. And
   out of such were formed the churches of the saints of Israel. Those, on
   the other hand, whom it found in bondage to useless signs, it not only
   freed from their slavery to such signs, but brought to nothing and
   cleared out of the way all these signs themselves, so that the gentiles
   were turned from the corruption of a multitude of false gods, which
   Scripture frequently and justly speaks of as fornication, to the
   worship of the One God: not that they might now fall into bondage to
   signs of a useful kind, but rather that they might exercise their minds
   in the spiritual understanding of such.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   13. Now he is in bondage to a sign who uses, or pays homage to, any
   significant object without knowing what it signifies: he, on the other
   hand, who either uses or honours a useful sign divinely appointed,
   whose force and significance he understands, does not honour the sign
   which is seen and temporal, but that to which all such signs refer. Now
   such a man is spiritual and free even at the time of his bondage, when
   it is not yet expedient to reveal to carnal minds those signs by
   subjection to which their carnality is to be overcome. To this class of
   spiritual persons belonged the patriarchs and the prophets, and all
   those among the people of Israel through whose instrumentality the Holy
   Spirit ministered unto us the aids and consolations of the Scriptures.
   But at the present time, after that the proof of our liberty has shone
   forth so clearly in the resurrection of our Lord, we are not oppressed
   with the heavy burden of attending even to those signs which we now
   understand, but our Lord Himself, and apostolic practice, have handed
   down to us a few rites in place of many, and these at once very easy to
   perform, most majestic in their significance, and most sacred in the
   observance; such, for example, as the Sacrament of baptism, and the
   celebration of the body and blood of the Lord. And as soon as any one
   looks upon these observances he knows to what they refer, and so
   reveres them not in carnal bondage, but in spiritual freedom. Now, as
   to follow the letter, and to take signs for the things that are
   signified by them, is a mark of weakness and bondage; so to interpret
   signs wrongly is the result of being misled by error. He, however, who
   does not understand what a sign signifies, but yet knows that it is a
   sign, is not in bondage. And it is better even to be in bondage to
   unknown but useful signs than, by interpreting them wrongly, to draw
   the neck from under the yoke of bondage only to insert it in the coils
   of error.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   14. But in addition to the foregoing rule, which guards us against
   taking a metaphorical form of speech as if it were literal, we must
   also pay heed to that which tells us not to take a literal form of
   speech as if it were figurative. In the first place, then, we must show
   the way to find out whether a phrase is literal or figurative. And the
   way is certainly as follows: Whatever there is in the word of God that
   cannot, when taken literally, be referred either to purity of life or
   soundness of doctrine, you may set down as figurative. Purity of life
   has reference to the love of God and one's neighbour; soundness of
   doctrine to the knowledge of God and one's neighbour. Every man,
   moreover, has hope in his own conscience, so far as he perceives that
   he has attained to the love and knowledge of God and his neighbour. Now
   all these matters have been spoken of in the first book.

   15. But as men are prone to estimate sins, not by reference to their
   inherent sinfulness, but rather by reference to their own customs, it
   frequently happens that a man will think nothing blameable except what
   the men of his own country and time are accustomed to condemn, and
   nothing worthy of praise or approval except what is sanctioned by the
   custom of his companions; and thus it comes to pass, that if Scripture
   either enjoins what is opposed to the customs of the hearers, or
   condemns what is not so opposed, and if at the same time the authority
   of the word has a hold upon their minds, they think that the expression
   is figurative. Now Scripture enjoins nothing except charity, and
   condemns nothing except lust, and in that way fashions the lives of
   men. In the same way, if an erroneous opinion has taken possession of
   the mind, men think that whatever Scripture asserts contrary to this
   must be figurative. Now Scripture asserts nothing but the catholic
   faith, in regard to things past, future, and present. It is a narrative
   of the past, a prophecy of the future, and a description of the
   present. But all these tend to nourish and strengthen charity, and to
   overcome and root out lust.

   16. I mean by charity that affection of the mind which aims at the
   enjoyment of God for His own sake, and the enjoyment of ones self and
   one's neighbour in subordination to God; by lust I mean that affection
   of the mind which aims at enjoying one's self and one's neighbour, and
   other corporeal things, without reference to God. Again, what lust,
   when unsubdued, does towards corrupting one's own soul and body, is
   called vice; but what it does to injure another is called crime. And
   these are the two classes into which all sins may be divided. But the
   vices come first; for when these have exhausted the soul, and reduced
   it to a kind of poverty, it easily slides into crimes, in order to
   remove hindrances to, or to find assistance in, its vices. In the same
   way, what charity does with a view to one's own advantage is prudence;
   but what it does with a view to a neighbor's advantage is called
   benevolence. And here prudence comes first; because no one can confer
   an advantage on another which he does not himself possess. Now in
   proportion as the dominion of lust is pulled down, in the same
   proportion is that of charity built up.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   17. Every severity, therefore, and apparent cruelty, either in word or
   deed, that is ascribed in Holy Scripture to God or His saints, avails
   to the pulling down of the dominion of lust. And if its meaning be
   clear, we are not to give it some secondary reference, as if it were
   spoken figuratively. Take, for example, that saying of the apostle:
   "But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasures up unto
   thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
   judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds:
   to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and
   honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are
   contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
   indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
   that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile." But this is
   addressed to those who, being unwilling to subdue their lust, are
   themselves involved in the destruction of their lust. When, however,
   the dominion of lust is overturned in a man over whom it had held sway,
   this plain expression is used: "They that are Christ's have crucified
   the flesh, with the affections and lusts." Only that, even in these
   instances, some words are used figuratively, as for example, "the wrath
   of God" and "crucified." But these are not so numerous, nor placed in
   such a way as to obscure the sense, and make it allegorical or
   enigmatical, which is the kind of expression properly called
   figurative. But in the saying addressed to Jeremiah, "See, I have this
   day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and
   to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down," there is no doubt the
   whole of the language is figurative, and to be referred to the end I
   have spoken of.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   18. Those things, again, whether only sayings or whether actual deeds,
   which appear to the inexperienced to be sinful, and which are ascribed
   to God, or to men whose holiness is put before us as an example, are
   wholly figurative, and the hidden kernel of meaning they contain is to
   be picked out as food for the nourishment of charity. Now, whoever uses
   transitory objects less freely than is the custom of those among whom
   he lives, is either temperate or superstitious; whoever, on the other
   hand, uses them so as to transgress the bounds of the custom of the
   good men about him, either has a further meaning in what he does, or is
   sinful. In all such matters it is not the use of the objects, but the
   lust of the user, that is to blame. Nobody in his sober senses would
   believe, for example, that when our Lord's feet were anointed by the
   woman with precious ointment, it was for the same purpose for which
   luxurious and profligate men are accustomed to have theirs anointed in
   those banquets which we abhor. For the sweet odour means the good
   report which is earned by a life of good works; and the man who wins
   this, while following in the footsteps of Christ, anoints His feet (so
   to speak) with the most precious ointment. And so that which in the
   case of other persons is often a sin, becomes, when ascribed to God or
   a prophet, the sign of some great truth. Keeping company with a harlot,
   for example, is one thing when it is the result of abandoned manners,
   another thing when done in the course of his prophecy by the prophet
   Hosea. Because it is a shamefully wicked thing to strip the body naked
   at a banquet among the drunken and licentious, it does not follow that
   it is a sin to be naked in the baths.

   19. We must, therefore, consider carefully what is suitable to times
   and places and persons, and not rashly charge men with sins. For it is
   possible that a wise man may use the daintiest food without any sin of
   epicurism or gluttony, while a fool will crave for the vilest food with
   a most disgusting eagerness of appetite. And any sane man would prefer
   eating fish after the manner of our Lord, to eating lentils after the
   manner of Esau, or barley after the manner of oxen. For there are
   several beasts that feed on commoner kinds of food, but it does not
   follow that they are more temperate than we are. For in all matters of
   this kind it is not the nature of the things we use, but our reason for
   using them, and our manner of seeking them, that make what we do either
   praiseworthy or blameable.

   20. Now the saints of ancient times were, under the form of an earthly
   kingdom, foreshadowing and foretelling the kingdom of heaven. And on
   account of the necessity for a numerous offspring, the custom of one
   man having several wives was at that time blameless: and for the same
   reason it was not proper for one woman to have several husbands,
   because a woman does not in that way become more fruitful, but, on the
   contrary, it is base harlotry to seek either gain or offspring by
   promiscuous intercourse. In regard to matters of this sort, whatever
   the holy men of those times did without lust, Scripture passes over
   without blame, although they did things which could not be done at the
   present time, except through lust. And everything of this nature that
   is there narrated we are to take not only in its historical and
   literal, but also in its figurative and prophetical sense, and to
   interpret as bearing ultimately upon the end of love towards God or our
   neighbour, or both. For as it was disgraceful among the ancient Romans
   to wear tunics reaching to the heels, and furnished with sleeves, but
   now it is disgraceful for men honorably born not to wear tunics of that
   description: so we must take heed in regard to other things also, that
   lust do not mix with our use of them; for lust not only abuses to
   wicked ends the customs of those among whom we live, but frequently
   also transgressing the bounds of custom, betrays, in a disgraceful
   outbreak, its own hideousness, which was concealed under the cover of
   prevailing fashions.

  Chapter 13

   21. Whatever, then, is in accordance with the habits of those with whom
   we are either compelled by necessity, or undertake as a matter of duty,
   to spend this life, is to be turned by good and great men to some
   prudent or benevolent end, either directly, as is our duty, or
   figuratively, as is allowable to prophets.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   22. But when men unacquainted with other modes of life than their own
   meet with the record of such actions, unless they are restrained by
   authority, they look upon them as sins, and do not consider that their
   own customs either in regard to marriage, or feasts, or dress, or the
   other necessities and adornments of human life, appear sinful to the
   people of other nations and other times. And, distracted by this
   endless variety of customs, some who were half asleep (as I may
   say)--that is, who were neither sunk in the deep sleep of folly, nor
   were able to awake into the light of wisdom--have thought that there
   was no such thing as absolute right, but that every nation took its own
   custom for right; and that, since every nation has a different custom,
   and right must remain unchangeable, it becomes manifest that there is
   no such thing as right at all. Such men did not perceive, to take only
   one example, that the precept, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do
   to you, do ye even so to them," I cannot be altered by any diversity of
   national customs. And this precept, when it is referred to the love of
   God, destroys all vices; when to the love of one's neighbour, puts an
   end to all crimes. For no one is willing to defile his own dwelling; he
   ought not, therefore, to defile the dwelling of God, that is, himself.
   And no one wishes an injury to be done him by another; he himself,
   therefore, ought not to do injury to another.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   23. The tyranny of lust being thus overthrown, charity reigns through
   its supremely just laws of love to God for His own sake, and love to
   one's self and one's neighbour for God's sake. Accordingly, in regard
   to figurative expressions, a rule such as the following will be
   observed, to carefully turn over in our minds and meditate upon what we
   read till an interpretation be found that tends to establish the reign
   of love. Now, if when taken literally it at once gives a meaning of
   this kind, the expression is not to be considered figurative.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   24. If the sentence is one of command, either forbidding a crime or
   vice, or enjoining an act of prudence or benevolence, it is not
   figurative. If, however, it seems to enjoin a crime or vice, or to
   forbid an act of prudence or benevolence, it is figurative. "Except ye
   eat the flesh of the Son of man," says Christ, "and drink His blood, ye
   have no life in you." This seems to enjoin a crime or a vice; it is
   therefore a figure, enjoining that we should have a share in the
   sufferings of our Lord, and that we should retain a sweet and
   profitable memory of the fact that His flesh was wounded and crucified
   for us. Scripture says: "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
   give him drink;" and this is beyond doubt a command to do a kindness.
   But in what follows, "for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on
   his head," one would think a deed of malevolence was enjoined. Do not
   doubt, then, that the expression is figurative; and, while it is
   possible to interpret it in two ways, one pointing to the doing of an
   injury, the other to a display of superiority, let charity on the
   contrary call you back to benevolence, and interpret the coals of fire
   as the burning groans of penitence by which a man's pride is cured who
   bewails that he has been the enemy of one who came to his assistance in
   distress. In the same way, when our Lord says, "He who loveth his life
   shall lose it," we are not to think that He forbids the prudence with
   which it is a man's duty to care for his life, but that He says in a
   figurative sense, "Let him lose his life"--that is, let him destroy and
   lose that perverted and unnatural use which he now makes of his life,
   and through which his desires are fixed on temporal things so that he
   gives no heed to eternal. It is written: "Give to the godly man, and
   help not a sinner." The latter clause of this sentence seems to forbid
   benevolence; for it says, "help not a sinner." Understand, therefore,
   that "sinner" is put figuratively for sin, so that it is his sin you
   are not to help.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   25. Again, it often happens that a man who has attained, or thinks he
   has attained, to a higher grade of spiritual life, thinks that the
   commands given to those who are still in the lower grades are
   figurative; for example, if he has embraced a life of celibacy and made
   himself a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven's sake, he contends that the
   commands given in Scripture about loving and ruling a wife are not to
   be taken literally, but figuratively; and if he has determined to keep
   his virgin unmarried, he tries to put a figurative interpretation on
   the passage where it is said, "Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou
   have performed a weighty matter." Accordingly, another of our rules for
   understanding the Scriptures will be as follows,--to recognize that
   some commands are given to all in common, others to particular classes
   of persons, that the medicine may act not only upon the state of health
   as a whole, but also upon the special weakness of each member. For that
   which cannot be raised to a higher state must be cared for in its own
   state.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 18

   26. We must also be on our guard against supposing that what in the Old
   Testament, making allowance for the condition of those times, is not a
   crime or a vice even if we take it literally and not figuratively, can
   be transferred to the present time as a habit of life. For no one will
   do this except lust has dominion over him, and endeavours to find
   support for itself in the very Scriptures which were intended to
   overthrow it. And the wretched man does not perceive that such matters
   are recorded with this useful design, that mere of good hope may learn
   the salutary lesson, both that the custom they spurn can be turned to a
   good use, and that which they embrace can be used to condemnation, if
   the use of the former be accompanied with charity, and the use of the
   latter with lust.

   27. For, if it was possible for one man to use many wives with
   chastity, it is possible for another to use one wife with lust. And I
   look with greater approval on the man who uses the fruitfulness of many
   wives for the sake of an ulterior object, than on the man who enjoys
   the body of one wife for its own sake. For in the former case the man
   aims at a useful object suited to the circumstances of the times; in
   the latter case he gratifies a lust which is engrossed in temporal
   enjoyments. And those men to whom the apostle permitted as a matter of
   indulgence to have one wife because of their incontinence, were less
   near to God than those who, though they had each of them numerous
   wives, yet just as a wise man uses food and drink only for the sake of
   bodily health, used marriage only for the sake of offspring. And,
   accordingly, if these last had been still alive at the advent of our
   Lord, when the time not of casting stones away but of gathering them
   together had come, they would have immediately made themselves eunuchs
   for the kingdom of heaven's sake. For there is no difficulty in
   abstaining unless when there is lust in enjoying. And assuredly those
   men of whom I speak knew that wantonness even in regard to wives is
   abuse and intemperance, as is proved by Tobit's prayer when he was
   married to his wife. For he says: "Blessed art Thou, O God of our
   fathers, and blessed is Thy holy and glorious name for ever; let the
   heavens bless Thee, and all Thy creatures. Thou merriest Adam, and
   gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay. . . . And now, O Lord.
   Thou knowest that I take not this my sister for lust, but uprightly:
   therefore have pity on us, O Lord."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   28. But those who, giving the rein to lust, either wander about
   steeping themselves in a multitude of debaucheries, or even in regard
   to one wife not only exceed the measure necessary for the procreation
   of children, but with the shameless license of a sort of slavish
   freedom heap up the filth of a still more beastly excess, such men do
   not believe it possible that the men of ancient times used a number of
   wives with temperance, looking to nothing but the duty, necessary in
   the circumstances of the time, of propagating the race; and what they
   themselves, who are entangled in the meshes of lust, do not accomplish
   in the case of a single wife, they think utterly impossible in the case
   of a number of wives.

   29. But these same men might say that it is not right even to honour
   and praise good and holy men, because they themselves when they are
   honoured and praised, swell with pride, becoming the more eager for the
   emptiest sort of distinction the more frequently and the more widely
   they are blown about on the tongue of flattery, and so become so light
   that a breath of rumour, whether it appear prosperous or adverse, will
   carry them into the whirlpool of vice or dash them on the rocks of
   crime. Let them, then, learn how trying and difficult it is for
   themselves to escape either being caught by the bait of praise, or
   pierced by the stings of insult; but let them not measure others by
   their own standard.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 20

   Let them believe, on the contrary, that the apostles of our faith were
   neither puffed up when they were honoured by men, nor cast down when
   they were despised. And certainly neither sort of temptation was
   wanting to those great men. For they were both cried up by the loud
   praises of believers, and cried down by the slanderous reports of their
   persecutors. But the apostles used all these things, as occasion
   served, and were not corrupted; and in the same way the saints of old
   used their wives with reference to the necessities of their own times,
   and were not in bondage to lust as they are who refuse to believe these
   things.

   30. For if they had been under the influence of any such passion, they
   could never have restrained themselves from implacable hatred towards
   their sons, by whom they knew that their wives and concubines were
   solicited and debauched.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 21

   But when King David had suffered this injury at the hands of his
   impious and unnatural son, he not only bore with him in his mad
   passion, but mourned over him in his death. He certainly was not caught
   in the meshes of carnal jealousy, seeing that it was not his own
   injuries but the sins of his son that moved him. For it was on this
   account he had given orders that his son should not be slain if he were
   conquered in battle, that he might have a place of repentance after he
   was subdued; and when he was baffled in this design, he mourned over
   his son's death, not because of his own loss, but because he knew to
   what punishment so impious an adulterer and parricide had been hurried.
   For prior to this, in the case of another son who had been guilty of no
   crime, though he was dreadfully afflicted for him while he was sick,
   yet he comforted himself after his death.

   31. And with what moderation and self-restraint those men used their
   wives appears chiefly in this, that when this same king, carried away
   by the heat of passion and by temporal prosperity, had taken unlawful
   possession of one woman, whose husband also he ordered to be put to
   death, he was accused of his crime by a prophet, who, when he had come
   to show him his sin set before him the parable of the poor man who had
   but one ewe-lamb, and whose neighbour, though he had many, yet when a
   guest came to him spared to take of his own flock, but set his poor
   neighbour's one lamb before his guest to eat. And David's anger being
   kindled against the man, he commanded that he should be put to death,
   and the lamb restored fourfold to the poor man; thus unwittingly
   condemning the sin he had wittingly committed. And when he had been
   shown this, and God's punishment had been denounced against him, he
   wiped out his sin in deep penitence. But yet in this parable it was the
   adultery only that was indicated by the poor man's ewe-lamb; about the
   killing of the woman's husband,--that is, about the murder of the poor
   man himself who had the one ewe-lamb,--nothing is said in the parable,
   so that the sentence of condemnation is pronounced against the adultery
   alone. And hence we may understand with what temperance he possessed a
   number of wives when he was forced to punish himself for transgressing
   in regard to one woman. But in his case the immoderate desire did not
   take up its abode with him, but was only a passing guest. On this
   account the unlawful appetite is called even by the accusing prophet, a
   guest. For he did not say that he took the poor man's ewe-lamb to make
   a feast for his king, but for his guest. In the case of his son
   Solomon, however, this lust did not come and pass away like a guest,
   but reigned as a king. And about him Scripture is not silent, but
   accuses him of being a lover of strange women; for in the beginning of
   his reign he was inflamed with a desire for wisdom, but after he had
   attained it through spiritual love, he lost it through carnal lust.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 22

   32. Therefore, although all, or nearly all, the transactions recorded
   in the Old Testament are to be taken not literally only, but
   figuratively as well, nevertheless even in the case of those which the
   reader has taken literally, and which, though the authors of them are
   praised, are repugnant to the habits of the good men who since our
   Lord's advent are the custodians of the divine commands, let him refer
   the figure to its interpretation, but let him not transfer the act to
   his habits of life. For many things which were done as duties at that
   time, cannot now be done except through lust.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 23

   33. And when he reads of the sins of great men, although he may be able
   to see and to trace out in them a figure of things to come, let him yet
   put the literal fact to this use also, to teach him not to dare to
   vaunt himself in his own good deeds, and in comparison with his own
   righteousness, to despise others as sinners, when he sees in the case
   of men so eminent both the storms that are to be avoided and the
   shipwrecks that are to be wept over. For the sins of these men were
   recorded to this end, that men might everywhere and always tremble at
   that saying of the apostle: "Wherefore let him that thinketh he
   standeth take heed lest he fall." For there is hardly a page of
   Scripture on which it is not clearly written that God resisteth the
   proud and giveth grace to the humble.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 24

   34. The chief thing to be inquired into, therefore, in regard to any
   expression that we are trying to understand is, whether it is literal
   or figurative. For when it is ascertained to be figurative, it is easy,
   by an application of the laws of things which we discussed in the first
   book, to turn it in every way until we arrive at a true interpretation,
   especially when we bring to our aid experience strengthened by the
   exercise of piety. Now we find out whether an expression is literal or
   figurative by attending to the considerations indicated above.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 25

   And when it is shown to be figurative, the words in which it is
   expressed will be found to be drawn either from like objects or from
   objects having some affinity.

   35. But as there are many ways in which things show a likeness to each
   other, we are not to suppose there is any rule that what a thing
   signifies by similitude in one place it is to be taken to signify in
   all other places. For our Lord used leaven both in a bad sense, as when
   He said, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees," I and in a good
   sense, as when He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven,
   which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole
   was leavened."

   36. Now the rule in regard to this variation has two forms. For things
   that signify now one thing and now another, signify either things that
   are contrary, or things that are only different. They signify
   contraries, for example, when they are used metaphorically at one time
   in a good sense, at another in a bad, as in the case of the leaven
   mentioned above. Another example of the same is that a lion stands for
   Christ in the place where it is said, "The lion of the tribe of Judah
   has prevailed;" and again, stands for the devil where it is written,
   "Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking
   whom he may devour." In the same way the serpent is used in a good
   sense, "Be wise as serpents;" and again, in a bad sense, "The serpent
   beguiled Eve through his subtilty." Bread is used in a good sense, "I
   am the living bread which came down from heaven;" in a bad, "Bread
   eaten in secret is pleasant." And so in a great many other case. The
   examples I have adduced are indeed by no means doubtful in their
   signification, because only plain instances ought to be used as
   examples. There are passages, however, in regard to which it is
   uncertain in what sense they ought to be taken, as for example, "In the
   hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full of
   mixture." Now it is uncertain whether this denotes the wrath of God,
   but not to the last extremity of punishment, that is, "to the very
   dregs;" or whether it denotes the grace of the Scriptures passing away
   from the Jews and coming to the Gentiles, because "He has put down one
   and set up another,"--certain observances, however, which they
   understand in a carnal manner, still remaining among the Jews, for "the
   dregs hereof is not yet wrung out." The following is an example of the
   same object being taken, not in opposite, but only in different
   significations: water denotes people, as we read in the Apocalypse, and
   also the Holy Spirit, as for example, "Out of his belly shall flow
   rivers of living water;" and many other things besides water must be
   interpreted according to the place in which they are found.

   37. And in the same way other objects are not single in their
   signification, but each one of them denotes not two only but sometimes
   even several different things, according to the connection in which it
   is found.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 26

   Now from the places where the sense in which they are used is more
   manifest we must gather the sense in which they are to be understood in
   obscure passages. For example, there is no better way of understanding
   the words addressed to God, "Take hold of shield and buckler and stand
   up for mine help," than by referring to the passage where we read,
   "Thou, Lord, hast crowned us with Thy favour as with a shield." And yet
   we are not so to understand it, as that wherever we meet with a shield
   put to indicate a protection of any kind, we must take it as signifying
   nothing but the favour of God. For we hear also of the shield of faith,
   "wherewith," says the apostle, "ye shall be able to quench all the
   fiery darts of the wicked." Nor ought we, on the other hand, in regard
   to spiritual armour of this kind to assign faith to the shield only;
   for we read in another place of the breastplate of faith: "putting on,"
   says the apostle, "the breastplate of faith and love."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 27

   38. When, again, not some one interpretation, but two or more
   interpretations are put upon the same words of Scripture, even though
   the meaning the writer intended remain undiscovered, there is no danger
   if it can be shown from other passages of Scripture that any of the
   interpretations put on the words is in harmony with the truth. And if a
   man in searching the Scriptures endeavours to get at the intention of
   the author through whom the Holy Spirit spake, whether he succeeds in
   this endeavour, or whether he draws a different meaning from the words,
   but one that is not opposed to sound doctrine, he is free from blame so
   long as he is supported by the testimony of some other passage of
   Scripture. For the author perhaps saw that this very meaning lay in the
   words which we are trying to interpret; and assuredly the Holy Spirit,
   who through him spake these words, foresaw that this interpretation
   would occur to the reader, nay, made provision that it should occur to
   him, seeing that it too is founded on truth. For what more liberal and
   more fruitful provision could God have made in regard to the Sacred
   Scriptures than that the same words might be understood in several
   senses, all of which are sanctioned by the concurring testimony of
   other passages equally divine?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 28

   39. When, however, a meaning is evolved of such a kind that what is
   doubtful in it cannot be cleared up by indubitable evidence from
   Scripture, it remains for us to make it clear by the evidence of
   reason. But this is a dangerous practice. For it is far safer to walk
   by the light of Holy Scripture; so that when we wish to examine the
   passages that are obscured by metaphorical expressions, we may either
   obtain a meaning about which there is no controversy, or if a
   controversy arises, may settle it by the application of testimonies
   sought out in every portion of the same Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 29

   40. Moreover, I would have learned men to know that the authors of our
   Scriptures use all those forms of expression which grammarians call by
   the Greek name tropes, and use them more freely and in greater variety
   than people who are unacquainted with the Scriptures, and have learnt
   these figures of speech from other writings, can imagine or believe.
   Nevertheless those who know these tropes recognize them in Scripture,
   and are very much assisted by their knowledge of them in understanding
   Scripture. But this is not the place to teach them to the illiterate,
   lest it might seem that I was teaching grammar. I certainly advise,
   however, that they be learnt elsewhere, although indeed I have already
   given that advice above, in the second book namely, where I treated of
   the necessary knowledge of languages. For the written characters from
   which grammar itself gets its name (the Greek name for letters being
   "grammata") are the signs of sounds made by the articulate voice with
   which we speak. Now of some of these figures of speech we find in
   Scripture not only examples (which we have of them all), but the very
   names as well: for instance, allegory, enigma, and parable. However,
   nearly all these tropes which are said to be learnt as a matter of
   liberal education are found even in the ordinary speech of men who have
   learnt no grammar, but are content to use the vulgar idiom. For who
   does not say, "So may you flourish? " And this is the figure of speech
   called metaphor. Who does not speak of a fish-pond in which there is no
   fish, which was not made for fish, and yet gets its name from fish? And
   this is the figure called catachresis.

   41. It would be tedious to go over all the rest in this way; for the
   speech of the vulgar makes use of them all, even of those more curious
   figures which mean the very opposite of what they say, as for example,
   those called irony and antiphrasis. Now in irony we indicate by the
   tone of voice the meaning we desire to convey; as when we say to a man
   who is behaving badly, "You are doing well." But it is not by the tone
   of voice that we make an antiphrasis to indicate the opposite of what
   the words convey; but either the words in which it is expressed are
   used in the opposite of their etymological sense, as a grove is called
   lucus from its want of light; or it is customary to use a certain form
   of expression, although it puts yes for no by a law of contraries, as
   when we ask in a place for what is not there, and get the answer,
   "There is plenty;" or we add words that make it plain we mean the
   opposite of what we say, as in the expression, "Beware of him, for he
   is a good man." And what illiterate man is there that does not use such
   expressions, although he knows nothing at all about either the nature
   or the names of these figures of speech? And yet the knowledge of these
   is necessary for clearing up the difficulties of Scripture; because
   when the words taken literally give an absurd meaning, we ought
   forthwith to inquire whether they may not be used in this or that
   figurative sense which we are unacquainted with; and in this way many
   obscure passages have had light thrown upon them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 30

   42. One Tichonius, who, although a Donatist himself, has written most
   triumphantly against the Donatists (and herein showed himself of a most
   inconsistent disposition, that he was unwilling to give them up
   altogether), wrote a book which he called the Book of Rules, because in
   it he laid down seven rules, which are, as it were, keys to open the
   secrets of Scripture. And of these rules, the first relates to the Lord
   and His body, the second to the twofold division of the Lord's body,
   the third to the promises and the law, the fourth to species and genus,
   the fifth to times, the sixth to recapitulation, the seventh to the
   devil and his body. Now these rules, as expounded by their author, do
   indeed, when carefully considered, afford considerable assistance in
   penetrating the secrets of the sacred writings; but still they do not
   explain all the difficult passages for there are several other methods
   required which are so far from being embraced in this number of seven,
   that the author himself explains many obscure passages without using
   any of his rules; finding, indeed, that there was no need for them, as
   there was no difficulty in the passage of the kind to which his rules
   apply. As, for example, he inquires what we are to understand in the
   Apocalypse by the seven angels of the churches to whom John is
   commanded to write; and after much and various reasoning, arrives at
   the conclusion that the angels are the churches themselves. And
   throughout this long and full discussion, although the matter inquired
   into is certainly very obscure, no use whatever is made of the rules.
   This is enough for an example, for it would be too tedious and
   troublesome to collect all the passages in the canonical Scriptures
   which present obscurities of such a kind as require none of these seven
   rules for their elucidation.

   43. The author himself, however, when commending these rules,
   attributes so much value to them that it would appear as if, when they
   were thoroughly known and duly applied, we should be able to interpret
   all the obscure passages in the law--that is, in the sacred books. For
   he thus commences this very book: "Of all the things that occur to me,
   I consider none so necessary as to write a little book of rules, and,
   as it were, to make keys for, and put windows in, the secret places of
   the law. For there are certain mystical rules which hold the key to the
   secret recesses of the whole law, and render visible the treasures of
   truth that are to many invisible. And if this system of rules be
   received as I communicate it, without jealousy, what is shut shall be
   laid open, and what is obscure shall be elucidated, so that a man
   travelling through the vast forest of prophecy shall, if he follow
   these rules as pathways of light, be preserved from going astray." Now,
   if he had said, "There are certain mystical rules which hold the key to
   some of the secrets of the law," or even "which hold the key to the
   great secrets of the law," and not what he does say, "the secret
   recesses of the whole law;" and if he had not said "What is shut shall
   be laid open," but, "Many things that are shut shall be laid open," he
   would have said what was true, and he would not, by attributing more
   than is warranted by the facts to his very elaborate and useful work,
   have led the reader into false expectations. And I have thought it
   right to say thus much, in order both that the book may be read by the
   studious (for it is of very great assistance in understanding
   Scripture), and that no more may be expected from it than it really
   contains. Certainly it must be read with caution, not only on account
   of the errors into which the author falls as a man, but chiefly on
   account of the heresies which he advances as a Donatist. And now I
   shall briefly indicate what these seven rules teach or advise.

  Chapter 31

   44. The first is about the Lord and His body, and it is this, that,
   knowing as we do that the head and the body--that is, Christ and His
   Church--are sometimes indicated to us under one person (for it is not
   in vain that it is said to believers, "Ye then are Abraham's seed,"
   when there is but one seed of Abraham, and that is Christ), we need not
   be in a difficulty when a transition is made from the head to the body
   or from the body to the head, and yet no change made in the person
   spoken of. For a single person is represented as saying, "He has decked
   me as a bridegroom with ornaments, and adorned me as a bride with
   jewels;" and yet it is, of course, a matter for interpretation which of
   these two refers to the head and which to the body, that is, which to
   Christ and which to the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 32

   45. The second rule is about the twofold division of the body of the
   Lord; but this indeed is not a suitable name, for that is really no
   part of the body of Christ which will not be with Him in eternity. We
   ought, therefore, to say that the rule is about the true and the mixed
   body of the Lord, or the true and the counterfeit, or some such name;
   because, not to speak of eternity, hypocrites cannot even now be said
   to be in Him, although they seem to be in His Church. And hence this
   rule might be designated thus: Concerning the mixed Church. Now this
   rule requires the reader to be on his guard when Scripture, although it
   has now come to address or speak of a different set of persons, seems
   to be addressing or speaking of the same persons as before, just as if
   both sets constituted one body in consequence of their being for the
   time united in a common participation of the sacraments. An example of
   this is that passage in the Song of Solomon, "I am black, but comely,
   as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon." For it is not said,
   I *was* black as the tents of Cedar, but am *now* comely as the
   curtains of Solomon. The Church declares itself to be at present both;
   and this because the good fish and the bad are for the time mixed up in
   the one net. For the tents of Cedar pertain to Ishmael, who "shall not
   be heir with the son of the free woman." And in the same way, when God
   says of the good part of the Church, "I will bring the blind by a way
   that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known;
   I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight:
   these things will I do unto them, and not forsake them;" He immediately
   adds in regard to the other part, the bad that is mixed with the good,
   "They shall be turned back." Now these words refer to a set of persons
   altogether different from the former; but as the two sets are for the
   present united in one body, He speaks as if there were no change in the
   subject of the sentence. They will not, however, always he in one body;
   for one of them is that wicked servant of whom we are told in the
   gospel, whose lord, when he comes, "shall cut him asunder and appoint
   him his portion with the hypocrites."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 33

   46. The third rule relates to the promises and the law, and may be
   designated in other terms as relating to the spirit and the letter,
   which is the name I made use of when writing a book on this subject. It
   may be also named, of grace and the law. This, however, seems to me to
   be a great question in itself, rather than a rule to be applied to the
   solution of other questions. It was the want of clear views on this
   question that originated, or at least greatly aggravated, the Pelagian
   heresy. And the efforts of Tichonius to clear up this point were good,
   but not complete. For, in discussing the question about faith and
   works, he said that works were given us by God as the reward of faith,
   but that faith itself was so far our own that it did not come to us
   from God; not keeping in mind the saying of the apostle: "Peace be to
   the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord
   Jesus Christ." But he had not come into contact with this heresy, which
   has arisen in our time, and has given us much labour and trouble in
   defending against it the grace of God which is through our Lord Jesus
   Christ and which (according to the saying of the apostle, "There must
   be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made
   manifest among you" has made us much more watchful and diligent to
   discover in Scripture what escaped Tichonius, who, having no enemy to
   guard against, was less attentive and anxious on this point, namely,
   that even faith itself is the gift of Him who "has dealt to every man
   the measure of faith." Whence it is said to certain believers: "Unto
   you it is given, in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him,
   but also to suffer for His sake." Who, then, can doubt that each of
   these is the gift of God, when he learns from this passage, and
   believes, that each of them is given? There are many other testimonies
   besides which prove this. But I am not now treating of this doctrine. I
   have, however, dealt with it, one place or another, very frequently.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 34

   47. The fourth rule of Tichonius is about species and genus. For so he
   calls it, intending that by species should be understood a part, by
   genus the whole of which that which he calls species is a part: as, for
   example, every single city is a part of the great society of nations:
   the city he calls a species, all nations constitute the genus. There is
   no necessity for here applying that subtilty of distinction which is in
   use among logicians, who discuss with great acuteness the difference
   between a part and a species. The rule is of course the same, if
   anything of the kind referred to is found in Scripture, not in regard
   to a single city, but in regard to a single province, or tribe, or
   kingdom. Not only, for example, about Jerusalem, or some of the cities
   of the Gentiles, such as Tyre or Babylon, are things said in Scripture
   whose significance oversteps the limits of the city, and which are more
   suitable when applied to all nations; but in regard to Judea also, and
   Egypt, and Assyria, or any other nation you choose to take which
   contains numerous cities, but still is not the whole world, but only a
   part of it, things are said which pass over the limits of that
   particular country, and apply more fitly to the whole of which this is
   a part; or, as our author terms it, to the genus of which this is a
   species. And hence these words have come to be commonly known, so that
   even uneducated people understand what is laid down specially, and what
   generally, in any given Imperial command. The same thing occurs in the
   case of men: things are said of Solomon, for example, the scope of
   which reaches far beyond him, and which are only properly understood
   when applied to Christ and His Church, of which Solomon is a part.

   48. Now the species is not always overstepped, for things are often
   said of such a kind as evidently apply to it also, or perhaps even to
   it exclusively. But when Scripture, having up to a certain point been
   speaking about the species, makes a transition at that point from the
   species to the genus, the reader must then be carefully on his guard
   against seeking in the species what he can find much better and more
   surely in the genus. Take, for example, what the prophet Ezekiel says:
   "When the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by
   their own way, and by their doings: their way was before me as the
   uncleanness of a removed woman. Wherefore I poured my fury upon them
   for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols
   wherewith they had polluted it: and I scattered them among the heathen,
   and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way,
   and according to their doings, I judged them." Now it is easy to
   understand that this applies to that house of Israel of which the
   apostle says "Behold Israel after the flesh;" because the people of
   Israel after the flesh did both perform and endure all that is here
   referred to. What immediately follows, too, may be understood as
   applying to the same peep]e. But when the prophet begins to say, "And I
   will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen,
   which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know
   that I am the Lord," the reader ought now carefully to observe the way
   in which the species is overstepped and the genus taken in. For he goes
   on to say: "And I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. For I
   will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all
   countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then will I sprinkle
   clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness,
   and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I
   give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away
   the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh.
   And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
   statutes, and ye shall keep my commandments, and do them. And ye shall
   dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my
   people, and I will be your God. I will also save you from all your
   uncleannesses." Now that this is a prophecy of the New Testament, to
   which pertain not only the remnant of that one nation of which it is
   elsewhere said, "For though the number of the children of Israel be as
   the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall be saved," but also
   the other nations which were promised to their fathers and our fathers;
   and that there is here a promise of that washing of regeneration which,
   as we see, is now imparted to all nations, no one who looks into the
   matter can doubt. And that saying of the apostle, when he is commending
   the grace of the New Testament and its excellence in comparison with
   the Old, "Ye are our epistle . . . written not with ink, but with the
   Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
   of the heart," has an evident reference to this place where the prophet
   says, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
   within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and
   I will give you an heart of flesh." Now the heart of flesh from which
   the apostle's expression, "the fleshy tables of the heart," is drawn,
   the prophet intended to point out as distinguished from the stony heart
   by the possession of sentient life; and by sentient he understood
   intelligent life. And thus the spiritual Israel is made up, not of one
   nation, but of all the nations which were promised to the fathers in
   their seed, that is, in Christ.

   49. This spiritual Israel, therefore, is distinguished from the carnal
   Israel which is of one nation, by newness of grace, not by nobility of
   descent, in feeling, not in race; but the prophet, in his depth of
   meaning, while speaking of the carnal Israel, passes on, without
   indicating the transition, to speak of the spiritual, and although now
   speaking of the latter, seems to be still speaking of the former; not
   that he grudges us the clear apprehension of Scripture, as if we were
   enemies, but that he deals with us as a physician, giving us a
   wholesome exercise for our spirit. And therefore we ought to take this
   saying "And I will bring you into your own land," and what he says
   shortly afterwards, as if repeating himself, "And ye shall dwell in the
   land that I gave to your fathers," not literally, as if they referred
   to Israel after the flesh but spiritually, as referring to the
   spiritual Israel. For the Church, without spot or wrinkle, gathered out
   of all nations, and destined to reign forever with Christ, is itself
   the land of the blessed, the land of the living; and we are to
   understand that this was given to the fathers when it was promised to
   them in the sure and immutable purpose of God; for what the fathers
   believed would be given in its own time was to them, on account of the
   unchangeableness of the promise and purpose, the same as if it were
   already given; just as the apostle, writing to Timothy, speaks of the
   grace which is given to the saints: "Not according to our works, but
   according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ
   Jesus before the world began; but is now made manifest by the appearing
   of our Saviour." He speaks of the grace as given at a time when those
   to whom it was to be given were not yet in existence; because he looks
   upon that as having been already done in the arrangement and purpose of
   God, which was to take place in its own time, and he himself speaks of
   it as now made manifest. It is possible, however, that these words may
   refer to the land of the age to come, when there will be a new heaven
   and a new earth, wherein the unrighteous shall be unable to dwell. And
   so it is truly said to the righteous, that the land itself is theirs,
   no part of which will belong to the unrighteous; because it is the same
   as if it were itself given, when it is firmly settled that it shall be
   given.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 35

   50. The fifth rule Tichonius lays down is one he designates of
   times,--a rule by which we can frequently discover or conjecture
   quantities of time which are not expressly mentioned in Scripture. And
   he says that this rule applies in two ways: either to the figure of
   speech called synecdoche, or to legitimate numbers. The figure
   synecdoche either puts the part for the whole, or the whole for the
   part. As, for example, in reference to the time when, in the presence
   of only three of His disciples, our Lord was transfigured on the mount,
   so that His face shone as the sun, and His raiment was white as snow,
   one evangelist says that this event occurred "after eight days," while
   another says that it occurred "after six days." Now both of these
   statements about the number of days cannot be true, unless we suppose
   that the writer who says "after eight days," counted the latter part of
   the day on which Christ uttered the prediction and the first part of
   the day on which he showed its fulfilment as two whole days; while the
   writer who says "after six days," counted only the whole unbroken days
   between these two. This figure of speech, which puts the part for the
   whole, explains also the great question about the resurrection of
   Christ. For unless to the latter part of the day on which He suffered
   we join the previous night, and count it as a whole day, and to the
   latter part of the night in which He arose we join the Lord's day which
   was just dawning, and count it also a whole day, we cannot make out the
   three days and three nights during which He foretold that He would be
   in the heart of the earth.

   51. In the next place, our author calls those numbers legitimate which
   Holy Scripture more highly favours, such as seven, or ten, or twelve,
   or any of the other numbers which the diligent reader of Scripture soon
   comes to know. Now numbers of this sort are often put for time
   universal; as, for example, "Seven times in the day do I praise Thee,"
   means just the same as "His praise shall continually be in my mouth."
   And their force is exactly the same, either when multiplied by ten, as
   seventy and seven hundred (whence the seventy years mentioned in
   Jeremiah may be taken in a spiritual sense for the whole time during
   which the Church is a sojourner among aliens); or when multiplied into
   themselves, as ten into ten gives one hundred, and twelve into twelve
   gives one hundred and forty-four, which last number is used in the
   Apocalypse to signify the whole body of the saints. Hence it appears
   that it is not merely questions about times that are to be settled by
   these numbers, but that their significance is of much wider
   application, and extends to many subjects. That number in the
   Apocalypse, for example, mentioned above, has not reference to times,
   but to men.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 36

   52. The sixth rule Tichonius calls the recapitulation, which, with
   sufficient watchfulness, is discovered in difficult parts of Scripture.
   For certain occurrences are so related, that the narrative appears to
   be following the order of time, or the continuity of events, when it
   really goes back without mentioning it to previous occurrences, which
   had been passed over in their proper place. And we make mistakes if we
   do not understand this, from applying the rule here spoken of. For
   example, in the book of Genesis we read, "And the Lord God planted a
   garden eastwards in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed.
   And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is
   pleasant to the sight, and good for food." Now here it seems to be
   indicated that the events last mentioned took place after God had
   formed man and put him in the garden; whereas the fact is, that the two
   events having been briefly mentioned, viz., that God planted a garden,
   and there put the man whom He had formed, the narrative goes back, by
   way of recapitulation, to tell what had before been omitted, the way in
   which the garden was planted: that out of the ground God made to grow
   every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. Here there
   follows "The tree of life also was in the midst of the garden, and the
   tree of knowledge of good and evil." Next the river is mentioned which
   watered the garden, and which was parted into four heads, the sources
   of four streams; and all this has reference to the arrangements of the
   garden. And when this is finished, there is a repetition of the fact
   which had been already told, but which in the strict order of events
   came after all this: "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into
   the garden of Eden." For it was after all these other things were done
   that man was put in the garden, as now appears from the order of the
   narrative itself: it was not after man was put there that the other
   things were done, as the previous statement might be thought to imply,
   did we not accurately mark and understand the recapitulation by which
   the narrative reverts to what had previously been passed over.

   53. In the same book, again, when the generations of the sons of Noah
   are recounted, it is said: "These are the sons of Ham, after their
   families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their
   nations." And, again, when the sons of Shem are enumerated: "These are
   the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their
   lands, after their nations." And it is added in reference to them all:
   "These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
   in their nations; and by these were the nations divided in the earth
   after the flood. And the whole earth was of one language and of one
   speech." Now the addition of this sentence, "And the whole earth was of
   one language and of one speech," seems to indicate that at the time
   when the nations were scattered over the earth they had all one
   language in common; but this is evidently inconsistent with the
   previous words, in their families, after their tongues." For each
   family or nation could not be said to have its own language if all had
   one language in common. And so it is by way of recapitulation it is
   added, "And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech," the
   narrative here going back, without indicating the change, to tell how
   it was, that from having one language in common, the nations were
   divided into a multitude of tongues. And, accordingly, we are forthwith
   told of the building of the tower, and of this punishment being there
   laid upon them as the judgment of God upon their arrogance; and it was
   after this that they were scattered over the earth according to their
   tongues.

   54. This recapitulation is found in a still more obscure form; as, for
   example, our Lord says in the gospel: "The same day that Lot went out
   of Sodom it rained fire from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus
   shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. In that day, he
   which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him
   not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him
   likewise not return back. Remember Lot's wife." Is it when our Lord
   shall have been revealed that men are to give heed to these sayings,
   and not to look behind them, that is, not to long after the past life
   which they have renounced? Is not the present rather the time to give
   heed to them, that when the Lord shall have been revealed every man may
   receive his reward according to the things he has given heed to or
   despised? And yet because Scripture says, "In that day," the time of
   the revelation of the Lord will be thought the time for giving heed to
   these sayings, unless the reader be watchful and intelligent so as to
   understand the recapitulation, in which he will be assisted by that
   other passage of Scripture which even in the time of the apostles
   proclaimed: "Little children, it is the last time." The very time then
   when the gospel is preached, up to the time that the Lord shall be
   revealed. is the day in which men ought to give heed to these sayings:
   for to the same day, which shall be brought to a close by a day of
   judgment, belongs that very revelation of the Lord here spoken of.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 37

   55. The seventh rule of Tichonius and the last, is about the devil and
   his body. For he is the head of the wicked, who are in a sense his
   body, and destined to go with him into the punishment of everlasting
   fire, just as Christ is the head of the Church, which is His body,
   destined to be with Him in His eternal kingdom and glory. Accordingly,
   as the first rule, which is called of the Lord and His body, directs
   us, when Scripture speaks of one and the same person, to take pains to
   understand which part of the statement applies to the head and which to
   the body; so this last rule shows us that statements are sometimes made
   about the devil, whose truth is not so evident in regard to himself as
   in regard to his body; and his body is made up not only of those who
   are manifestly out of the way, but of those also who, though they
   really belong to him, are for a time mixed up with the Church, until
   they depart from this life, or until the chaff is separated from the
   wheat at the last great winnowing. For example, what is said in Isaiah,
   "How he is fallen from heaven, Lucifer, son of the morning! " and the
   other statements of the context which, under the figure of the king of
   Babylon, are made about the same person, are of course to be understood
   of the devil; and yet the statement which is made in the same place,
   "He is ground down on the earth, who sendeth to all nations," does not
   altogether fitly apply to the head himself. For, although the devil
   sends his angels to all nations, yet it is his body, not himself, that
   is ground down on the earth, except that he himself is in his body,
   which is beaten small like the dust which the wind blows from the face
   of the earth.

   56. Now all these rules, except the one about the promises and the law,
   make one meaning to be understood where another is expressed, which is
   the peculiarity of figurative diction; and this kind of diction, it
   seems to me, is too widely spread to be comprehended in its full extent
   by any one. For, wherever one thing is said with the intention that
   another should be understood we have a figurative expression, even
   though the name of the trope is not to be found in the art of rhetoric.
   And when an expression of this sort occurs where it is customary to
   find it, there is no trouble in understanding it; when it occurs,
   however, where it is not customary, it costs labour to understand it,
   from some more, from some less, just as men have got more or less from
   God of the gifts of intellect, or as they have access to more or fewer
   external helps. And, as in the case of proper words which I discussed
   above, and in which things are to be understood just as they are
   expressed, so in the case of figurative words, in which one thing is
   expressed and another is to be understood, and which I have just
   finished speaking of as much as I thought enough, students of these
   venerable documents ought to be counselled not only to make themselves
   acquainted with the forms of expression ordinarily used in Scripture,
   to observe them carefully, and to remember them accurately, but also,
   what is especially and before all things necessary, to pray that they
   may understand them. For in these very books on the study of which they
   are intent, they read, "The Lord giveth wisdom: out of His mouth comets
   knowledge and understanding;" and it is from Him they have received
   their very desire for knowledge, if it is wedded to piety. But about
   signs, so far as relates to words, I have now said enough. It remains
   to discuss, in the following book, so far as God has given me light,
   the means of communicating our thoughts to others.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   Passing to the second part of his work, that which treats of
   expression, the author premises that it is no part of his intention to
   write a treatise on the laws of rhetoric. These can be learned
   elsewhere, and ought not to be neglected, being indeed specially
   necessary for the Christian teacher, whom it behoves to excel in
   eloquence and power of speech. After detailing with much care and
   minuteness the various qualities of an orator, he recommends the
   authors of the Holy Scriptures as the best models of eloquence, far
   excelling all others in the combination of eloquence with wisdom. He
   points out that perspicuity is the most essential quality of style, and
   ought to be cultivated with especial care by the teacher, as it is the
   main requisite for instruction, although other qualities are required
   for delighting and persuading the hearer. All these gifts are to be
   sought in earnest prayer from God, though we are not to forget to be
   zealous and diligent in study. He shows that there are three species of
   style,--the subdued, the elegant, and the majestic; the first serving
   for instruction, the second for praise, and the third for exhortation:
   and of each of these he gives examples, selected both from Scripture
   and from early teachers of the Church, Cyprian and Ambrose. He shows
   that these various styles may be mingled, and when and for what
   purposes they are mingled; and that they all have the same end in view,
   to bring home the truth to the hearer, so that he may understand it,
   hear it with gladness, and practice it in his life. Finally, he exhorts
   the Christian teacher himself, pointing out the dignity and
   responsibility of the office he holds, to lead a life in harmony with
   his own teaching, and to show a good example to all.

  Chapter 1

   1. This work of mine, which is entitled On Christian Doctrine, was at
   the commencement divided into two parts. For, after a preface, in which
   I answered by anticipation those who were likely to take exception to
   the work, I said, "There are two things on which all interpretation of
   Scripture depends: the mode of ascertaining the proper meaning, and the
   mode of making known the meaning when it is ascertained. I shall treat
   first of the mode of ascertaining, next of the mode of making known the
   meaning." As, then, I have already said a great deal about the mode of
   ascertaining the meaning, and have given three books to this one part
   of the subject, I shall only say a few things about the mode of making
   known the meaning, in order if possible to bring them all within the
   compass of one book, and so finish the whole work in four books.

   2. In the first place, then, I wish by this preamble to put a stop to
   the expectations of readers who may think that I am about to lay down
   rules of rhetoric such as I have learnt, and taught too, in the secular
   schools, and to warn them that they need not look for any such from me.
   Not that I think such rules of no use, but that whatever use they have
   is to be learnt elsewhere; and if any good man should happen to have
   leisure for learning them, he is not to ask me to teach them either in
   this work or any other.

   3. Now, the art of rhetoric being available for the enforcing either of
   truth or falsehood, who will dare to say that truth in the person of
   its defenders is to take its stand unarmed against falsehood? For
   example, that those who are trying to persuade men of what is false are
   to know how to introduce their subject, so as to put the hearer into a
   friendly, or attentive, or teachable frame of mind, while the defenders
   of the truth shall be ignorant of that art? That the former are to tell
   their falsehoods briefly, clearly, and plausibly, while the latter
   shall tell the truth in such a way that it is tedious to listen to,
   hard to understand, and, in fine, not easy to believe it? That the
   former are to oppose the truth and defend falsehood with sophistical
   arguments, while the latter shall be unable either to defend what is
   true, or to refute what is false? That the former, while imbuing the
   minds of their hearers with erroneous opinions, are by their power of
   speech to awe, to melt, to enliven, and to rouse them, while the latter
   shall in defense of the truth be sluggish, and frigid, and somnolent?
   Who is such a fool as to think this wisdom? Since, then, the faculty of
   eloquence is available for both sides, and is of very great service in
   the enforcing either of wrong or right, why do not good men study to
   engage it on the side of truth, when bad men use it to obtain the
   triumph of wicked and worthless causes, and to further injustice and
   error?

  Chapter 3

   4. But the theories and rules on this subject (to which, when you add a
   tongue thoroughly skilled by exercise and habit in the use of many
   words and many ornaments of speech, you have what is called eloquence
   or oratory) may be learnt apart from these writings of mine, if a
   suitable space of time be set aside for the purpose at a fit and proper
   age. But only by those who can learn them quickly; for the masters of
   Roman eloquence themselves did not shrink from sayings any one who
   cannot learn this art quickly can never thoroughly learn it at all.
   Whether this be true or not, why need we inquire? For even if this art
   can occasionally be in the end mastered by men of slower intellect, I
   do not think it of so much importance as to wish men who have arrived
   at mature age to spend time in learning it. It is enough that boys
   should give attention to it; and even of these, not all who are to be
   fitted for usefulness in the Church, but only those who are not yet
   engaged in any occupation of more urgent necessity, or which ought
   evidently to take precedence of it. For men of quick intellect and
   glowing temperament find it easier to become eloquent by reading and
   listening to eloquent speakers than by following rules for eloquence.
   And even outside the canon, which to our great advantage is fixed in a
   place of secure authority, there is no want of ecclesiastical writings,
   in reading which a man of ability will acquire a tinge of the eloquence
   with which they are written, even though he does not aim at this, but
   is solely intent on the matters treated of; especially, of course, if
   in addition he practice himself in writing, or dictating, and at last
   also in speaking, the opinions he has formed on grounds of piety and
   faith. If, however, such ability be wanting, the rules of rhetoric are
   either not understood, or if, after great labour has been spent in
   enforcing them, they come to be in some small measure understood, they
   prove of no service. For even those who have learnt them, and who speak
   with fluency and elegance, cannot always think of them when they are
   speaking so as to speak in accordance with them, unless they are
   discussing the rules themselves. Indeed, I think there are scarcely any
   who can do both things that is, speak well, and, in order to do this,
   think of the rules of speaking while they are speaking. For we must be
   careful that what we have got to say does not escape us whilst we are
   thinking about saying it according to the rules of art. Nevertheless,
   in the speeches of eloquent men, we find rules of eloquence carried out
   which the speakers did not think of as aids to eloquence at the time
   when they were speaking, whether they had ever learnt them, or whether
   they had never even met with them. For it is because they are eloquent
   that they exemplify these rules; it is not that they use them in order
   to be eloquent.

   5. And, therefore, as infants cannot learn to speak except by learning
   words and phrases from those who do speak, why should not men become
   eloquent without being taught any art of speech, simply by reading and
   learning the speeches of eloquent men, and by imitating them as far as
   they can? And what do we find from the examples themselves to be the
   case in this respect? We know numbers who, without acquaintance with
   rhetorical rules, are more eloquent than many who have learnt these;
   but we know no one who is eloquent without having read and listened to
   the speeches and debates of eloquent men. For even the art of grammar,
   which teaches correctness of speech, need not be learnt by boys, if
   they have the advantage of growing up and living among men who speak
   correctly. For without knowing the names of any of the faults, they
   will, from being accustomed to correct speech, lay hold upon whatever
   is faulty in the speech of any one they listen to, and avoid it; just
   as city-bred men, even when illiterate, seize upon the faults of
   rustics.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   6. It is the duty, then, of the interpreter and teacher of Holy
   Scripture, the defender of the true faith and the opponent of error,
   both to teach what is right and to refute what is wrong, and in the
   performance of this task to conciliate the hostile, to rouse the
   careless, and to tell the ignorant both what is occurring at present
   and what is probable in the future. But once that his hearers are
   friendly, attentive, and ready to learn, whether he has found them so,
   or has himself made them so, the remaining objects are to be carried
   out in whatever way the case requires. If the hearers need teaching,
   the matter treated of must be made fully known by means of narrative.
   On the other hand, to clear up points that are doubtful requires
   reasoning and the exhibition of proofs. If, however, the hearers
   require to be roused rather than instructed, in order that they may be
   diligent to do what they already know, and to bring their feelings into
   harmony with the truths they admit, greater vigour of speech is needed.
   Here entreaties and reproaches, exhortations and upbraidings, and all
   the other means of rousing the emotions, are necessary.

   7. And all the methods I have mentioned are constantly used by nearly
   every one in cases where speech is the agency employed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   But as some men employ these coarsely, inelegantly, and frigidly while
   others use them with acuteness, elegance, and spirit, the work that I
   am speaking of ought to be undertaken by one who can argue and speak
   with wisdom, if not with eloquence, and with profit to his hearers,
   even though he profit them less than he would if he could speak with
   eloquence too. But we must beware of the man who abounds in eloquent
   nonsense, and so much the more if the hearer is pleased with what is
   not worth listening to, and thinks that because the speaker is eloquent
   what he says must be true. And this opinion is held even by those who
   think that the art of rhetoric should be taught: for they confess that
   "though wisdom without eloquence is of little service to states, yet
   eloquence without wisdom is frequently a positive injury, and is of
   service never." If, then, the men who teach the principles of eloquence
   have been forced by truth to confess this in the very books which treat
   of eloquence, though they were ignorant of the true, that is, the
   heavenly wisdom which comes down from the Father of Lights, how much
   more ought we to feel it who are the sons and the ministers of this
   higher wisdom! Now a man speaks with more or less wisdom just as he has
   made more or less progress in the knowledge of Scripture; I do not mean
   by reading them much and committing them to memory, but by
   understanding them aright and carefully searching into their meaning.
   For there are who read and yet neglect them; they read to remember the
   words, but are careless about knowing the meaning. It is plain we must
   set far above these the men who are not so retentive of the words, but
   see with the eyes of the heart into the heart of Scripture. Better than
   either of these, however, is the man who, when he wishes, can repeat
   the words, and at the same time correctly apprehends their meaning.

   8. Now it is especially necessary for the man who is bound to speak
   wisely, even though he cannot speak eloquently, to retain in memory the
   words of Scripture. For the more he discerns the poverty of his own
   speech, the more he ought to draw on the riches of Scripture, so that
   what he says in his own words he may prove by the words of Scripture;
   and he himself, though small and weak in his own words, may gain
   strength and power from the confirming testimony of great men. For his
   proof gives pleasure when he cannot please by his mode of speech. But
   if a man desire to speak not only with wisdom, but with eloquence also
   (and assuredly he will prove of greater service if he can do both), I
   would rather send him to read, and listen to, and exercise himself in
   imitating, eloquent men, than advise him to spend time with the
   teachers of rhetoric; especially if the men he reads and listens to are
   justly praised as having spoken, or as being accustomed to speak, not
   only with eloquence, but with wisdom also. For eloquent speakers are
   heard with pleasure; wise speakers with profit. And, therefore,
   Scripture does not say that the multitude of the eloquent, but "the
   multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world." And as we must
   often swallow wholesome bitters, so we must always avoid unwholesome
   sweets. But what is better than wholesome sweetness or sweet
   wholesomeness? For the sweeter we try to make such things, the easier
   it is to make their wholesomeness serviceable. And so there are writers
   of the Church who have expounded the Holy Scriptures, not only with
   wisdom, but with eloquence as well; and there is not more time for the
   reading of these than is sufficient for those who are studious and at
   leisure to exhaust them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   9. Here, perhaps, some one inquires whether the authors whose
   divinely-inspired writings constitute the canon, which carries with it
   a most wholesome authority, are to be considered wise only, or eloquent
   as well. A question which to me, and to those who think with me, is
   very easily settled. For where I understand these writers, it seems to
   me not only that nothing can be wiser, but also that nothing can be
   more eloquent. And I venture to affirm that all who truly understand
   what these writers say, perceive at the same time that it could not
   have been properly said in any other way. For as there is a kind of
   eloquence that is more becoming in youth, and a kind that is more
   becoming in old age, and nothing can be called eloquence if it be not
   suitable to the person of the speaker, so there is a kind of eloquence
   that is becoming in men who justly claim the highest authority, and who
   are evidently inspired of God. With this eloquence they spoke; no other
   would have been suitable for them; and this itself would be unsuitable
   in any other, for it is in keeping with their character, while it
   mounts as far above that of others (not from empty inflation, but from
   solid merit) as it seems to fall below them. Where, however, I do not
   understand these writers, though their eloquence is then less apparent,
   I have no doubt but that it is of the same kind as that I do
   understand. The very obscurity, too, of these divine and wholesome
   words was a necessary element in eloquence of a kind that was designed
   to profit our understandings, not only by the discovery of truth. but
   also by the exercise of their powers.

   10. I could, however, if I had time, show those men who cry up their
   own form of language as superior to that of our authors (not because of
   its majesty, but because of its inflation), that all those powers and
   beauties of eloquence which they make their boast, are to be found in
   the sacred writings which God in His goodness has provided to mould our
   characters, and to guide us from this world of wickedness to the
   blessed world above. But it is not the qualities which these writers
   have in common with the heathen orators and poets that give me such
   unspeakable delight in their eloquence; I am more struck with
   admiration at the way in which, by an eloquence peculiarly their own,
   they so use this eloquence of ours that it is not conspicuous either by
   its presence or its absence: for it did not become them either to
   condemn it or to make an ostentatious display of it; and if they had
   shunned it, they would have done the former; if they had made it
   prominent, they might have appeared to be doing the latter. And in
   those passages where the learned do note its presence, the matters
   spoken of are such, that the words in which they are put seem not so
   much to be sought out by the speaker as spontaneously to suggest
   themselves; as if wisdom were walking out of its house,--that is, the
   breast of the wise man, and eloquence, like an inseparable attendant,
   followed it without being called for.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   11. For who would not see what the apostle meant to say, and how wisely
   he has said it, in the following passage: "We glory in tribulations
   also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience,
   experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because
   the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
   given unto us"? Now were any man unlearnedly learned (if I may use the
   expression) to contend that the apostle had here followed the rules of
   rhetoric, would not every Christian, learned or unlearned, laugh at
   him? And yet here we find the figure which is called in Greek "klimax"
   (climax,) and by some in Latin gradatio, for they do not care to call
   it scala (a ladder), when the words and ideas have a connection of
   dependency the one upon the other, as we see here that patience arises
   out of tribulation, experience out of patience, and hope out of
   experience. Another ornament, too, is found here; for after certain
   statements finished in a single tone of voice, which we call clauses
   and sections (membra et caesa), but the Greeks "koola" and "kommata",
   there follows a rounded sentence (ambitus sive circuitus ) which the
   Greeks call "periodos", the clauses of which are suspended on the voice
   of the speaker till the whole is completed by the last clause. For of
   the statements which precede the period; this is the first clause,
   "knowing that tribulation worketh patience;" the second, "and patience,
   experience;" the third, "and experience, hope." Then the period which
   is subjoined is completed in three clauses, of which the first is, "and
   hope maketh not ashamed;" the second, "because the love of God is shed
   abroad in our hearts;" the third, "by the Holy Ghost which is given
   unto us." But these and other matters of the same kind are taught in
   the art of elocution. As then I do not affirm that the apostle was
   guided by the rules of eloquence, so I do not deny that his wisdom
   naturally produced, and was accompanied by, eloquence.

   12. In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, again, he refutes certain
   false apostles who had gone out from the Jews, and had been trying to
   injure his character; and being compelled to speak of himself though he
   ascribes this as folly to himself how wisely and how eloquently he
   speaks! But wisdom is his guide, eloquence his attendant; he follows
   the first, the second follows him, and yet he does not spurn it when it
   comes after him. "I say again," he says, "Let no man think me a fool:
   if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a
   little. That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
   were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. Seeing that many glory
   after the flesh, I will glory also. For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing
   ye yourselves are wise. For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage,
   if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a
   man smite you on the face. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we
   had been weak. Howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold (I speak foolishly),
   I am bold also. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am
   I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are they ministers of Christ?
   (I speak as a fool), I am more: in labours more abundant, in stripes
   above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews
   five times received I forty stripes save one, thrice was I beaten with
   rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day
   I have been in the deep; in journeying often, in perils of waters, in
   perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the
   heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils
   in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and
   painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings
   often, in cold and nakedness. Besides those things which are without,
   that which comets upon me daily, the care of all the churches. Who is
   weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? If I must
   needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities."
   The thoughtful and attentive perceive how much wisdom there is in these
   words. And even a man sound asleep must notice what a stream of
   eloquence flows through them.

   13. Further still, the educated man observes that those sections which
   the Greeks call "kommata", and the clauses and periods of which I spoke
   a short time ago, being intermingled in the most beautiful variety,
   make up the whole form and features (so to speak) of that diction by
   which even the unlearned are delighted and affected. For, from the
   place where I commenced to quote, the passage consists of periods: the
   first the smallest possible, consisting of two members; for a period
   cannot have less than two members, though it may have more: "I say
   again, let no man think me a fool." The next has three members: "if
   otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
   The third has four members: "That which I speak, I speak it not after
   the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
   The fourth has two: "Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will
   glory also." And the fifth has two: "For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing
   ye yourselves are wise." The sixth again has two members: "for ye
   suffer, if a man bring you into bondage." Then follow three sections
   (caesa): "if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt
   himself." Next three clauses (membra): if "a man smite you on the face.
   I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak." Then is
   subjoined a period of three members: "Howbeit, whereinsoever any is
   bold (I speak foolishly), I am bold also." After this, certain separate
   sections being put in the interrogatory form, separate sections are
   also given as answers, three to three: "Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are
   they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I." But a
   fourth section being put likewise in the interrogatory form, the answer
   is given not in another section (caesum) but in a clause (membrum):
   "Are they the ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool.) I am more."
   Then the next four sections are given continuously, the interrogatory
   form being most elegantly suppressed: "in labours more abundant, in
   stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft." Next
   is interposed a short period; for, by a suspension of the voice, "of
   the Jews five times" is to be marked off as constituting one member, to
   which is joined the second, "received I forty stripes save one." Then
   he returns to sections, and three are set down: "Thrice was I beaten
   with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck." Next comes
   a clause: "a night and a day I have been in the deep." Next fourteen
   sections burst forth with a vehemence which is most appropriate: "In
   journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils
   by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the
   city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils
   among false brethren, in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often,
   in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness." After
   this comes in a period of three members: "Besides those things which
   are without, that which comets upon me daily, the care of all the
   churches." And to this he adds two clauses in a tone of inquiry: "Who
   is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?" In fine,
   this whole passage, as if panting for breath, winds up with a period of
   two members: "If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which
   concern mine infirmities." And I cannot sufficiently express how
   beautiful and delightful it is when after this outburst he rests
   himself, and gives the hearer rest, by interposing a slight narrative.
   For he goes on to say: "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not." And then he
   tells, very briefly the danger he had been in, and the way he escaped
   it.

   14. It would be tedious to pursue the matter further, or to point out
   the same facts in regard to other passages of Holy Scripture. Suppose I
   had taken the further trouble, at least in regard to the passages I
   have quoted from the apostle's writings, to point out figures of speech
   which are taught in the art of rhetoric? Is it not more likely that
   serious men would think I had gone too far, than that any of the
   studious would think I had done enough? All these things when taught by
   masters are reckoned of great value; great prices are paid for them,
   and the vendors puff them magniloquently. And I fear lest I too should
   smack of that puffery while thus descanting on matters of this kind. It
   was necessary, however, to reply to the ill-taught men who think our
   authors contemptible; not because they do not possess, but because they
   do not display, the eloquence which these men value so highly.

   15. But perhaps some one is thinking that I have selected the Apostle
   Paul because he is our great orator. For when he says, "Though I be
   rude in speech, yet not in knowledge," he seems to speak as if granting
   so much to his detractors, not as confessing that he recognized its
   truth. If he had said, "I am indeed rude in speech, but not in
   knowledge," we could not in any way have put another meaning upon it.
   He did not hesitate plainly to assert his knowledge, because without it
   he could not have been the teacher of the Gentiles. And certainly if we
   bring forward anything of his as a model of eloquence, we take it from
   those epistles which even his very detractors, who thought his bodily
   presence weak and his speech contemptible, confessed to be weighty and
   powerful.

   I see, then, that I must say something about the eloquence of the
   prophets also, where many things are concealed under a metaphorical
   style, which the more completely they seem buried under figures of
   speech, give the greater pleasure when brought to light. In this place,
   however, it is my duty to select a passage of such a kind that I shall
   not be compelled to explain the matter, but only to commend the style.
   And I shall do so, quoting principally from the book of that prophet
   who says that he was a shepherd or herdsman, and was called by God from
   that occupation, and sent to prophesy to the people of God. I shall
   not, however, follow the Septuagint translators, who, being themselves
   under the guidance of the Holy Spirit in their translation, seem to
   have altered some passages with the view of directing the reader's
   attention more particularly to the investigation of the spiritual
   sense; (and hence some passages are more obscure, because more
   figurative, in their translation;) but I shall follow the translation
   made from the Hebrew into Latin by the presbyter Jerome, a man
   thoroughly acquainted with both tongues.

   16. When, then, this rustic, or quondam rustic prophet, was denouncing
   the godless, the proud, the luxurious, and therefore the most
   neglectful of brotherly love, he called aloud, saying: "Woe to you who
   are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, who are
   heads and chiefs of the people, entering with pomp into the house of
   Israel! Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath
   the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines, and to all the best
   kingdoms of these: is their border greater than your border? Ye that
   are set apart for the day of evil, and that come near to the seat of
   oppression; that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch yourselves upon
   couches; that eat the lamb of the flock, and the calves out of the
   midst of the herd; that chant to the sound of the viol. They thought
   that they had instruments of music like David; drinking wine in bowls,
   and anointing themselves with the costliest ointment: and they were not
   grieved for the affliction of Joseph." Suppose those men who, assuming
   to be themselves learned and eloquent, despise our prophets as untaught
   and unskilful of speech, had been obliged to deliver a message like
   this, and to men such as these, would they have chosen to express
   themselves in any respect differently--those of them, at least, who
   would have shrunk from raving like madmen?

   17. For what is there that sober ears could wish changed in this
   speech? In the first place, the invective itself; with what vehemence
   it throws itself upon the drowsy senses to startle them into
   wakefulness: "Woe to you who are at ease in Zion, and trust in the
   mountains of Samaria, who are heads and chiefs of the people, entering
   with pomp into the house of Israel!" Next, that he may use the favours
   of God, who has bestowed upon them ample territory, to show their
   ingratitude in trusting to the mountain of Samaria, where idols were
   worshipped: "Pass ye unto Calneh," he says, "and see, and from thence
   go ye to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines, and
   to all the best kingdoms of these: is their border greater than your
   border?" At the same time also that these things are spoken of, the
   style is adorned with names of places as with lamps, such as "Zion,"
   "Samaria," "Calneh," "Hamath the great," and "Gath of the Philistine."
   Then the words joined to these places are most appropriately varied:
   "ye are at ease," "ye trust," "pass on," "go," "descend."

   18. And then the future captivity under an oppressive king is announced
   as approaching, when it is added: "Ye that are set apart for the day of
   evil, and come near to the seat of oppression." Then are subjoined the
   evils of luxury: "ye that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch
   yourselves upon couches; that eat the lamb from the flock, and the
   calves out of the midst of the herd." These six clauses form three
   periods of two members each. For he does not say: "Ye who are set apart
   for the day of evil, who come near to the seat of oppression, who sleep
   upon beds of ivory, who stretch yourselves upon couches, who eat the
   lamb from the flock, and calves out of the herd." If he had so
   expressed it, this would have had its beauty: six separate clauses
   running on, the same pronoun being repeated each time, and each clause
   finished by a single effort of the speaker's voice. But it is more
   beautiful as it is, the clauses being joined in pairs under the same
   pronoun, and forming three sentences, one referring to the prophecy of
   the captivity: "Ye that are set apart for the day of evil, and come
   near the seat of oppression;" the second to lasciviousness: "ye that
   lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch yourselves upon couches;" the third
   to gluttony: "who eat the lamb from the flock, and the calves out of
   the midst of the herd." So that it is at the discretion of the speaker
   whether he finish each clause separately and make six altogether, or
   whether he suspend his voice at the first, the third, and the fifth,
   and by joining the second to the first, the fourth to the third, and
   the sixth to the fifth, make three most elegant periods of two members
   each: one describing the imminent catastrophe; another, the lascivious
   couch; and the third, the luxurious table.

   19. Next he reproaches them with their luxury in seeking pleasure for
   the sense of hearing. And here, when he had said, "Ye who chant to the
   sound of the viol," seeing that wise men may practice music wisely, he,
   with wonderful skill of speech, checks the flow of his invective, and
   not now speaking to, but of, these men, and to show us that we must
   distinguish the music of the wise from the music of the voluptuary, he
   does not say, "Ye who chant to the sound of the viol, and think that ye
   have instruments of music like David;" but he first addresses to
   themselves what it is right the voluptuaries should hear, "Ye who chant
   to the sound of the viol;" and then, turning to others, he intimates
   that these men have not even skill in their art: "they thought that
   they had instruments of music like David; drinking wine in bowls, and
   anointing themselves with the costliest ointment." These three clauses
   are best pronounced when the voice is suspended on the first two
   members of the period, and comes to a pause on the third.

   20. But now as to the sentence which follows all these: "and they were
   not grieved for the affliction of Joseph." Whether this be pronounced
   continuously as one clause, or whether with more elegance we hold the
   words, "and they were not grieved," suspended on the voice, and then
   add, "for the affliction of Joseph," so as to make a period of two
   members; in any case, it is a touch of marvelous beauty not to say,
   "and they were not grieved for the affliction of their brother;" but to
   put Joseph for brother, so as to indicate brothers in general by the
   proper name of him who stands out illustrious from among his brethren,
   both in regard to the injuries he suffered and the good return he made.
   And, indeed, I do not know whether this figure of speech, by which
   Joseph is put for brothers in general, is one of those laid down in
   that art which I learnt and used to teach. But how beautiful it is, and
   how it comes home to the intelligent reader, it is useless to tell any
   one who does not himself feel it.

   21. And a number of other points bearing on the laws of eloquence could
   be found in this passage which I have chosen as an example. But an
   intelligent reader will not be so much instructed by carefully
   analysing it as kindled by reciting it with spirit. Nor was it composed
   by man's art and care, but it flowed forth in wisdom and eloquence from
   the divine mind; wisdom not aiming at eloquence, yet eloquence not
   shrinking from wisdom. For if, as certain very eloquent and acute men
   have perceived and said, the rules which are laid down in the art of
   oratory could not have been observed, and noted, and reduced to system,
   if they had not first had their birth in the genius of orators, is it
   wonderful that they should be found in the messengers of Him who is the
   author of all genius? Therefore let us acknowledge that the canonical
   writers are not only wise but eloquent also, with an eloquence suited
   to a character and position like theirs.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   22. But although I take some examples of eloquence from those writings
   of theirs which there is no difficulty in understanding, we are not by
   any means to suppose that it is our duty to imitate them in those
   passages where, with a view to exercise and train the minds of their
   readers, and to break in upon the satiety and stimulate the zeal of
   those who are willing to learn, and with a view also to throw a veil
   over the minds of the godless either that they may be converted to
   piety or shut out from a knowledge of the mysteries, from one or other
   of these reasons they have expressed themselves with a useful and
   wholesome obscurity. They have indeed expressed themselves in such a
   way that those who in after ages understood and explained them aright
   have in the Church of God obtained an esteem, not indeed equal to that
   with which they are themselves regarded, but coming next to it. The
   expositors of these writers, then, ought not to express themselves in
   the same way, as if putting forward their expositions as of the same
   authority; but they ought in all their deliverances to make it their
   first and chief aim to be understood, using as far as possible such
   clearness of speech that either he will be very dull who does not
   understand them, or that if what they say should not be very easily or
   quickly understood, the reason will lie not in their manner of
   expression, but in the difficulty and subtilty of the matter they are
   trying to explain.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   23. For there are some passages which are not understood in their
   proper force, or are understood with great difficulty, at whatever
   length, however clearly, or with whatever eloquence the speaker may
   expound them; and these should never be brought before the people at
   all, or only on rare occasions when there is some urgent reason. In
   books, however, which are written in such a style that, if understood,
   they, so to speak, draw their own readers, and if not understood, give
   no trouble to those who do not care to read them, and in private
   conversations, we must not shrink from the duty of bringing the truth
   which we ourselves have reached within the comprehension of others,
   however difficult it may be to understand it, and whatever labour in
   the way of argument it may cost us. Only two conditions are to be
   insisted upon, that our hearer or companion should have an earnest
   desire to learn the truth, and should have capacity of mind to receive
   it in whatever form it may be communicated, the teacher not being so
   anxious about the eloquence as about the clearness of his teaching.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   24. Now a strong desire for clearness sometimes leads to neglect of the
   more polished forms of speech, and indifference about what sounds well,
   compared with what dearly expresses and conveys the meaning intended.
   Whence a certain author, when dealing with speech of this kind, says
   that there is in it "a kind of careful negligence." Yet while taking
   away ornament, it does not bring in vulgarity of speech; though good
   teachers have, or ought to have, so great an anxiety about teaching
   that they will employ a word which cannot be made pure Latin without
   becoming obscure or ambiguous, but which when used according to the
   vulgar idiom is neither ambiguous nor obscure) not in the way the
   learned, but rather in the way the unlearned employ it. For if our
   translators did not shrink from saying, "Non congregabo conventicula
   eorum de sanguinibus" (I shall not assemble their assemblies of blood),
   because they felt that it was important for the sense to put a word
   here in the plural which in Latin is only used in the singular; why
   should a teacher of godliness who is addressing an unlearned audience
   shrink from using "ossum"; instead of "os", if he fear that the latter
   might be taken not as the singular of "ossa", but as the singular of
   "ora", seeing that African ears have no quick perception of the
   shortness or length of vowels? And what advantage is there in purity of
   speech which does not lead to understanding in the hearer, seeing that
   there is no use at all in speaking, if they do not understand us for
   whose sake we speak? He, therefore, who teaches will avoid all words
   that do not teach; and if instead of them he can find words which are
   at once pure and intelligible, he will take these by preference; if,
   however, he cannot, either because there are no such words, or because
   they do not at the time occur to him, he will use words that are not
   quite pure, if only the substance of his thought be conveyed and
   apprehended in its integrity.

   25. And this must be insisted on as necessary to our being understood,
   not only in conversations, whether with one person or with several, but
   much more in the case of a speech delivered in public: for in
   conversation any one has the power of asking a question; but when all
   are silent that one may be heard, and all faces are turned attentively
   upon him, it is neither customary nor decorous for a person to ask a
   question about what he does not understand; and on this account the
   speaker ought to be especially careful to give assistance to those who
   cannot ask it. Now a crowd anxious for instruction generally shows by
   its movements if it understands what is said; and until some indication
   of this sort be given, the subject discussed ought to be turned over
   and over, and put in every shape and form and variety of expression, a
   thing which cannot be done by men who are repeating words prepared
   beforehand and committed to memory. As soon, however, as the speaker
   has ascertained that what he says is understood, he ought either to
   bring his address to a close, or pass on to another point. For if a man
   gives pleasure when he throws light upon points on which people wish
   for instruction, he becomes wearisome when he dwells at length upon
   things that are already well known, especially when men's expectation
   was fixed on having the difficulties of the passage removed. For even
   things that are very well known are told for the sake of the pleasure
   they give, if the attention be directed not to the things themselves,
   but to the way in which they are told. Nay, even when the style itself
   is already well known, if it be pleasing to the hearers, it is almost a
   matter of indifference whether he who speaks be a speaker or a reader.
   For things that are gracefully written are often not only read with
   delight by those who are making their first acquaintance with them, but
   reread with delight by those who have already made acquaintance with
   them, and have not yet forgotten them; nay, both these classes will
   derive pleasure even from hearing another man repeat them. And if a man
   has forgotten anything, when he is reminded of it he is taught. But I
   am not now treating of the mode of giving pleasure. I am speaking of
   the mode in which men who desire to learn ought to be taught. And the
   best mode is that which secures that he who hears shall hear the truth,
   and that what he hears he shall understand. And when this point has
   been reached, no further labour need be spent on the truth itself, as
   if it required further explanation; but perhaps some trouble may be
   taken to enforce it so as to bring it home to the heart. If it appear
   right to do this, it ought to be done so moderately as not to lead to
   weariness and impatience.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   26. For teaching, of course, true eloquence consists, not in making
   people like what they disliked, nor in making them do what they shrank
   from, but in making clear what was obscure; yet if this be done without
   grace of style, the benefit does not extend beyond the few eager
   students who are anxious to know whatever is to be learnt, however rude
   and unpolished the form in which it is put, and who, when they have
   succeeded in their object, find the plain truth pleasant food enough.
   And it is one of the distinctive features of good intellects not to
   love words, but the truth in words. For of what service is a golden
   key, if it cannot open what we want it to open? Or what objection is
   there to a wooden one if it can, seeing that to open what is shut is
   all we want? But as there is a certain analogy between learning and
   eating, the very food without which it is impossible to live must be
   flavoured to meet the tastes of the majority.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   27. Accordingly a great orator has truly said that "an eloquent man
   must speak so as to teach, to delight, and to persuade." Then he adds:
   "To teach is a necessity, to delight is a beauty, to persuade is a
   triumph." Now of these three, the one first mentioned, the teaching,
   which is a matter of necessity, depends on what we say; the other two
   on the way we say it. He, then, who speaks with the purpose of teaching
   should not suppose that he has said what he has to say as long as he is
   not understood; for although what he has said be intelligible to
   himself, it is not said at all to the man who does not understand it.
   If, however, he is understood, he has said his say, whatever may have
   been his manner of saying it. But if he wishes to delight or persuade
   his hearer as well, he will not accomplish that end by putting his
   thought in any shape no matter what, but for that purpose the style of
   speaking is a matter of importance. And as the hearer must be pleased
   in order to secure his attention, so he must be persuaded in order to
   move him to action. And as he is pleased if you speak with sweetness
   and elegance, so he is persuaded if he be drawn by your promises, and
   awed by your threats; If he reject what you condemn, and embrace what
   you commend; if he grieve when you heap up objects for grief, and
   rejoice when you point out an object for joy; if he pity those whom you
   present to him as objects of pity, and shrink from those whom you set
   before him as men to be feared and shunned. I need not go over all the
   other things that can be done by powerful eloquence to move the minds
   of the hearers, not telling them what they ought to do, but urging them
   to do what they already know ought to be done.

   28. If however, they do not yet know this, they must of course be
   instructed before they can be moved. And perhaps the mere knowledge of
   their duty will have such an effect that there will be no need to move
   them with greater strength of eloquence. Yet when this is needful, it
   ought to be done. And it is needful when people, knowing what they
   ought to do, do it not. Therefore, to teach is a necessity. For what
   men know, it is in their own hands either to do or not to do. But who
   would say that it is their duty to do what they do not know? On the
   same principle, to persuade is not a necessity: for it is not always
   called for; as, for example, when the hearer yields his assent to one
   who simply teaches or gives pleasure. For this reason also to persuade
   is a triumph, because it is possible that a man may be taught and
   delighted, and yet not give his consent. And what will be the use of
   gaining the first two ends if we fail in the third? Neither is it a
   necessity to give pleasure; for when, in the course of an address, the
   truth is clearly pointed out (and this is the true function of
   teaching), it is not the fact, nor is it the intention, that the style
   of speech should make the truth pleasing, or that the style should of
   itself give pleasure; but the truth itself, when exhibited in its naked
   simplicity, gives pleasure, because it is the truth. And hence even
   falsities are frequently a source of pleasure when they are brought to
   light and exposed. It is not, of course, their falsity that gives
   pleasure; but as it is true that they are false, the speech which shows
   this to be true gives pleasure.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   29. But for the sake at those who are so fastidious that they do not
   care for truth unless it is put in the form of a pleasing discourse, no
   small place has been assigned in eloquence to the art of pleasing. And
   yet even this is not enough for those stubborn minded men who both
   understand and are pleased with the teacher's discourse, without
   deriving any profit from it. For what does it profit a man that he both
   confesses the truth and praises the eloquence, if he does not yield his
   consent, when it is only for the sake of securing his consent that the
   speaker in urging the truth gives careful attention to what he says? If
   the truths taught are such that to believe or to know them is enough,
   to give one's assent implies nothing more than to confess that they are
   true. When, however, the truth taught is one that must be carried into
   practice, and that is taught for the very purpose of being practiced,
   it is useless to be persuaded of the truth of what is said, it is
   useless to be pleased with the manner in which it is said, if it be not
   so learnt as to be practiced. The eloquent divine, then, when he is
   urging a practical truth, must not only teach so as to give
   instruction, and please so as to keep up the attention, but he must
   also sway the mind so as to subdue the will. For if a man be not moved
   by the force of truth, though it is demonstrated to his own confession,
   and clothed in beauty of style, nothing remains but to subdue him by
   the power of eloquence.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   30. And so much labour has been spent by men on the beauty of
   expression here spoken of, that not only is it not our duty to do, but
   it is our duty to shun and abhor, many and heinous deeds of wickedness
   and baseness which wicked and base men have with great eloquence
   recommended, not with a view to gaining assent, but merely for the sake
   of being read with pleasure. But may God avert from His Church what the
   prophet Jeremiah says of the synagogue of the Jews: "A wonderful and
   horrible thing is committed in the land: the prophets prophesy falsely,
   and the priests applaud them with their hands; and my people love to
   have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?" O eloquence, which
   is the more terrible from its purity, and the more crushing from its
   solidity! Assuredly it is "a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces."
   For to this God Himself has by the same prophet compared His own word
   spoken through His holy prophets. God forbid, then, God forbid that
   with us the priest should applaud the false prophet, and that God's
   people should love to have it so. God forbid, I say, that with us there
   should be such terrible madness! For what shall we do in the end
   thereof? And assuredly it is preferable, even though what is said
   should be less intelligible, less pleasing, and less persuasive, that
   truth be spoken, and that what is just, not what is iniquitous, be
   listened to with pleasure. But this, of course, cannot be, unless what
   is true and just be expressed with elegance.

   31. In a serious assembly, moreover, such as is spoken of when it is
   said, "I will praise Thee among much people," no pleasure is derived
   from that species of eloquence which indeed says nothing that is false,
   but which buries small and unimportant truths under a frothy mass of
   ornamental words, such as would not be graceful or dignified even if
   used to adorn great and fundamental truths. And something of this sort
   occurs in a letter of the blessed Cyprian, which, I think, came there
   by accident, or else was inserted designedly with this view, that
   posterity might see how the wholesome discipline of Christian teaching
   had cured him of that redundancy of language, and confined him to a
   more dignified and modest form of eloquence, such as we find in his
   subsequent letters, a style which is admired without effort, is sought
   after with eagerness, but is not attained without great difficulty. He
   says, then, in one place, "Let us seek this abode: the neighbouring
   solitudes afford a retreat where, whilst the spreading shoots of the
   vine trees, pendulous and intertwined, creep amongst the supporting
   reeds, the leafy covering has made a portico of vine." There is
   wonderful fluency and exuberance of language here; but it is too florid
   to be pleasing to serious minds. But people who are fond of this style
   are apt to think that men who do not use it, but employ a more
   chastened style, do so because they cannot attain the former, not
   because their judgment teaches them to avoid it. Wherefore this holy
   man shows both that he can speak in that style. for he has done so
   once, and that he does not choose, for he never uses it again.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   32. And so our Christian orator, while he says what is just, and holy,
   and good (and he ought never to say anything else), does all he can to
   be heard with intelligence, with pleasure, and with obedience; and he
   need not doubt that if he succeed in this object, and so far as he
   succeeds, he will succeed more by piety in prayer than by gifts of
   oratory; and so he ought to pray for himself, and for those he is about
   to address, before he attempts to speak. And when the hour is come that
   he must speak, he ought, before he opens his mouth, to lift up his
   thirsty soul to God, to drink in what he is about to pour forth, and to
   be himself filled with what he is about to distribute. For, as in
   regard to every matter of faith and love there are many things that may
   be said, and many ways of saying them, who knows what it is expedient
   at a given moment for us to say, or to be heard saying, except God who
   knows the hearts of all? And who can make us say what we ought, and in
   the way we ought, except Him in whose hand both we and our speeches
   are? Accordingly, he who is anxious both to know and to teach should
   learn all that is to be taught, and acquire such a faculty of speech as
   is suitable for a divine. But when the hour for speech arrives, let him
   reflect upon that saying of our Lord's, as better suited to the wants
   of a pious mind: "Take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it
   shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not
   ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you."
   The Holy Spirit, then, speaks thus in those who for Christ's sake are
   delivered to the persecutors; why not also in those who deliver
   Christ's message to those who are willing to learn?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   33. Now if any one says that we need not direct men how or what they
   should teach, since the Holy Spirit makes them teachers, he may as well
   say that we need not pray, since our Lord says, "Your Father knoweth
   what things ye have need of before ye ask Him;" or that the Apostle
   Paul should not have given directions to Timothy and Titus as to how or
   what they should teach others. And these three apostolic epistles ought
   to be constantly before the eyes of every one who has obtained the
   position of a teacher in the Church. In the First Epistle to Timothy do
   we not read: "These things command and teach?" What these things are,
   has been told previously. Do we not read there: "Rebuke not an elder,
   but entreat him as a father?" Is it not said in the Second Epistle:
   "Hold fast the form of sound words,; which thou hast heard of me?" And
   is he not there told: "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a
   workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
   truth?" And in the same place: "Preach the word; be instant in season,
   out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and
   doctrine." And so in the Epistle to Titus, does he not say that a
   bishop ought to "hold fast the faithful word as he has been taught,
   that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
   the gainsayers?" There, too, he says: "But speak thou the things which
   become sound doctrine: that the aged men be sober," and so on. And
   there, too: "These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all
   authority. Let no man despise thee. Put them in mind to be subject to
   principalities and powers," and so on. What then are we to think? Does
   the apostle in any way contradict himself, when, though he says that
   men are made teachers by the operation of the Holy Spirit, he yet
   himself gives them directions how and what they should teach? Or are we
   to understand, that though the duty of men to teach even the teachers
   does not cease when the Holy Spirit is given, yet that neither is he
   who planteth anything, nor he who watereth, but God who giveth the
   increase? Wherefore though holy men be our helpers, or even holy angels
   assist us, no one learns aright the things that pertain to life with
   God, until God makes him ready to learn from Himself, that God who is
   thus addressed in the psalm: "Teach me to do Thy will; for Thou art my
   God." And so the same apostle says to Timothy himself, speaking, of
   course, as teacher to disciple: "But continue thou in the things which
   thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast
   learned them." For as the medicines which men apply to the bodies of
   their fellow-men are of no avail except God gives them virtue (who can
   heal without their aid, though they cannot without His), and yet they
   are applied; and if it be done from a sense of duty, it is esteemed a
   work of mercy or benevolence; so the aids of teaching, applied through
   the instrumentality of man, are of advantage to the soul only when God
   works to make them of advantage, who could give the gospel to man even
   without the help or agency of men.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   34. He then who, in speaking, aims at enforcing what is good, should
   not despise any of those three objects, either to teach, or to give
   pleasure, or to move, and should pray and strive, as we have said
   above, to be heard with intelligence, with pleasure, and with ready
   compliance. And when he does this with elegance and propriety, he may
   justly be called eloquent, even though he do not carry with him the
   assent of his hearer. For it is these three ends, viz., teaching,
   giving pleasure, and moving, that the great master of Roman eloquence
   himself seems to have intended that the following three directions
   should subserve: "He, then, shall be eloquent, who can say little
   things in a subdued style, moderate things in a temperate style, and
   great things in a majestic style:" as if he had taken in also the three
   ends mentioned above, and had embraced the whole in one sentence thus:
   "He, then, shall be eloquent, who can say little things in a subdued
   style, in order to give instruction, moderate things in a temperate
   style, in order to give pleasure, and great things in a majestic style,
   in order to sway the mind."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 18

   35. Now the author I have quoted could have exemplified these three
   directions, as laid down by himself, in regard to legal questions: he
   could not, however, have done so in regard to ecclesiastical
   questions,--the only ones that an address such as I wish to give shape
   to is concerned with. For of legal questions those are called small
   which have reference to pecuniary transactions; those great where a
   matter relating to man's life or liberty comes up. Cases, again, which
   have to do with neither of these, and where the intention is not to get
   the hearer to do, or to pronounce judgment upon anything, but only to
   give him pleasure, occupy as it were a middle place between the former
   two, and are on that account called middling, or moderate. For moderate
   things get their name from modus (a measure); and it is an abuse, not a
   proper use of the word moderate, to put it for little. In questions
   like ours, however, where all things, and especially those addressed to
   the people from the place of authority, ought to have reference to
   men's salvation, and that not their temporal but their eternal
   salvation, and where also the thing to be guarded against is eternal
   ruin, everything that we say is important; so much so, that even what
   the preacher says about pecuniary matters, whether it have reference to
   loss or gain, whether the amount be great or small, should not seem
   unimportant. For justice is never unimportant, and justice ought
   assuredly to be observed, even in small affairs of money, as our Lord
   says: "He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in
   much." That which is least, then, is very little; but to be faithful in
   that which is least is great. For as the nature of the circle, viz.,
   that all lines drawn from the centre to the circumference are equal, is
   the same in a great disk that it is in the smallest coin; so the
   greatness of justice is in no degree lessened, though the matters to
   which justice is applied be small.

   36. And when the apostle spoke about trials in regard to secular
   affairs (and what were these but matters of money?), he says: "Dare any
   of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust,
   and not before the saints? Do ye not know that the saints shall judge
   the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to
   judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? How
   much more things that pertain to this life? If, then, ye have judgments
   of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least
   esteemed in the Church. I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is
   not a wise man among you? No, not one that shall be able to judge
   between his brethren? But brother goes to law with brother, and that
   before the unbelievers. Now therefore there is utterly a fault among
   you, because ye go to law one with another: why do ye not rather take
   wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, ye
   do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the
   unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" Why is it that the
   apostle is so indignant, and that he thus accuses, and upbraids, and
   chides, and threatens? Why is it that the changes in his tone, so
   frequent and so abrupt, testify to the depth of his emotion? Why is it,
   in fine, that he speaks in a tone so exalted about matters so very
   trifling? Did secular matters deserve so much at his hands? God forbid.
   No; but all this is done for the sake of justice, charity, and piety,
   which in the judgment of every sober mind are great, even when applied
   to matters the very least.

   37. Of course, if we were giving men advice as to how they ought to
   conduct secular cases, either for themselves or for their connections,
   before the church courts, we would rightly advise them to conduct them
   quietly as matters of little moment. But we are treating of the manner
   of speech of the man who is to be a teacher of the truths which deliver
   us from eternal misery and bring us to eternal happiness; and wherever
   these truths are spoken of, whether in public or private, whether to
   one or many, whether to friends or enemies, whether in a continuous
   discourse or in conversation, whether in tracts, or in books, or in
   letters long or short, they are of great importance. Unless indeed we
   are prepared to say that, because a cup of cold water is a very
   trifling and common thing, the saying of our Lord that he who gives a
   cup of cold water to one of His disciples shall in no wise lose his
   reward, is very trivial and unimportant. Or that when a preacher takes
   this saying as his text, he should think his subject very unimportant,
   and therefore speak without either eloquence or power, but in a subdued
   and humble style. Is it not the case that when we happen to speak on
   this subject to the people, and the presence of God is with us, so that
   what we say is not altogether unworthy of the subject, a tongue of fire
   springs up out of that cold water which inflames even the cold hearts
   of men with a zeal for doing works of mercy in hope of an eternal
   reward?

   38. And yet, while our teacher ought to speak of great matters, he
   ought not always to be speaking of them in a majestic tone, but in a
   subdued tone when he is teaching, temperately when he is giving praise
   or blame. When, however, something is to be done, and we are speaking
   to those who ought, but are not willing, to do it, then great matters
   must be spoken of with power, and in a manner calculated to sway the
   mind. And sometimes the same important matter is treated in all these
   ways at different times, quietly when it is being taught, temperately
   when its importance is being urged, and powerfully when we are forcing
   a mind that is averse to the truth to turn and embrace it. For is there
   anything greater than God Himself? Is nothing, then, to be learnt about
   Him? Or ought he who is teaching the Trinity in unity to speak of it
   otherwise than in the method of calm discussion, so that in regard to a
   subject which it is not easy to comprehend, we may understand as much
   as it is given us to understand? Are we in this case to seek out
   ornaments instead of proofs? Or is the hearer to be moved to do
   something instead of being instructed so that he may learn something?
   But when we come to praise God, either in Himself, or in His works,
   what a field for beauty and splendour of language opens up before man,
   who can task his powers to the utmost in praising Him whom no one can
   adequately praise, though there is no one who does not praise Him in
   some measure! But if He be not worshipped, or if idols, whether they be
   demons or any created being whatever, be worshipped with Him or in
   preference to Him, then we ought to speak out with power and
   impressiveness, show how great a wickedness this is, and urge men to
   flee from it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 20

   39. But now to come to something more definite. We have an example of
   the calm, subdued style in the Apostle Paul, where he says: "Tell me,
   ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is
   written, that Abraham had two sons; the one by a bond maid, the other
   by a free woman. But he who was of the bond woman was born after the
   flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise. Which things are an
   allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the Mount
   Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Hagar. For this Hagar is
   Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is
   in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free,
   which is the mother of us all;" and so on. And in the same way where he
   reasons thus: "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be
   but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or
   addeth thereto. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He
   saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
   which is Christ. And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed
   before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
   years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none
   effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
   but God gave it to Abraham by promise." And because it might possibly
   occur to the hearer to ask, If there is no inheritance by the law, why
   then was the law given? he himself anticipates this objection and asks,
   "Wherefore then serveth the law?" And the answer is given: "It was
   added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the
   promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a
   mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one." And
   here an objection occurs which he himself has stated: "Is the law then
   against the promises of God?" He answers: "God forbid." And he also
   states the reason in these words: "For if there had been a law given
   which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by
   the law. But the Scripture has concluded all under sin, that the
   promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
   It is part, then, of the duty of the teacher not only to interpret what
   is obscure, and to unravel the difficulties of questions, but also,
   while doing this, to meet other questions which may chance to suggest
   themselves, lest these should cast doubt or discredit on what we say.
   If, however, the solution of these questions suggest itself as soon as
   the questions themselves arise, it is useless to disturb what we cannot
   remove. And besides, when out of one question other questions arise,
   and out of these again still others; if these be all discussed and
   solved, the reasoning is extended to such a length, that unless the
   memory be exceedingly powerful and active, the reasoner finds it
   impossible to return to the original question from which he set out. It
   is, however, exceedingly desirable that whatever occurs to the mind as
   an objection that might be urged should be stated and refuted, lest it
   turn up at a time when no one will be present to answer it, or lest, if
   it should occur to a man who is present but says nothing about it, it
   might never be thoroughly removed.

   40. In the following words of the apostle we have the temperate style:
   "Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men
   as brethren; the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters." And
   also in these: "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
   God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
   unto God, which is your reasonable service." And almost the whole of
   this hortatory passage is in the temperate style of eloquence; and
   those parts of it are the most beautiful in which, as if paying what
   was due, things that belong to each other are gracefully brought
   together. For example: "Having then gifts, differing according to the
   grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according
   to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our
   ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on
   exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that
   ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let
   love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that
   which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly
   love; in honour preferring one another; not slothful in business;
   fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope; patient in
   tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; distributing to the
   necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute
   you: bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep
   with them that weep. Be of the same mind one towards another." And how
   gracefully all this is brought to a close in a period of two members:
   "Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate!" And a
   little afterwards: "Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom
   tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to
   whom honour." And these also, though expressed in single clauses, are
   terminated by a period of two members: "Owe no man anything, but to
   love one another." And a little farther on: "The night is far spent,
   the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,
   and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the
   day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness,
   not in strife and envying: but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof." Now if
   the passage were translated thus, "et carnis prividentiam ne in
   concupiscentiis feceritis", the ear would no doubt be gratified with a
   more harmonious ending; but our translator, with more strictness,
   preferred to retain even the order of the words. And how this sounds in
   the Greek language, in which the apostle spoke, those who are better
   skilled in that tongue may determine. My opinion, however, is, that
   what has been translated to us in the same order of words does not run
   very harmoniously even in the original tongue.

   41. And, indeed, I must confess that our authors are very defective in
   that grace of speech which consists in harmonious endings. Whether this
   be the fault of the translators, or whether, as I am more inclined to
   believe, the authors designedly avoided such ornaments, I dare not
   affirm; for I confess I do not know. This I know, however, that if any
   one who is skilled in this species of harmony would take the closing
   sentences of these writers and arrange them according to the law of
   harmony (which he could very easily do by changing some words for words
   of equivalent meaning, or by retaining the words he finds and altering
   their arrangement), he will learn that these divinely-inspired men are
   not defective in any of those points which he has been taught in the
   schools of the grammarians and rhetoricians to consider of importance;
   and he will find in them many kinds of speech of great beauty,
   beautiful even in our language, but especially beautiful in the
   original,--none of which canoe found in those writings of which they
   boast so much. But care must be taken that, while adding harmony, we
   take away none of the weight from these divine and authoritative
   utterances. Now our prophets were so far from being deficient in the
   musical training from which this harmony we speak of is most fully
   learnt, that Jerome, a very learned man, describes even the metres
   employed by some of them, in the Hebrew language at least; though, in
   order to give an accurate rendering of the words, he has not preserved
   these in his translation. I, however (to speak of my own feeling, which
   is better known to me than it is to others, and than that of others is
   to me), while I do not in my own speech, however modestly I think it
   done, neglect these harmonious endings, am just as well pleased to find
   them in the sacred authors very rarely.

   42. The majestic style of speech differs from the temperate style just
   spoken of, chiefly in that it is not so much decked out with verbal
   ornaments as exalted into vehemence by mental emotion. It uses, indeed,
   nearly all the ornaments that the other does; but if they do not happen
   to be at hand, it does not seek for them. For it is borne on by its own
   vehemence; and the force of the thought, not the desire for ornament,
   makes it seize upon any beauty of expression that comes in its way. It
   is enough for its object that warmth of feeling should suggest the
   fitting words; they need not be selected by careful elaboration of
   speech. If a brave man be armed with weapons adorned with gold and
   jewels, he works feats of valor with those arms in the heat of battle,
   not because they are costly, but because they are arms; and yet the
   same man does great execution, even when anger furnishes him with a
   weapon that he digs out of the ground. The apostle in the following
   passage is urging that, for the sake of the ministry of the gospel, and
   sustained by the consolations of God's grace, we should bear with
   patience all the evils of this life. It is a great subject, and is
   treated with power, and the ornaments of speech are not wanting:
   "Behold," he says, "now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of
   salvation. Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry be not
   blamed: but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
   in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in
   strifes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in
   fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by
   the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power
   of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the
   left, by honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
   deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and,
   behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway
   rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet
   possessing all things." See him still burning: "O ye Corinthians, our
   mouth is opened unto you, our heart is enlarged," and so on; it would
   be tedious to go through it all.

   43. And in the same way, writing to the Romans, he urges that the
   persecutions of this world should be overcome by charity, in assured
   reliance on the help of God. And he treats this subject with both power
   and beauty: "We know," he says, "that all things work together for good
   to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His
   purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
   many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called;
   and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them
   He also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be
   for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but
   delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give
   us all things? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It
   is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that
   died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand
   of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from
   the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
   famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written, For Thy
   sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the
   slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors,
   through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor
   life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
   nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,
   shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
   Jesus our Lord."

   44. Again, in writing to the Galatians, although the whole epistle is
   written in the subdued style, except at the end, where it rises into a
   temperate eloquence, yet he interposes one passage of so much feeling
   that, not withstanding the absence of any ornaments such as appear in
   the passages just quoted, it cannot be called anything but powerful:
   "Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid of you,
   lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. Brethren, I beseech you,
   be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all. Ye know
   how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel unto you at
   the first. And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
   rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
   Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? For I bear you record, that,
   if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and
   have given them to me. Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell
   you the truth? They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would
   exclude you, that ye might affect them. But it is good to be zealously
   affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am preset with
   you. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
   be formed in you, I desire to be present with you now, and to change my
   voice; for I stand in doubt of you". Is there anything here of
   contrasted words arranged antithetically, or of words rising gradually
   to a climax, or of sonorous clauses, and sections, and periods? Yet,
   notwithstanding, there is a glow of strong emotion that makes us feel
   the fervour of eloquence.

  Chapter 21

   45. But these writings of the apostles, though clear, are yet profound,
   and are so written that one who is not content with a superficial
   acquaintance, but desires to know them thoroughly, must not only read
   and hear them, but must have an expositor. Let us, then, study these
   various modes of speech as they are exemplified in the writings of men
   who, by reading the Scriptures, have attained to the knowledge of
   divine and saving truth, and have ministered it to the Church. Cyprian
   of blessed memory writes in the subdued style in his treatise on the
   sacrament of the cup. In this book he resolves the question, whether
   the cup of the Lord ought to contain water only, or water mingled with
   wine. But we must quote a passage by way of illustration. After the
   customary introduction, he proceeds to the discussion of the point in
   question. "Observe," he says, "that we are instructed, in presenting
   the cup, to maintain the custom handed down to us from the Lord, and to
   do nothing that our Lord has not first done for us: so that the cup
   which is offered in remembrance of Him should be mixed with wine. For,
   as Christ says, 'I am the true vine,' it follows that the blood of
   Christ is wine, not water; and the cup cannot appear to contain His
   blood by which we are redeemed and quickened, if the wine be absent;
   for by the wine is the blood of Christ typified, that blood which is
   foreshadowed and proclaimed in all the types and declarations of
   Scripture. For we find that in the book of Genesis this very
   circumstance in regard to the sacrament is foreshadowed, and our Lord's
   sufferings typically set forth, in the case of Noah, when he drank
   wine, and was drunken, and was uncovered within his tent, and his
   nakedness was exposed by his second son, and was carefully hidden by
   his elder and his younger sons. It is not necessary to mention the
   other circumstances in detail, as it is only necessary to observe this
   point, that Noah, foreshadowing the future reality, drank, not water,
   but wine, and thus showed forth our Lord's passion. In the same way we
   see the sacrament of the Lord's supper prefigured in the case of
   Melchizedek the priest, according to the testimony of the Holy
   Scriptures, where it says: 'And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth
   bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he
   blessed Abraham.' Now, that Melchizedek was a type of Christ, the Holy
   Spirit declares in the Psalms, where the Father addressing the Son
   says, 'Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.'" In
   this passage, and in all of the letter that follows, the subdued style
   is maintained, as the reader may easily satisfy himself.

   46. St. Ambrose also, though dealing with a question of very great
   importance, the equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the
   Son, employs the subdued style, because the object he has in view
   demands, not beauty of diction, nor the swaying of the mind by the stir
   of emotion, but facts and proofs. Accordingly, in the introduction to
   his work, we find the following passage among others: "When Gideon was
   startled by the message he had heard from God, that, though thousands
   of the people failed, yet through one man God would deliver His people
   from their enemies, he brought forth a kid of the goats, and by
   direction of the angel laid it with unleavened cakes upon a rock, and
   poured the broth over it; and as soon as the angel of God touched it
   with the end of the staff that was in his hand, there rose up fire out
   of the rock and consumed the offering. Now this sign seems to indicate
   that the rock was a type of the body of Christ, for it is written,
   'They drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock
   was Christ;' this, of course, referring not to Christ's divine nature,
   but to His flesh, whose ever-flowing fountain of blood has ever
   satisfied the hearts of His thirsting people. And so it was at that
   time declared in a mystery that the Lord Jesus, when crucified, should
   abolish in His flesh the sins of the whole world, and not their guilty
   acts merely, but the evil lusts of their hearts. For the kid's flesh
   refers to the guilt of the outward act, the broth to the allurement of
   lust within, as it is written, 'And the mixed multitude that was among
   them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept again and
   said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?' When the angel, then, stretched
   out his staff and touched the rock, and fire rose out of it, this was a
   sign that our Lord's flesh, filled with the Spirit of God, should burn
   up all the sins of the human race. Whence also the Lord says, 'I am
   come to send fire on the earth.'" And in the same style he pursues the
   subject, devoting himself chiefly to proving and enforcing his point.

   47. An example of the temperate style is the celebrated encomium on
   virginity from Cyprian: "Now our discourse addresses itself to the
   virgins, who, as they are the objects of higher honour, are also the
   objects of greater care. These are the flowers on the tree of the
   Church, the glory and ornament of spiritual grace, the joy of honour
   and praise, a work unbroken and unblemished, the image of God answering
   to the holiness of the Lord, the brighter portion of the flock of
   Christ. The glorious fruitfulness of their mother the Church rejoices
   in them, and in them flourishes more abundantly; and in proportion as
   bright virginity adds to her numbers, in the same proportion does the
   mother's joy increase." And at another place in the end of the epistle,
   "As we have borne," he says, "the image of the earthly, we shall also
   bear the image of the heavenly." Virginity bears this image, integrity
   bears it, holiness and truth bear it; they bear it who are mindful of
   the chastening of the Lord, who observe justice and piety, who are
   strong in faith, humble in fear, steadfast in the endurance of
   suffering, meek in the endurance of injury, ready to pity, of one mind
   and of one heart in brotherly peace. And every one of these things
   ought ye, holy virgins, to obscene, to cherish, and fulfill, who having
   hearts at leisure for God and for Christ, and having chosen the greater
   and better part, lead and point the way to the Lord, to whom you have
   pledged your vows. Ye who are advanced in age, exercise control over
   the younger. Ye who are younger, wait upon the elders, and encourage
   your equals; stir up one another by mutual exhortations; provoke one
   another to glory by emulous examples of virtue; endure bravely, advance
   in spirituality, finish your course with joy; only be mindful of us
   when your virginity shall begin to reap its reward of honour."

   48. Ambrose also uses the temperate and ornamented style when he is
   holding up before virgins who have made their profession a model for
   their imitation, and says: "She was a virgin not in body only, but also
   in mind; not mingling the purity of her affection with any dross of
   hypocrisy; serious in speech; prudent in disposition; sparing of words;
   delighting in study; not placing her confidence in uncertain riches,
   but in the prayer of the poor; diligent in labour; reverent in word;
   accustomed to look to God, not man, as the guide of her conscience;
   injuring no one, wishing well to all; dutiful to her elders, not
   envious of her equals; avoiding boastfulness, following reason, loving
   virtue. When did she wound her parents even by a look? When did she
   quarrel with her neighbours? When did she spurn the humble, laugh at
   the weak, or shun the indigent? She is accustomed to visit only those
   haunts of men that pity would not blush for, nor modesty pass by. There
   is nothing haughty in her eyes, nothing bold in her words, nothing
   wanton in her gestures: her bearing is not voluptuous, nor her gait too
   free, nor her voice petulant; so that her outward appearance is an
   image of her mind, and a picture of purity. For a good house ought to
   be known for such at the very threshold, and show at the very entrance
   that there is no dark recess within, as the light of a lamp set inside
   sheds its radiance on the outside. Why need I detail her sparingness in
   food, her superabundance in duty,--the one falling beneath the demands
   of nature, the other rising above its powers? The latter has no
   intervals of intermission, the former doubles the days by fasting; and
   when the desire for refreshment does arise, it is satisfied with food
   such as will support life, but not minister to appetite." Now I have
   cited these latter passages as examples of the temperate style, because
   their purpose is not to induce those who have not yet devoted
   themselves to take the vows of virginity, but to show of what character
   those who have taken vows ought to be. To prevail on any one to take a
   step of such a nature and of so great importance, requires that the
   mind should be excited and set on fire by the majestic style. Cyprian
   the martyr, however, did not write about the duty of taking up the
   profession of virginity, but about the dress and deportment of virgins.
   Yet that great bishop urges them to their duty even in these respects
   by the power of a majestic eloquence.

   49. But I shall select examples of the majestic style from their
   treatment of a subject which both of them have touched. Both have
   denounced the women who colour, or rather discolour, their faces with
   paint. And the first, in dealing with this topic, says: "Suppose a
   painter should depict in colours that rival nature's the features and
   form and completion of some man, and that, when the portrait had been
   finished with consummate art, another painter should put his hand over
   it, as if to improve by his superior skill the painting already
   completed; surely the first artist would feel deeply insulted, and his
   indignation would be justly roused. Dost thou, then, think that thou
   wilt carry off with impunity so audacious an act of wickedness, such an
   insult to God the great artifices? For, granting that thou art not
   immodest in thy behaviour towards men, and that thou art not polluted
   in mind by these meretricious deceits, yet, in corrupting and violating
   what is God's, thou provest thyself worse than an adulteress. The fact
   that thou considerest thyself adorned and beautified by such arts is an
   impeachment of God's handiwork, and a violation of truth. Listen to the
   warning voice of the apostle: 'Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be
   a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is
   sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old
   leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the
   unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.' Now can sincerity and truth
   continue to exist when what is sincere is polluted, and what is true is
   changed by meretricious colouring and the deceptions of quackery into a
   lie? Thy Lord says, 'Thou can't not make one hair white or black;' and
   dost thou wish to have greater power so as to bring to nought the words
   of thy Lord? With rash and sacrilegious hand thou wouldst fain change
   the colour of thy hair: I would that, with a prophetic look to the
   future, thou shouldst dye it the color of flame." It would be too long
   to quote all that follows.

   50. Ambrose again, inveighing against such practices, says: "Hence
   arise these incentives to vice, that women, in their fear that they may
   not prove attractive to men, paint their faces with carefully-chosen
   colours, and then from stains on their features go on to stains on
   their chastity. What folly it is to change the features of nature into
   those of a painting, and from fear of incurring their husband's
   disapproval, to proclaim openly that they have incurred their own! For
   the woman who desires to alter her natural appearance pronounces
   condemnation on herself; and her eager endeavours to please another
   prove that she has first been displeasing to herself. And what
   testimony to thine ugliness can we find, O woman, that is more
   unquestionable than thine own, when thou art afraid to show thyself? If
   thou art comely why dost thou hide thy comeliness? If thou art plain,
   why test thou lyingly pretend to be beautiful, when thou can't not
   enjoy the pleasure of the lie either in thine own consciousness or in
   that of another? For he loves another woman, thou desires to please
   another man; and thou art angry if he love another, though he is taught
   adultery in thee. Thou art the evil promptress of thine own injury. For
   even the woman who has been the victim of a pander shrinks from acting
   the pander's part, and though she be vile, it is herself she sins
   against and not another. The crime of adultery is almost more tolerable
   than thine; for adultery tampers with modesty, but thou with nature."
   It is sufficiently clear, I think, that this eloquence calls
   passionately upon women to avoid tampering with their appearance by
   deceitful arts, and to cultivate modesty and fear. Accordingly, we
   notice that the style is neither subdued nor temperate, but majestic
   throughout. Now in these two authors whom I have selected as specimens
   of the rest, and in other ecclesiastical writers who both speak the
   truth and speak it well,--speak it, that is, judiciously, pointedly,
   and with beauty and power of expression,--many examples may be found of
   the three styles of speech, scattered through their various writings
   and discourses; and the diligent student may by assiduous reading,
   intermingled with practice on his own part, become thoroughly imbued
   with them all.

   51. But we are not to suppose that it is against rule to mingle these
   various styles: on the contrary, every variety of style should be
   introduced so far as is consistent with good taste. For when we keep
   monotonously to one style, we fail to retain the hearer's attention;
   but when we pass from one style to another, the discourse goes off more
   gracefully, even though it extend to greater length. Each separate
   style, again, has varieties of its own which prevent the hearer's
   attention from cooling or becoming languid. We can bear the subdued
   style, however, longer without variety than the majestic style. For the
   mental emotion which it is necessary to stir up in order to carry the
   hearer's feelings with us, when once it has been sufficiently excited,
   the higher the pitch to which it is raised, can be maintained the
   shorter time. And therefore we must be on our guard, lest, in striving
   to carry to a higher point the emotion we have excited, we rather lose
   what we have already gained. But after the interposition of matter that
   we have to treat in a quieter style, we can return with good effect to
   that which must be treated forcibly, thus making the tide of eloquence
   to ebb and flow like the sea. It follows from this, that the majestic
   style, if it is to be long continued, ought not to be unvaried, but
   should alternate at intervals with the other styles; the speech or
   writing as a whole, however, being referred to that style which is the
   prevailing one.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 23

   52. Now it is a matter of importance to determine what style should be
   alternated with what other, and the places where it is necessary that
   any particular style should be used. In the majestic style, for
   instance, it is always, or almost always, desirable that the
   introduction should be temperate. And the speaker has it in his
   discretion to use the subdued style even where the majestic would be
   allowable, in order that the majestic when it is used may be the more
   majestic by comparison and may as it were shine out with greater
   brilliance from the dark background. Again, whatever may be the style
   of the speech or writing, when knotty questions turn up for solution,
   accuracy of distinction is required, and this naturally demands the
   subdued style. And accordingly this style must be used in alternation
   with the other two styles whenever questions of that sort turn up; just
   as we must use the temperate style, no matter what may be the general
   tone of the discourse, whenever praise or blame is to be given without
   any ulterior reference to the condemnation or acquittal of any one, or
   to obtaining the concurrence of any one in a course of action. In the
   majestic style, then, and in the quiet likewise, both the other two
   styles occasionally find place. The temperate style, on the other hand,
   not indeed always, but occasionally, needs the quiet style; for
   example, when, as I have said, a knotty question comes up to be
   settled, or when some points that are susceptible of ornament are left
   unadorned and expressed in the quiet style, in order to give greater
   effect to certain exuberances (as they may be called) of ornament. But
   the temperate style never needs the aid of the majestic; for its object
   is to gratify, never to excite, the mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 24

   53. If frequent and vehement applause follows a speaker, we are not to
   suppose on that account that he is speaking in the majestic style; for
   this effect is often produced both by the accurate distinctions of the
   quiet style, and by the beauties of the temperate. The majestic style,
   on the other hand, frequently silences the audience by its
   impressiveness, but calls forth their tears. For example, when at
   Caesarean in Mauritania I was dissuading the people from that civil, or
   worse than civil, war which they called Ceterva (for it was not
   fellow-citizens merely, but neighbours, brothers, fathers and sons
   even, who, divided into two factions and armed with stones, fought
   annually at a certain season of the year for several days continuously,
   every one killing whomsoever he could), I strove with all the vehemence
   of speech that I could command to root out and drive from their hearts
   and lives an evil so cruel and inveterate; it was not, however, when I
   heard their applause, but when I saw their tears, that I thought I had
   produced an effect. For the applause showed that they were instructed
   and delighted, but the tears that they were subdued. And when I saw
   their tears I was confident, even before the event proved it, that this
   horrible and barbarous custom (which had been handed down to them from
   their fathers and their ancestors of generations long gone by and which
   like an enemy was besieging their hearts, or rather had complete
   possession of them) was overthrown; and immediately that my sermon was
   finished I called upon them with heart and voice to give praise and
   thanks to God. And, lo, with the blessing of Christ, it is now eight
   years or more since anything of the sort was attempted there. In many
   other cases besides I have observed that men show the effect made on
   them by the powerful eloquence of a wise man, not by clamorous applause
   so much as by groans, sometimes even by tears, finally by change of
   life.

   54. The quiet style, too, has made a change in many; but it was to
   teach them what they were ignorant of, or to persuade them of what they
   thought incredible, not to make them do what they knew they ought to do
   but were unwilling to do. To break down hardness of this sort, speech
   needs to be vehement. Praise and censure, too, when they are eloquently
   expressed, even in the temperate style, produce such an effect on some,
   that they are not only pleased with the eloquence of the encomiums and
   censures, but are led to live so as themselves to deserve praise, and
   to avoid living so as to incur blame. But no one would say that all who
   are thus delighted change their habits in consequence, whereas all who
   are moved by the majestic style act accordingly, and all who are taught
   by the quiet style know or believe a truth which they were previously
   ignorant of.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 25

   55. From all this we may conclude, that the end arrived at by the two
   styles last mentioned is the one which it is most essential for those
   who aspire to speak with wisdom and eloquence to secure. On the other
   hand, what the temperate style properly aims at, viz., to please by
   beauty of expressions, is not in itself an adequate end; but when what
   we have to say is good and useful, and when the hearers are both
   acquainted with it and favourably disposed towards it, so that it is
   not necessary either to instruct or persuade them, beauty of style may
   have its influence in securing their prompter compliance, or in making
   them adhere to it more tenaciously. For as the function of all
   eloquence, whichever of these three forms it may assume, is to speak
   persuasively, and its object is to persuade, an eloquent man will speak
   persuasively, whatever style he may adopt; but unless he succeeds in
   persuading, his eloquence has not secured its object. Now in the
   subdued style, he persuades his hearers that what he says is true; in
   the majestic style, he persuades them to do what they are aware they
   ought to do, but do not; in the temperate style, he persuades them that
   his speech is elegant and ornate. But what use is there in attaining
   such an object as this last? They may desire it who are vain of their
   eloquence and make a boast of panegyrics, and suchlike performances,
   where the object is not to instruct the hearer, or to persuade him to
   any course of action, but merely to give him pleasure. We, however,
   ought to make that end subordinate to another, viz., the effecting by
   this style of eloquence what we aim at effecting when we use the
   majestic style. For we may by the use of this style persuade men to
   cultivate good habits and give up evil ones, if they are not so
   hardened as to need the vehement style; or if they have already begun a
   good course, we may induce them to pursue it more zealously, and to
   persevere in it with constancy. Accordingly, even in the temperate
   style we must use beauty of expression not for ostentation, but for
   wise ends; not contenting ourselves merely with pleasing the hearer,
   but rather seeking to aid him in the pursuit of the good end which we
   hold out before him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 26

   56. Now in regard to the three conditions I laid down a little while
   ago as necessary to be fulfilled by any one who wishes to speak with
   wisdom and eloquence, viz. perspicuity, beauty of style, and persuasive
   power, we are not to understand that these three qualities attach
   themselves respectively to the three several styles of speech, one to
   each, so that perspicuity is a merit peculiar to the subdued style,
   beauty to the temperate, and persuasive power to the majestic. On the
   contrary, all speech, whatever its style, ought constantly to aim at,
   and as far as possible to display, all these three merits. For we do
   not like even what we say in the subdued style to pall upon the hearer;
   and therefore we would be listened to, not with intelligence merely,
   but with pleasure as well. Again, why do we enforce what we teach by
   divine testimony, except that we wish to carry the hearer with us, that
   is, to compel his assert by calling in the assistance of Him of whom it
   is said, "Thy testimonies are very sure"? And when any one narrates a
   story, even in the subdued style, what does he wish but to be believed?
   But who will listen to him if he do not arrest attention by some beauty
   of style? And if he be not intelligible, is it not plain that he can
   neither give pleasure nor enforce conviction? The subdued style, again,
   in its own naked simplicity, when it unravels questions of very great
   difficulty, and throws an unexpected light upon them; when it worms out
   and brings to light some very acute observations from a quarter whence
   nothing was expected; when it seizes upon and exposes the falsity of an
   opposing opinion, which seemed at its first statement to be
   unassailable; especially when all this is accompanied by a natural,
   unsought grace of expression, and by a rhythm and balance of style
   which is not ostentatiously obtruded, but seems rather to be called
   forth by the nature of the subject: this style, so used, frequently
   calls forth applause so great that one can hardly believe it to be the
   subdued style. For the fact that it comes forth without either ornament
   or defense, and offers battle in its own naked simplicity, does not
   hinder it from crushing its adversary by weight of nerve and muscle,
   and overwhelming and destroying the falsehood that opposes it by the
   mere strength of its own right arm. How explain the frequent and
   vehement applause that waits upon men who speak thus, except by the
   pleasure that truth so irresistibly established, and so victoriously
   defended, naturally affords? Wherefore the Christian teacher speaker
   ought, when he uses the subdued style, to endeavour not only to be
   clear and intelligible, but to give pleasure and to bring home
   conviction to the hearer.

   57. Eloquence of the temperate style, also, must, in the case of the
   Christian orator, be neither altogether without ornament, nor
   unsuitably adorned, nor is it to make the giving of pleasure its sole
   aim, which is all it professes to accomplish in the hands of others;
   but in its encomiums and censures it should aim at inducing the hearer
   to strive after or hold more firmly by what it praises, and to avoid or
   renounce what it condemns. On the other hand, without perspicuity this
   style cannot give pleasure. And so the three qualities, perspicuity,
   beauty, and persuasiveness, are to be sought in this style also;
   beauty, of course, being its primary object.

   58. Again, when it becomes necessary to stir and sway the hearer's mind
   by the majestic style (and this is always necessary when he admits that
   what you say is both true and agreeable, and yet is unwilling to act
   accordingly), you must, of course, speak in the majestic style. But who
   can be moved if he does not understand what is said? And who will stay
   to listen if he receives no pleasure? Wherefore, in this style, too,
   when an obdurate heart is to be persuaded to obedience, you must speak
   so as to be both intelligible and pleasing, if you would be heard with
   a submissive mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 27

   59. But whatever may be the majesty of the style, the life of the
   speaker will count for more in securing the hearer's compliance. The
   man who speaks wisely and eloquently, but lives wickedly, may, it is
   true, instruct many who are anxious to learn; though, as it is written,
   he "is unprofitable to himself." Wherefore, also, the apostle says:
   "Whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached." Now Christ is the
   truth; yet we see that the truth can be preached, though not in truth,
   that is, what is right and true in itself may be preached by a man of
   perverse and deceitful mind. And thus it is that Jesus Christ is
   preached by those that seek their own, and not the things that are
   Jesus Christ's. But since true believers obey the voice, not of any
   man, but of the Lord Himself, who says, "All therefore whatsoever they
   bid you observe, that observe and do: but do not ye after their works;
   for they say and do not;" and therefore it is that men who themselves
   lead unprofitable lives are heard with profit by others. For though
   they seek their own objects, they do not dare to teach their own
   doctrines, sitting as they do in the high places of ecclesiastical
   authority, which is established on sound doctrine. Wherefore our Lord
   Himself, before saying what I have just quoted about men of this stamp,
   made this observation: "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses's
   seat." The seat they occupied then, which was not theirs but Moses',
   compelled them to say what was good, though they did what was evil. And
   so they followed their own course in their lives, but were prevented by
   the seat they occupied, which belonged to another, from preaching their
   own doctrines.

   60. Now these men do good to many by preaching what they themselves do
   not perform; but they would do good to very many more if they lived as
   they preach. For there are numbers who seek an excuse for their own
   evil lives in comparing the teaching with the conduct of their
   instructors, and who say in their hearts, or even go a little further,
   and say with their lips: Why do you not do yourself what you bid me do?
   And thus they cease to listen with submission to a man who does not
   listen to himself, and in despising the preacher they learn to despise
   the word that is preached. Wherefore the apostle, writing to Timothy,
   after telling him, "Let no man despise thy youth," adds immediately the
   course by which he would avoid contempt: "but be thou an example of the
   believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith,
   in purity."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 28

   61. Such a teacher as is here described may, to secure compliance,
   speak not only quietly and temperately, but even vehemently, without
   any breach of modesty, because his life protects him against contempt.
   For while he pursues an upright life, he takes care to maintain a good
   reputation as well, providing things honest in the sight of God and
   men, fearing God, and caring for men. In his very speech even he
   prefers to please by matter rather than by words; thinks that a thing
   is well said in proportion as it is true in fact, and that a teacher
   should govern his words, not let the words govern him. This is what the
   apostle says: "Not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ
   should be made of none effect." To the same effect also is what he says
   to Timothy: "Charging them before the Lord that they strive not about
   words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers." Now this
   does not mean that, when adversaries oppose the truth, we are to say
   nothing in defense of the truth. For where, then, would be what he says
   when he is describing the sort of man a bishop ought to be: "that he
   may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and convince the
   gainsayers?" To strive about words is not to be careful about the way
   to overcome error by truth, but to be anxious that your mode of
   expression should be preferred to that of another. The man who does not
   strive about words, whether he speak quietly, temperately, or
   vehemently, uses words with no other purpose than to make the truth
   plain, pleasing and effective; for not even love itself, which is the
   end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law, can be rightly
   exercised unless the objects of love are true and not false. For as a
   man with a comely body but an ill-conditioned mind is a more painful
   object than if his body too were deformed, so men who teach lies are
   the more pitiable if they happen to be eloquent in speech. To speak
   eloquently, then, and wisely as well, is just to express truths which
   it is expedient to teach in fit and proper words,--words which in the
   subdued style are adequate, in the temperate, elegant, and in the
   majestic, forcible. But the man who cannot speak both eloquently and
   wisely should speak wisely without eloquence, rather than eloquently
   without wisdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 29

   If, however, he cannot do even this, let his life be such as shall not
   only secure a reward for himself, but afford an example to others; and
   let his manner of living be an eloquent sermon in itself.

   62. There are, indeed, some men who have a good delivery, but cannot
   compose anything to deliver. Now, if such men take what has been
   written with wisdom and eloquence by others, and commit it to memory,
   and deliver it to the people, they cannot be blamed, supposing them to
   do it without deception. For in this way many become preachers of the
   truth (which is certainly desirable), and yet not many teachers; for
   all deliver the discourse which one real teacher has composed, and
   there are no divisions among them. Nor are such men to be alarmed by
   the words of Jeremiah the prophet, through whom God denounces those who
   steal His words every one from his neighbour. For those who steal take
   what does not belong to them, but the word of God belongs to all who
   obey it; and it is the man who speaks well, but lives badly, who really
   takes the words that belong to another. For the good things he says
   seem to be the result of his own thought, and yet they have nothing in
   common with his manner of life. And so God has said that they steal His
   words who would appear good by speaking God's words, but are in fact
   bad, as they follow their own ways. And if you look closely into the
   matter, it is not really themselves who say the good things they say.
   For how can they say in words what they deny in deeds? It is not for
   nothing that the apostle says of such men: "They profess that they know
   God, but in works they deny Him." In one sense, then, they do say the
   things, and in another sense they do not say them; for both these
   statements must be true, both being made by Him who is the Truth.
   Speaking of such men, in one place He says, "Whatsoever they bid you
   observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works; "that is
   to say, what ye hear from their lips, that do; what ye see in their
   lives, that do ye not;--"for they say and do not." And so, though they
   do not, yet they say. But in another place, upbraiding such men, He
   says, "O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
   things?" And from this it would appear that even what they say, when
   they say what is good, it is not themselves who say, for in will and in
   deed they deny what they say. Hence it happens that a wicked man who is
   eloquent may compose a discourse in which the truth is set forth to be
   delivered by a good man who is not eloquent; and when this takes place,
   the former draws from himself what does not belong to him, and the
   latter receives from another what really belongs to himself. But when
   true believers render this service to true believers, both parties
   speak what is their own, for God is theirs, to whom belongs all that
   they say; and even those who could not compose what they say make it
   their own by composing their lives in harmony with it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 30

   63. But whether a man is going to address the people or to dictate what
   others will deliver or read to the people, he ought to pray God to put
   into his mouth a suitable discourse. For if Queen Esther prayed, when
   she was about to speak to the king touching the temporal welfare of her
   race, that God would put fit words into her mouth, how much more ought
   he to pray for the same blessing who labours in word and doctrine for
   the eternal welfare of men? Those, again, who are to deliver what
   others compose for them ought, before they receive their discourse, to
   pray for those who are preparing it; and when they have received it,
   they ought to pray both that they themselves may deliver it well, and
   that those to whom they address it may give ear; and when the discourse
   has a happy issue, they ought to render thanks to Him from whom they
   know such blessings come, so that all the praise may be His "in whose
   hand are both we and our words."

  Chapter 31

   64. This book has extended to a greater length than I expected or
   desired. But the reader or hearer who finds pleasure in it will not
   think it long. He who thinks it long, but is anxious to know its
   contents, may read it in parts. He who does not care to be acquainted
   with it need not complain of its length. I, however, give thanks to God
   that with what little ability I possess I have in these four books
   striven to depict, not the sort of man I am myself (for my defects are
   very many), but the sort of man he ought to be who desires to labour in
   sound, that is, in Christian doctrine, not for his own instruction
   only, but for that of others also.
