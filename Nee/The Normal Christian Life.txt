PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

   The author of these studies, Mr. Watchman Nee (Nee To-sheng) of
   Foochow, a true bondservant of Jesus Christ, placed a great many of us
   in his debt when, on a visit to Europe in 1938 and 1939, he set forth
   so lucidly in his ministry to many groups of young workers and others
   the foundation principles of the Christian life and walk.

   Several of the addresses forming the material from which this book has
   been compiled have already been published independently and have been
   the means of blessing to many. Others, covering similar but wider
   ground, have existed for long in manuscript or note form. It is with
   the conviction that their message merits a wider circulation at the
   present time that I have undertaken the editing of the available
   material to form this larger book.

   Being deprived of personal contact or communication with the author, I
   have myself to take full responsibility for the work of editing. This
   has involved the bringing together of matter from a number of sources
   to form a logical sequence within the framework provided by two of the
   original series of studies. Due to the wide variety of this material,
   including verbatim records of spoken English addresses, private notes
   of Bible readings and personal conversations, and a few translations
   from the Chinese, liberties, perforce, have had to be taken with the
   literary arrangement--not, of course, with the doctrine--making the
   hand of the editor more evident than I would have wished. But the
   privilege of close personal contact with Mr. Nee during 1938, and the
   help and criticism of others who enjoyed his ministry or who have
   worked with him, and who knew him better than I, have combined, in the
   few places where interpretation was necessary, to make faithfulness to
   his thought the more certain.

   Work on this book has been a searching experience. It goes out now with
   the prayer that its strong emphasis upon the greatness of Christ and
   upon the finality and sufficiency of His work may be used of God to
   bring His children to a place of greater spiritual effectiveness and
   thus of increasing value to Him.

PREFACE TO THE BRITISH EDITION

   A new edition has made possible further revision and occasional slight
   expansion of the text with the aid of fresh source material. An index
   is now provided.

   The reader is again reminded that the author's message in this
   collected form had its origin as spoken ministry. It is therefore not
   wholly systematic. On none of the subjects dealt with is it to be
   regarded as exhaustive. It should be approached prayerfully--not as a
   treatise, but as a living message to the heart.

Chapter 1: The Blood of Christ

   What is the normal Christian life? We do well at the outset to ponder
   this question. The object of these studies is to show that it is
   something very different from the life of the average Christian. Indeed
   a consideration of the written Word of God--of the Sermon on the Mount
   for example--should lead us to ask whether such a life has ever in fact
   been lived upon the earth, save only by the Son of God Himself. But in
   that last saving clause lies immediately the answer to our question.

   The Apostle Paul gives us his own definition of the Christian life in
   Galatians 2:20. It is "no longer I, but Christ". Here he is not stating
   something special or peculiar--a high level of Christianity. He is, we
   believe, presenting God's normal for a Christian, which can be
   summarized in the words: I live no longer, but Christ lives His life in
   me.

   God makes it quite clear in His Word that He has only one answer to
   every human need--His Son, Jesus Christ. In all His dealings with us He
   works by taking us out of the way and substituting Christ in our place.
   The Son of God died instead of us for our forgiveness: He lives instead
   of us for our deliverance. So we can speak of two substitutions--a
   Substitute on the Cross who secures our forgiveness and a Substitute
   within who secures our victory. It will help us greatly, and save us
   from much confusion, if we keep constantly before us this fact, that
   God will answer all our questions in one way only, namely, by showing
   us more of His Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

Our Dual Problem: Sins and Sin

   We shall take now as a starting-point for our study of the normal
   Christian life that great exposition of it which we find in the first
   eight chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, and we shall approach our
   subject from a practical and experimental point of view. It will be
   helpful first of all to point out a natural division of this section of
   Romans into two, and to note certain striking differences in the
   subject-matter of its two parts.

   The first eight chapters of Romans form a self-contained unit. The
   four-and-a-half chapters from 1:1 to 5:11 form the first half of this
   unit and the three-and-a-half chapters from 5:12 to 8:39 the second
   half. A careful reading will show us that the subject-matter of the two
   halves is not the same. For example, in the argument of the first
   section we find the plural word sins' given prominence. In the second
   section, however, this changed, for while the word sins' hardly occurs
   once, the singular word sin' is used again and again and is the subject
   mainly dealt with. Why is this?

   It is because in the first section it is a question of the sins I have
   committed before God, which are many and can be enumerated, whereas in
   the second it is a question of sin as a principle working in me. No
   matter how many sins I commit, it is always the one sin principle that
   leads to them. I need forgiveness for my sins, but I need also
   deliverance from the power of sin. The former touches my conscience,
   the latter my life. I may receive forgiveness for all my sins, but
   because of my sin I have, even then, no abiding peace of mind.

   When God's light first shines into my heart my one cry is for
   forgiveness, for I realize I have committed sins before Him; but when
   once I have received forgiveness of sins I make a new discovery,
   namely, the discovery of sin, and I realize not only that I have
   committed sins before God but that there is something wrong within. I
   discover that I have the nature of a sinner. There is an inward
   inclination to sin, a power within that draws to sin. When that power
   breaks out I commit sins. I may seek and receive forgiveness, but then
   I sin once more. So life goes on in a vicious circle of sinning and
   being forgiven and then sinning again. I appreciate the blessed fact of
   God's forgiveness, but I want something more than that: I want
   deliverance. I need forgiveness for what I have done, but I need also
   deliverance from what I am.
     __________________________________________________________________

God's Dual Remedy: The Blood and the Cross

   Thus in the first eight chapters of Romans two aspects of salvation are
   presented to us: firstly, the forgiveness of our sins, and secondly,
   our deliverance from sin. But now, in keeping with this fact, we must
   notice a further difference.

   In the first part of Romans 1 to 8, we twice have reference to the
   Blood of the Lord Jesus, in chapter 3:25 and in chapter 5:9. In the
   second, a new idea is introduced in chapter 6:6, where we are said to
   have been "crucified" with Christ. The argument of the first part
   gathers round that aspect of the work of the Lord Jesus which is
   represented by the Blood' shed for our justification through "the
   remission of sins". This terminology is however not carried on into the
   second section, where the argument centers now in the aspect of His
   work represented by the Cross', that is to say, by our union with
   Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. This distinction is a
   valuable one. We shall see that the Blood deals with what we have done,
   whereas the Cross deals with what we are. The Blood disposes of our
   sins, while the Cross strikes at the root of our capacity for sin. The
   latter aspect will be the subject of our consideration in later
   chapters.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Problem Of Our Sins

   We begin, then, with the precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and
   its value to us in dealing with our sins and justifying us in the sight
   of God. This is set forth for us in the following passages:

   "All have sinned" (Romans 3:23). "God commendeth his own love toward
   us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more
   then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the
   wrath of God through him" (Romans 5:8, 9). "Being justified freely by
   his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God set
   forth to be a propitiation, through faith, by his blood, to shew his
   righteousness, because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime,
   in the forbearance of God; for the shewing, I say, of his righteousness
   at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the
   justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus" (Romans 3:24-26).

   We shall have reason at a later stage in our study to look closely at
   the real nature of the fall and the way of recovery. At this point we
   will just remind ourselves that when sin came in it found expression in
   an act of disobedience to God (Romans 5:19). Now we must remember that
   whenever this occurs the thing that immediately follows is guilt.

   Sin enters as disobedience, to create first of all a separation between
   God and man whereby man is put away from God. God can no longer have
   fellowship with him, for there is something now which hinders, and it
   is that which is known throughout Scripture as sin'. Thus it is first
   of all God who says, "They are all under sin" (Romans 3:9). Then,
   secondly, that sin in man, which henceforth constitutes a barrier to
   his fellowship with God, gives rise in him to a sense of guilt--of
   estrangement from God. Here it is man himself who, with the help of his
   awakened conscience, says, "I have sinned" (Luke 15:18). Nor is this
   all, for sin also provides Satan with his ground of accusation before
   God, while our sense of guilt gives him his ground of accusation in our
   hearts; so that, thirdly, it is the accuser of the brethren' (Rev.
   12:10) who now says, You have sinned'.

   To redeem us, therefore, and to bring us back to the purpose of God,
   the Lord Jesus had to do something about these three questions of sin
   and of guilt and of Satan's charge against us. Our sins had first to be
   dealt with, and this was effected by the precious Blood of Christ. Our
   guilt has to be dealt with and our guilty conscience set at rest by
   showing us the value of that Blood. And finally the attack of the enemy
   has to be met and his accusations answered. In the Scriptures the Blood
   of Christ is shown to operate effectually in these three ways, Godward,
   manward and Satanward.

   There is thus an absolute need for us to appropriate these values of
   the Blood if we are to go on. This is a first essential. We must have a
   basic knowledge of the fact of the death of the Lord Jesus as our
   Substitute upon the Cross, and a clear apprehension of the efficacy of
   His Blood for our sins, for without this we cannot be said to have
   started upon our road. Let us look then at these three matters more
   closely.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Blood Is Primarily For God

   The Blood is for atonement and has to do first with our standing before
   God. We need forgiveness for the sins we have committed, lest we come
   under judgment; and they are forgiven, not because God overlooks what
   we have done but because He sees the Blood. The Blood is therefore not
   primarily for us but for God. If I want to understand the value of the
   Blood I must accept God's valuation of it, and if I do not know
   something of the value set upon the Blood by God I shall never know
   what its value is for me. It is only as the estimate that God puts upon
   the Blood of Christ is made known to me by His Holy Spirit that I come
   into the good of it myself and find how precious indeed the Blood is to
   me. But the first aspect of it is Godward. Throughout the Old and New
   Testaments the word blood' is used in connection with the idea of
   atonement, I think over a hundred times, and throughout it is something
   for God.

   In the Old Testament calendar there is one day that has a great bearing
   on the matter of our sins and that day is the Day of Atonement. Nothing
   explains this question of sins so clearly as the description of that
   day. In Leviticus 16 we find that on the Day of Atonement the blood was
   taken from the sin offering and brought into the Most Holy Place and
   there sprinkled before the Lord seven times. We must be very clear
   about this. On that day the sin offering was offered publicly in the
   court of the tabernacle. Everything was there in full view and could be
   seen by all. But the Lord commanded that no man should enter the
   tabernacle itself except the high priest. It was he alone who took the
   blood and, going into the Most Holy Place, sprinkled it there to make
   atonement before the Lord. Why? Because the high priest was a type of
   the Lord Jesus in His redemptive work (Hebrews 9:12), and so, in
   figure, he was the one who did the work. None but he could even draw
   near to enter in. Moreover, connected with his going in there was but
   one act, namely, the presenting of the blood to God as something He had
   accepted, something in which He could find satisfaction. It was a
   transaction between the high priest and God in the Sanctuary, away from
   the eyes of the men who were to benefit by it. The Lord required that.
   The Blood is therefore in the first place for Him.

   Earlier even than this there is described in Exodus 12:13 the shedding
   of the blood of the passover lamb in Egypt for Israel's redemption.
   This is again, I think, one of the best types in the Old Testament of
   our redemption. The blood was put on the lintel and on the door-posts,
   whereas the meat, the flesh of the lamb, was eaten inside the house;
   and God said: "When I see the blood, I will pass over you". Here we
   have another illustration of the fact that the blood was not meant to
   be presented to man but to God, for the blood was put on the lintel and
   on the door-posts, where those feasting inside the house would not see
   it.
     __________________________________________________________________

God Is Satisfied

   It is God's holiness, God's righteousness, which demands that a sinless
   life should be given for man. There is life in the Blood, and that
   Blood has to be poured out for me, for my sins. God is the One who
   requires it to be so. God is the One who demands that the Blood be
   presented, in order to satisfy His own righteousness, and it is He who
   says: When I see the blood', I will pass over you.' The Blood of Christ
   wholly satisfies God.

   Now I desire to say a word at this point to my younger brethren in the
   Lord, for it is here that we often get into difficulties. As
   unbelievers we may have been wholly untroubled by our conscience until
   the Word of God began to arouse us. Our conscience was dead, and those
   with dead consciences are certainly of no use to God. But later, when
   we believed, our awakened conscience may have become acutely sensitive,
   and this can constitute a real problem to us. The sense of sin and
   guilt can become so great, so terrible, as almost to cripple us by
   causing us to lose sight of the true effectiveness of the Blood. It
   seems to us that our sins are so real, and some particular sin may
   trouble us so many times, that we come to the point where to us our
   sins loom larger than the Blood of Christ.

   Now the whole trouble with us is that we are trying to sense it; we are
   trying to feel its value and to estimate subjectively what the Blood is
   for us. We cannot do it; it does not work that way. The Blood is first
   for God to see. We then have to accept God's valuation of it. In doing
   so we shall find our valuation. If instead we try to come to a
   valuation by way of our feelings we get nothing; we remain in darkness.
   No, it is a matter of faith in God's Word. We have to believe that the
   Blood is precious to God because He says it is so (1 Peter 1:18, 19).
   If God can accept the Blood as a payment for our sins and as the price
   of our redemption, then we can rest assured that the debt has been
   paid. If God is satisfied with the Blood, then the Blood must be
   acceptable. Our valuation of it is only according to His
   valuation--neither more nor less. It cannot, of course, be more, but it
   must not be less. Let us remember that He is holy and He is righteous,
   and that a holy and righteous God has the right to say that the Blood
   is acceptable in His eyes and has fully satisfied Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Blood And The Believer's Access

   The Blood has satisfied God; it must satisfy us also. It has therefore
   a second value that is manward in the cleansing of our conscience. When
   we come to the Epistle to the Hebrews we find that the Blood does this.
   We are to have "hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" (Hebrews
   10:22).

   This is most important. Look carefully at what it says. The writer does
   not tell us that the Blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses our hearts, and
   then stop there in his statement. We are wrong to connect the heart
   with the Blood in quite that way. It may show a misunderstanding of the
   sphere in which the Blood operates to pray, Lord, cleanse my heart from
   sin by Thy Blood'. The heart, God says, is "desperately sick" (Jeremiah
   17:9), and He must do something more fundamental than cleanse it: He
   must give us a new one.

   We do not wash and iron clothing that we are going to throw away. As we
   shall shortly see, the flesh' is too bad to be cleansed; it must be
   crucified. The work of God within us must be something wholly new. "A
   new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you"
   (Ezekiel 36:26).

   No, I do not find it stated that the Blood cleanses our hearts. Its
   work is not subjective in that way, but wholly objective, before God.
   True, the cleansing work of the Blood is seen here in Hebrews 10 to
   have reference to the heart, but it is in relation to the conscience.
   "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience". What then is the
   meaning of this?

   It means that there was something intervening between myself and God,
   as a result of which I had an evil conscience whenever I sought to
   approach Him. It was constantly reminding me of the barrier that stood
   between myself and Him. But now, through the operation of the precious
   Blood, something new has been effected before God which has removed
   that barrier, and God has made that fact known to me in His Word. When
   that has been believed in and accepted, my conscience is at once
   cleared and my sense of guilt removed, and I have no more an evil
   conscience toward God.

   Every one of us knows what a precious thing it is to have a conscience
   void of offense in our dealings with God. A heart of faith and a
   conscience clear of any and every accusation are both equally essential
   to us, since they are interdependent. As soon as we find our conscience
   is uneasy our faith leaks away and immediately we find we cannot face
   God. In order therefore to keep going on with God we must know the
   up-to-date value of the Blood. God keeps short accounts, and we are
   made nigh by the Blood every day, every hour and every minute. It never
   loses its efficacy as our ground of access if we will but lay hold upon
   it. When we enter the most Holy Place, on what ground dare we enter but
   by the Blood?

   But I want to ask myself, am I really seeking the way into the Presence
   of God by the Blood or by something else? What do I mean when I say, by
   the Blood'? I mean simply that I recognize my sins, that I confess that
   I have need of cleansing and of atonement, and that I come to God on
   the basis of the finished work of the Lord Jesus. I approach God
   through His merit alone, and never on the basis of my attainment;
   never, for example, on the ground that I have been extra kind or
   patient today, or that I have done something for the Lord this morning.
   I have to come by way of the Blood every time. The temptation to so
   many of us when we try to approach God is to think that because God has
   been dealing with us--because He has been taking steps to bring us into
   something more of Himself and has been teaching us deeper lessons of
   the Cross--He has thereby set before us new standards, and that only by
   attaining to these can we have a clear conscience before Him. No! A
   clear conscience is never based upon our attainment; it can only be
   based on the work of the Lord Jesus in the shedding of His Blood.

   I may be mistaken, but I feel very strongly that some of us are
   thinking in terms such as these: Today I have been a little more
   careful; today I have been doing a little better; this morning I have
   been reading the Word of God in a warmer way, so today I can pray
   better!' Or again, Today I have had a little difficulty with the
   family; I began the day feeling very gloomy and moody; I am not feeling
   too bright now; it seems that there must be something wrong; therefore
   I cannot approach God.'

   What, after all, is your basis of approach to God? Do you come to Him
   on the uncertain ground of your feeling, the feeling that you may have
   achieved something for God today? Or is your approach based on
   something far more secure, namely, the fact that the Blood has been
   shed, and that God looks on that Blood and is satisfied? Of course,
   were it conceivably possible for the Blood to suffer any change, the
   basis of your approach to God might be less trustworthy. But the Blood
   has never changed and never will. Your approach to God is therefore
   always in boldness; and that boldness is yours through the Blood and
   never through your personal attainment. Whatever be your measure of
   attainment today or yesterday or the day before, as soon as you make a
   conscious move into the Most Holy Place, immediately you have to take
   your stand upon the safe and only ground of the shed Blood. Whether you
   have had a good day or a bad day, whether you have consciously sinned
   or not, your basis of approach is always the same--the Blood of Christ.
   That is the ground upon which you may enter, and there is no other.

   As with many other stages of our Christian experience, this matter of
   access to God has two phases, an initial and a progressive one. The
   former is presented to us in Ephesians 2 and the latter in Hebrews 10.
   Initially, our standing with God was secured by the Blood, for we are
   "made nigh in the blood of Christ" (Eph. 2:13). But thereafter our
   ground of continual access is still by the Blood, for the apostle
   exhorts us: "Having therefore... boldness to enter into the holy place
   by the blood of Jesus... let us draw near" (Heb. 10:19, 22). To begin
   with I was made nigh by the Blood, and to continue in that new
   relationship I come through the Blood every time. It is not that I was
   saved on one basis and that I now maintain my fellowship on another.
   You say, 'That is very simple; it is the A.B.C. of the Gospel.' Yes,
   but the trouble with many of us is that we have moved away from the
   A.B.C. We have thought we had progressed and so could dispense with it,
   but we can never do so. No, my initial approach to God is by the Blood,
   and every time I come before Him it is the same. Right to the end it
   will always and only be on the ground of the Blood.

   This does not mean at all that we should live a careless life, for we
   shall shortly study another aspect of the death of Christ which shows
   us that anything but that is contemplated. But for the present let us
   be satisfied with the Blood, that it is there and that it is enough.

   We may be weak, but looking at our weakness will never make us strong.
   No trying to feel bad and doing penance will help us to be even a
   little holier. There is no help there, so let us be bold in our
   approach because of the Blood: Lord, I do not know fully what the value
   of the Blood is, but I know that the Blood has satisfied Thee; so the
   Blood is enough for me, and it is my only plea. I see now that whether
   I have really progressed, whether I have really attained to something
   or not, is not the point. Whenever I come before Thee, it is always on
   the ground of the precious Blood. Then our conscience is really clear
   before God. No conscience could ever be clear apart from the Blood. It
   is the Blood that gives us boldness.

   "No more conscience of sins": these are tremendous words of Hebrews
   10:2. We are cleansed from every sin; and we may truly echo the words
   of Paul: "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin"
   (Romans 4:8).
     __________________________________________________________________

Overcoming The Accuser

   In view of what we have said we can now turn to face the enemy, for
   there is a further aspect of the Blood which is Satanward. Satan's most
   strategic activity in this day is as the accuser of the brethren (Rev.
   12:10) and it is as this that our Lord confronts him with His special
   ministry as High Priest "through his own blood" (Hebrews 9:12).

   How then does the Blood operate against Satan? It does so by putting
   God on the side of man against him. The Fall brought something into man
   which gave Satan a footing within him, with the result that God was
   compelled to withdraw Himself. Man is now outside the garden--beyond
   reach of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)--because he is inwardly
   estranged from God. Because of what man has done, there is something in
   him which, until it is removed, renders God morally unable to defend
   him. But the Blood removes that barrier and restores man to God and God
   to man. Man is in favour now, and because God is on his side he can
   face Satan without fear.

   You remember that verse in John's first Epistle--and this is the
   translation of it I like best: "The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us
   from every sin" [1] It is not exactly "all sin" in the general sense,
   but every sin, every item. What does it mean? Oh, it is a marvelous
   thing! God is the light, and as we walk in the light with Him
   everything is exposed and open to that light, so that God can see it
   all--and yet the Blood is able to cleanse from every sin. What a
   cleansing! It is not that I have not a profound knowledge of myself,
   nor that God has not a perfect knowledge of me. It is not that I try to
   hide something nor that God tries to overlook something. No, it is that
   He is in the light and I too am in the light, and that there the
   precious Blood cleanses me from every sin. The Blood is enough for
   that!

   Some of us, oppressed by our own weakness, may at times have been
   tempted to think that there are sins which are almost unforgivable. Let
   us remember the word: "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us
   from every sin." Big sins, small sins, sins which may be very black and
   sins which appear to be not so black, sins which I think can be
   forgiven and sins which seem unforgivable, yes, all sins, conscious or
   unconscious, remembered or forgotten, are included in those words:
   "every sin". "The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from every sin",
   and it does so because in the first place it satisfies God.

   Since God, seeing all our sins in the light, can forgive them on the
   basis of the Blood, what ground of accusation has Satan? Satan may
   accuse us before Him, but, "If God is for us, who is against us?"
   (Romans 8:31). God points him to the Blood of His dear Son. It is the
   sufficient answer against which Satan has no appeal. "Who shall lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth; who
   is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather,
   that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who
   also maketh intercession for us" (Romans 8:33, 34).

   So here again our need is to recognize the absolute sufficiency of the
   precious Blood. "Christ having come a high priest... through his own
   blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained
   eternal redemption" (Hebrews 9:11, 12). He was Redeemer once. He has
   been High Priest and Advocate for nearly two thousand years. He stands
   there in the presence of God, and "he is the propitiation for our sins"
   (1 John 2:1, 2). Note the words of Hebrews 9:14: "How much more shall
   the blood of Christ..." They underline the sufficiency of His ministry.
   It is enough for God.

   What then of our attitude to Satan? This is important, for he accuses
   us not only before God but in our own conscience also. You have sinned,
   and you keep on sinning. You are weak, and God can have nothing more to
   do with you.' This is his argument. And our temptation is to look
   within and in self-defense to try to find in ourselves, in our feelings
   or our behavior, some ground for believing that Satan is wrong.
   Alternatively we are tempted to admit our helplessness and, going to
   the other extreme, to yield to depression and despair. Thus accusation
   becomes one of the greatest and most effective of Satan's weapons. He
   points to our sins and seeks to charge us with them before God, and if
   we accept his accusations we go down immediately.

   Now the reason why we so readily accept his accusations is that we are
   still hoping to have some righteousness of our own. The ground of our
   expectation is wrong. Satan has succeeded in making us look in the
   wrong direction. Thereby he wins his point, rendering us ineffective.
   But if we have learned to put no confidence in the flesh, we shall not
   wonder if we sin, for the very nature of the flesh is to sin. Do you
   understand what I mean? It is because we have not come to appreciate
   our true nature and to see how helpless we are that we still have some
   expectation in ourselves, with the result that, when Satan comes along
   and accuses us, we go down under it.

   God is well able to deal with our sins; but He cannot deal with a man
   under accusation, because such a man is not trusting in the Blood. The
   Blood speaks in his favour, but his is listening instead to Satan.
   Christ is our Advocate but we, the accused, side with the accuser. We
   have not recognized that we are unworthy of anything but death; that,
   as we shall shortly see, we are only fit to be crucified anyway. We
   have not recognized that it is God alone that can answer the accuser,
   and that in the precious Blood He has already done so.

   Our salvation lies in looking away to the Lord Jesus and in seeing that
   the Blood of the Lamb has met the whole situation created by our sins
   and has answered it. That is the sure foundation on which we stand.
   Never should we try to answer Satan with our good conduct but always
   with the Blood. Yes, we are sinful, but, praise God! the Blood cleanses
   us from every sin. God looks upon the Blood whereby His Son has met the
   charge, and Satan has no more ground of attack. Our faith in the
   precious Blood and our refusal to be moved from that position can alone
   silence his charges and put him to flight (Romans 8:33, 34); and so it
   will be, right on to the end (Revelation 12:11). Oh, what an
   emancipation it would be if we saw more of the value of God's eyes of
   the precious Blood of His dear Son!

Chapter 2: The Cross of Christ

   We have seen that Romans 1 to 8 falls into two sections, in the first
   of which we are shown that the Blood deals with what we have done,
   while in the second we shall see that the Cross [2] deals with what we
   are. We need the Blood for forgiveness; we need also the Cross for
   deliverance. We have dealt briefly above with the first of these two
   and we shall move on now to the second; but before we do so we will
   look for a moment at a few more features of this passage which serve to
   emphasize the difference in subject matter and argument between the two
   halves.
     __________________________________________________________________

Some Further Distinctions

   Two aspects of the resurrection are mentioned in the two sections, in
   chapters 4 and 6. In Romans 4:25 the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is
   mentioned in relation to our justification: "Jesus our Lord... was
   delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification."
   Here the matter in view is that of our standing before God. But in
   Romans 6:4 the resurrection is spoken of as imparting to us new life
   with a view to a holy walk: "That like as Christ was raised from the
   dead... so we also might walk in newness of life." Here the matter
   before us is behaviour.

   Again, peace is spoken of in both sections, in the fifth and eighth
   chapters. Romans 5 tells of peace with God which is the effect of
   justification by faith in His Blood: "Being therefore justified by
   faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." (5:1 mg.)
   This means that, now that I have forgiveness of sins, God will no
   longer be a cause of dread and trouble to me. I who was an enemy to God
   have been "reconciled... through the death of his Son" (5:10). I very
   soon find, however, that I am going to be a great cause of trouble to
   myself. There is still unrest within, for within me there is something
   that draws me to sin. There is peace with God, but there is no peace
   with myself. There is in fact civil war in my own heart. This condition
   is well depicted in Romans 7 where the flesh and the spirit are seen to
   be in deadly conflict within me. But from this the argument leads in
   chapter 8 to the inward peace of a walk in the Spirit. "The mind of the
   flesh is death", because it "is enmity against God", "but the mind of
   the spirit is life and peace" (Romans 8:6, 7).

   Looking further still we find that the first half of the section deals
   generally speaking with the question of justification (see, for
   example, Romans 3:24-26; 4:5, 25), while the second half has as its
   main topic the corresponding question of sanctification (see Rom. 6:19,
   22). When we know the precious truth of justification by faith we still
   know only half of the story. We still have only solved the problem of
   our standing before God. As we go on, God has something more to offer
   us, namely, the solution of the problem of our conduct, and the
   development of thought in these chapters serves to emphasize this. In
   each case the second step follows from the first, and if we know only
   the first then we are still leading a sub-normal Christian life. How
   then can we live a normal Christian life? How do we enter in? Well, of
   course, initially we must have forgiveness of sins, we must have
   justification, we must have peace with God: these are our indispensable
   foundation. But with that basis truly established through our first act
   of faith in Christ, it is yet clear from the above that we must move on
   to something more.

   So we see that objectively the Blood deals with our sins. The Lord
   Jesus has borne them on the Cross for us as our Substitute and has
   thereby obtained for us forgiveness, justification and reconciliation.
   But we must now go a step further in the plan of God to understand how
   He deals with the sin principle in us. The Blood can wash away my sins,
   but it cannot wash away my old man'. It needs the Cross to crucify me.
   The Blood deals with the sins, but the Cross must deal with the sinner.

   You will scarcely find the word sinner' in the first four chapters of
   Romans. This is because there the sinner himself is not mainly in view,
   but rather the sins he has committed. The word sinner' first comes into
   prominence only in chapter 5, and it is important to notice how the
   sinner is there introduced. In that chapter a sinner is said to be a
   sinner because he is born a sinner; not because he has committed sins.
   The distinction is important. It is true that often when a Gospel
   worker wants to convince a man in the street that he is a sinner, he
   will use the favourite verse Romans 3:23, where it says that "all have
   sinned"; but this use of the verse is not strictly justified by the
   Scriptures. Those who so use it are in danger of arguing the wrong way
   round, for the teaching of Romans is not that we are sinners because we
   commit sins, but that we sin because we are sinners. We are sinners by
   constitution rather than by action. As Romans 5:19 expresses it:
   "Through the one man's disobedience the many were made (or
   constituted') sinners".

   How were we constituted sinners? By Adam's disobedience. We do not
   become sinners by what we have done but because of what Adam has done
   and has become. I speak English, but I am not thereby constituted an
   Englishman. I am in fact a Chinese. So chapter 3 draws our attention to
   what we have done--"all have sinned"--but it is not because we have
   done it that we become sinners.

   I once asked a class of children. Who is a sinner?' and their immediate
   reply was, One who sins'. Yes, one who sins is a sinner, but the fact
   that he sins is merely the evidence that he is already a sinner; it is
   not the cause. One who sins is a sinner, but it is equally true that
   one who does not sin, if he is of Adam's race, is a sinner too, and in
   need of redemption. Do you follow me? There are bad sinners and there
   are good sinners, there are moral sinners and there are corrupt
   sinners, but they are all alike sinners. We sometimes think that if
   only we had not done certain things all would be well; but the trouble
   lies far deeper than in what we do: it lies in what we are. A Chinese
   may be born in America and be unable to speak Chinese at all, but he is
   a Chinese for all that, because he was born a Chinese. It is birth that
   counts. So I am a sinner not of my behaviour but of my heredity, my
   parentage. I am not a sinner because I sin, but I sin because I come of
   the wrong stock. I sin because I am a sinner.

   We are apt to think that what we have done is very bad, but that we
   ourselves are not so bad. God is taking pains to show us that we
   ourselves are wrong, fundamentally wrong. The root trouble is the
   sinner; he must be dealt with. Our sins are dealt with by the Blood,
   but we ourselves are dealt with by the Cross. The Blood procures our
   pardon for what we have done; the Cross procures our deliverance from
   what we are.
     __________________________________________________________________

Man's State By Nature

   We come therefore to Romans 5:12-21. In this great passage, grace is
   brought into contrast with sin and the obedience of Christ is set
   against the disobedience of Adam. It is placed at the beginning of the
   second section of (Romans 5:12 to 8:39) with which we shall now be
   particularly concerned, and its argument leads to a conclusion which
   lies at the foundation of our further meditations. What is that
   conclusion? It is found in verse 19 already quoted: "For as through the
   one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the
   obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous." Here the Spirit
   of God is seeking to show us first what we are, and then how we came to
   be what we are.

   At the beginning of our Christian life we are concerned with our doing,
   not with our being; we are distressed rather by what we have done than
   by what we are. We think that if only we could rectify certain things
   we should be good Christians, and we set out therefore to change our
   actions. But the result is not what we expected. We discover to our
   dismay that it is something more than just a case of trouble on the
   outside--that there is in fact more serious trouble on the inside. We
   try to please the Lord, but find something within that does not want to
   please Him. We try to be humble, but there is something in our very
   being that refuses to be humble. We try to be loving, but inside we
   feel most unloving. We smile and try to look very gracious, but
   inwardly we feel decidedly ungracious. The more we try to rectify
   matters on the outside the more we realize how deep-seated the trouble
   is within. Then we come to the Lord and say, Lord, I see it now! Not
   only what I have done is wrong; I am wrong.'

   The conclusion of Romans 5:19 is beginning to dawn upon us. We are
   sinners. We are members of a race of people who are constitutionally
   other than what God intended them to be. By the Fall a fundamental
   change took place in the character of Adam whereby he became a sinner,
   one constitutionally unable to please God; and the family likeness
   which we all share is no merely superficial one but extends to our
   inward character also. We have been "constituted sinners". How did this
   come about? "By the disobedience of one", says Paul. Let me try to
   illustrate this.

   My name is Nee. It is a fairly common Chinese name. How did I come by
   it? I did not choose it. I did not go through the list of possible
   Chinese names and select this one. That my name is Nee is in fact not
   my doing at all, and, moreover, nothing I can do can alter it. I am a
   Nee because my father was a Nee, and my father was a Nee because my
   grandfather was a Nee. If I act like a Nee I am a Nee, and if I act
   unlike a Nee I am still a Nee. If I become President of the Chinese
   Republic I am a Nee, or if I become a beggar in the street I am still a
   Nee. Nothing I do or refrain from doing will make me other than a Nee.

   We are sinners not because of ourselves but because of Adam. It is not
   because I individually have sinned that I am a sinner but because I was
   in Adam when he sinned. Because by birth I come of Adam, therefore I am
   a part of him. What is more, I can do nothing to alter this. I cannot
   by improving my behaviour make myself other than a part of Adam and so
   a sinner.

   In China I was once talking in this strain and remarked, We have all
   sinned in Adam'. A man said, I don't understand', so I sought to
   explain it in this way. All Chinese trace their descent from Huang-ti',
   I said. Over four thousand years ago he had a war with Si-iu. His enemy
   was very strong, but nevertheless Huang-ti overcame and slew him. After
   this Huang-ti founded the Chinese nation. Four thousand years ago
   therefore our nation was founded by Huang-ti. Now what would have
   happened if Huang-ti had not killed his enemy, but had been himself
   killed instead? Where would you be now?' There would be no me at all',
   he answered. Oh, no! Huang-ti can die his death and you can live your
   life.' Impossible!' he cried, If he had died, then I could never have
   lived, for I have derived my life from him.'

   Do you see the oneness of human life? Our life comes from Adam. If your
   great-grandfather had died at the age of three, where would you be? You
   would have died in him! Your experience is bound up with his. Now in
   just the same way the experience of every one of us is bound up with
   that of Adam. None can say, I have not been in Eden' for potentially we
   all were there when Adam yielded to the serpent's words. So we are all
   involved in Adam's sin, and by being born "in Adam" we receive from him
   all that he became as a result of his sin--that is to say, the
   Adam-nature which is the nature of a sinner. We derive our existence
   from him, and because his life became a sinful life, a sinful nature,
   therefore the nature which we derive from him is also sinful. So, as we
   have said, the trouble is in our heredity, not in our behaviour. Unless
   we can change our parentage there is no deliverance for us.

   But it is in this very direction that we shall find the solution of our
   problem, for that is exactly how God has dealt with the situation.
     __________________________________________________________________

As In Adam So In Christ

   In Romans 5:12 to 21 we are not only told something about Adam; we are
   told also something about the Lord Jesus. "As through the one man's
   disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience
   of the one shall the many be made righteous." In Adam we receive
   everything that is of Adam; in Christ we receive everything that is of
   Christ.

   The terms in Adam' and in Christ' are too little understood by
   Christians, and, at the risk of repetition, I wish again to emphasize
   by means of an illustration the hereditary and racial significance of
   the term in Christ'. This illustration is to be found in the letter to
   the Hebrews. Do you remember that in the earlier part of the letter the
   writer is trying to show that Melchizedek is greater than Levi? You
   recall that the point to be proved is that the priesthood of Christ is
   greater than the priesthood of Aaron who was of the tribe of Levi. Now
   in order to prove that, he has first to prove that the priesthood of
   Melchizedek is greater than the priesthood of Levi, for the simple
   reason that the priesthood of Christ is "after the order of
   Melchizedek" (Heb. 7:14-17), while that of Aaron is, of course, after
   the order of Levi. If the writer can demonstrate to us that Melchizedek
   is greater than Levi, then he has made his point. That is the issue,
   and he proves it in a remarkable way.

   He tells us in Hebrews chapter 7 that one day Abraham, returning from
   the battle of the kings (Genesis 14), offered a tithe of his spoils to
   Melchizedek and received from him a blessing. Inasmuch as Abraham did
   so, Levi is therefore of less account than Melchizedek. Why? Because
   the fact that Abraham offered tithes to Melchizedek. But if that is
   true, then Jacob also in Abraham' offered to Melchizedek, which in turn
   means that Levi in Abraham' offered to Melchizedek. It is evident that
   the lesser offers to the greater (Hebrews 7:7). So Levi is less in
   standing than Melchizedek, and therefore the priesthood of Aaron is
   inferior to that of the Lord Jesus. Levi at the time of the battle of
   the kings was not yet even thought of. Yet he was "in the loins of his
   father" Abraham, and, "so to say, through Abraham", he offered (Hebrews
   7:9, 10).

   Now this is the exact meaning of in Christ'. Abraham, as the head of
   the family of faith, includes the whole family in himself. When he
   offered to Melchizedek, the whole family offered in him to Melchizedek.
   They did not offer separately as individuals, but they were in him, and
   therefore in making his offering he included with himself all his seed.

   So we are presented with a new possibility. In Adam all was lost.
   Through the disobedience of one man we were all constituted sinners. By
   him sin entered and death through sin, and throughout the race sin has
   reigned unto death from that day on. But now a ray of light is cast
   upon the scene. Through the obedience of Another we may be constituted
   righteous. Where sin abounded grace did much more abound, and as sin
   reigned unto death, even so may grace reign through righteousness unto
   eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 5:19-21). Our despair is
   in Adam; our hope is in Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Divine Way of Deliverance

   God clearly intends that this consideration should lead to our
   practical deliverance from sin. Paul makes this quite plain when he
   opens chapter 6 of his letter with the question: "Shall we continue in
   sin?" His whole being recoils at the very suggestion. "God forbid!", he
   exclaims. How could a holy God be satisfied to have unholy,
   sin-fettered children? And so "how shall we any longer live therein?"
   (Romans 6:1, 2). God has surely therefore made adequate provision that
   we should be set free from sin's dominion.

   But here is our problem. We were born sinners; how then can we cut off
   our sinful heredity? Seeing that we were born in Adam, how can we get
   out of Adam? Let me say at once, the Blood cannot take us out of Adam.
   There is only one way. Since we came in by birth we must go out by
   death. To do away with our sinfulness we must do away with our life.
   Bondage to sin came by birth; deliverance from sin comes by death--and
   it is just this way of escape that God has provided. Death is the
   secret of emancipation. "We... died to sin" (Romans 6:2).

   But how can we die? Some of us have tried very hard to get rid of this
   sinful life, but we have found it most tenacious. What is the way out?
   It is not by trying to kill ourselves, but by recognizing that God has
   dealt with us in Christ. This is summed up in the apostle's next
   statement: "All we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized
   into his death" (Romans 6:3).

   But if God has dealt with us in Christ Jesus' then we have got to be in
   Him for this to become effective, and that now seems just as big a
   problem. How are we to get into' Christ? Here again God comes to our
   help. We have in fact no way of getting in, but, what is more
   important, we need not try to get in, for we are in. What we could not
   do for ourselves God has done for us. He has put us into Christ. Let me
   remind you of I Corinthians 1:30. I think that is one of the best
   verses of the whole New Testament: Ye are in Christ'. How? "Of him
   (that is, of God') are ye in Christ." Praise God! it is not left to us
   either to devise a way of entry or to work it out. We need not plan how
   to get in. God has planned it; and He has not only planned it but He
   has also performed it. Of him are ye in Christ Jesus'. We are in;
   therefore we need not try to get in. It is a Divine act, and it is
   accomplished.

   Now if this is true, certain things follow. In the illustration from
   Hebrews 7 which we considered above we saw that in Abraham' all
   Israel--and therefore Levi who was not yet born--offered tithes to
   Melchizedek. They did not offer separately and individually, but they
   were in Abraham when he offered, and his offering included all his
   seed. This, then, is a true figure of ourselves as in Christ'. When the
   Lord Jesus was on the Cross all of us died--not individually, for we
   had not yet been born--but, being in Him, we died in Him. "One died for
   all, therefore all died" (2 Cor. 5:14). When He was crucified all of us
   were crucified.

   Many a time when preaching in the villages of China one has to use very
   simple illustrations for deep Divine truth. I remember once I took up a
   small book and put a piece of paper into it, and I said to those very
   simple ones, Now look carefully. I take a piece of paper. It has an
   identity of its own, quite separate from this book. Having no special
   purpose for it at the moment I put it into the book. Now I do something
   with the book. I post it to Shanghai. I do not post the paper, but the
   paper has been put into the book. Then where is the paper? Can the book
   go to Shanghai and the paper remain here? Can the paper have a separate
   destiny from the book? No! Where the book goes the paper goes. If I
   drop the book in the river the paper goes too, and if I quickly take it
   out again I recover the paper also. Whatever experience the book goes
   through the paper goes through with it, for it is in the book.'

   "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus." The Lord God Himself has put us in
   Christ, and in His dealing with Christ God has dealt with the whole
   race. Our destiny is bound up with His. What He has gone through we
   have gone through, for to be in Christ' is to have been identified with
   Him in both His death and resurrection. He was crucified: then what
   about us? Must we ask God to crucify us? Never! When Christ was
   crucified we were crucified; and His crucifixion is past, therefore
   ours cannot be future. I challenge you to find one text in the New
   Testament telling us that our crucifixion is in the future. All the
   references to it are in the Greek aorist, which is the once-for-all'
   tense, the eternally past' tense. (See: Romans 6:6; Galatians 2:20;
   5:24; 6:14). And just as no man could ever commit suicide by
   crucifixion, for it were a physical impossibility to do so, so also, in
   spiritual terms, God does not require us to crucify ourselves. We were
   crucified when He was crucified, for God put us there in Him. That we
   have died in Christ is not merely a doctrinal position, it is an
   eternal fact.
     __________________________________________________________________

His Death and Resurrection Representative and Inclusive

   The Lord Jesus, when He died on the Cross, shed His Blood, thus giving
   His sinless life to atone for our sin and to satisfy the righteousness
   and holiness of God. To do so was the prerogative of the Son of God
   alone. No man could have a share in that. The Scripture has never told
   us that we shed our blood with Christ. In His atoning work before God
   He acted alone; no other could have a part. But the Lord did not die
   only to shed His Blood: He died that we might die. He died as our
   Representative. In His death He included you and me.

   We often use the terms substitution' and identification' to describe
   these two aspects of the death of Christ. Now many a time the use of
   the word identification' is good. But identification would suggest that
   the thing begins from our side: that I try to identify myself with the
   Lord. I agree that the word is true, but it should be used later on. It
   is better to begin with the fact that the Lord included me in His
   death. It is the inclusive' death of the Lord which puts me in a
   position to identify myself, not that I identify myself in order to be
   included. It is God's inclusion of me in Christ that matters. It is
   something God has done. For that reason those two New Testament words
   "in Christ" are always very dear to my heart.

   The death of the Lord Jesus is inclusive. The resurrection of the Lord
   Jesus is alike inclusive. We have looked at the first chapter of I
   Corinthians to establish the fact that we are "in Christ Jesus". Now we
   will go to the end of the same letter to see something more of what
   this means. In I Corinthians 15:45, 47 two remarkable names or titles
   are used of the Lord Jesus. He is spoken of there as "the last Adam"
   and He is spoken of too as "the second man". Scripture does not refer
   to Him as the second Adam but as "the last Adam"; nor does it refer to
   Him as the last Man, but as "the second man". The distinction is to be
   noted, for it enshrines a truth of great value.

   As the last Adam, Christ is the sum total of humanity; as the second
   Man He is the Head of a new race. So we have here two unions, the one
   relating to His death and the other to His resurrection. In the first
   place His union with the race as "the last Adam" began historically at
   Bethlehem and ended at the cross and the tomb. In it He gathered up
   into Himself all that was in Adam and took it to judgment and death. In
   the second place our union with Him as "the second man" begins in
   resurrection and ends in eternity--which is to say, it never ends--for,
   having in His death done away with the first man in whom God's purpose
   was frustrated, He rose again as Head of a new race of men, in whom
   that purpose shall be fully realized.

   When therefore the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was
   crucified as the last Adam. All that was in the first Adam was gathered
   up and done away in Him. We were included there. As the last Adam He
   wiped out the old race; as the second Man He brings in the new race. It
   is in His resurrection that He stands forth as the second Man, and
   there too we are included. "For if we have become united with him by
   the likeness of his death, we shall be also by the likeness of his
   resurrection" (Romans 6:5). We died in Him as the last Adam; we live in
   Him as the second Man. The Cross is thus the power of God which
   translates us from Adam to Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] Note - The author uses the Cross' here and throughout these studies
   in a special sense. Most readers will be familiar with the current use
   of the expression the Cross' to signify, firstly, the entire redemptive
   work accomplished historically in the death, burial, resurrection and
   ascension of the Lord Jesus Himself (Phil. 2:8, 9), and secondly, in a
   wider sense, the union of believers with Him therein through grace
   (Rom. 6:4; Eph. 2:5, 6). Clearly in that use of the term the operation
   of the Blood' in relation to forgiveness of sins (as dealt with in
   Chapter 1 of this book) is, from God's viewpoint, included (with all
   that follows in these studies) as a part of the work of the Cross. In
   this and the following chapters, however, the author is compelled, for
   lack of an alternative term, to use the Cross' in a more particular and
   limited doctrinal sense in order to draw a helpful distinction, namely,
   that between substitution and identification, as being, from the human
   angle, two separate aspects of the doctrine of redemption. Thus the
   name of the whole is of necessity used for one of its parts. The reader
   should bear this in mind in what follows.--Ed.

Chapter 3: The Path of Progress: Knowing

   Our old history ends with the Cross; our new history begins with the
   resurrection. "If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old
   things are passed away; behold they are become new" (2 Cor. 5:17). The
   Cross terminates the first creation, and out of death there is brought
   a new creation in Christ, the second Man. If we are in Adam' all that
   is in Adam necessarily devolves upon us; it becomes ours involuntarily,
   for we have to do nothing to get it. There is no need to make up our
   minds to lose our temper or to commit some other sin; it comes to us
   freely and despite ourselves. In a similar way, if we are in Christ'
   all that is in Christ comes to us by free grace, without effort on our
   part but on the ground of simple faith.

   But to say that all we need comes to us in Christ by free grace, though
   true enough, may seem unpractical. How does it work out in practice?
   How does it become real in our experience?

   As we study chapters 6, 7 and 8 of Romans we shall discover that the
   conditions of living the normal Christian life are fourfold. They are:
   (a) Knowing, (b) Reckoning, (c) Presenting ourselves to God, and (d)
   Walking in the Spirit, and they are set forth in that order. If we
   would live that life we shall have to take all four of these steps; not
   one nor two nor three, but all four. As we study each of them we shall
   trust the Lord by His Holy Spirit to illumine our understanding; and we
   shall seek His help now to take the first big step forward.

Our Death With Christ A Historic Fact

   Romans 6:1-11 is the passage before us now. In these verses it is made
   clear that the death of the Lord Jesus is representative and inclusive.
   In His death we all died. None of us can progress spiritually without
   seeing this. Just as we cannot have justification if we have not seen
   Him bearing our sins on the Cross, so we cannot have sanctification if
   we have not seen Him bearing us on the Cross. Not only have our sins
   been laid on Him but we ourselves have been put into Him.

   How did you receive forgiveness? You realized that the Lord Jesus died
   as your Substitute and bore your sins upon Himself, and that His Blood
   was shed to cleanse away your defilement. When you saw your sins all
   taken away on the Cross what did you do? Did you say, Lord Jesus,
   please come and die for my sins'? No, you did not pray at all; you only
   thanked the Lord You did not beseech Him to come and die for you, for
   you realized that He had already done it.

   But what is true of your forgiveness is also true of your deliverance.
   The work is done. There is no need to pray but only to praise. God has
   put us all in Christ, so that when Christ was crucified we were
   crucified also. Thus there is no need to pray: I am a very wicked
   person; Lord, please crucify me'. That is all wrong. You did not pray
   about your sins; why pray now about yourself? Your sins were dealt with
   by His Blood, and you were dealt with by His Cross. It is an
   accomplished fact. All that is left for you to do is to praise the Lord
   that when Christ died you died also; you died in Him. Praise Him for it
   and live in the light of it. "Then believed they his words: they sang
   his praise" (Psalm 106:12).

   Do you believe in the death of Christ? Of course you do. Well, the same
   Scripture that says He died for us says also that we died with Him.
   Look at it again: "Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). That is the first
   statement, and that is clear enough; but is this any less clear? "Our
   old man was crucified with him" (Romans 6:6). "We died with Christ"
   (Romans 6:8).

   When are we crucified with Him? What is the date of our old man's
   crucifixion? Is it tomorrow? Yesterday? Today? In order to answer this
   it may help us if for a moment I turn Paul's statement round and say,
   Christ was crucified with (i.e. at the same time as) our old man'. Some
   of you came here in twos. You traveled to this place together. You
   might say, My friend came here with me', but you might just as truly
   say, I came here with my friend'. Had one of you come three days ago
   and the other only today you could not possibly say that; but having
   come together you can make either statement with equal truth, because
   both are statements of fact. So also in historic fact we can say,
   reverently but with equal accuracy, I was crucified when Christ was
   crucified' or Christ was crucified when I was crucified', for they are
   not two historical events, but one. My crucifixion was "with him". [3]
   Has Christ been crucified? Then can I be otherwise? And if He was
   crucified nearly two thousand years ago, and I with Him, can my
   crucifixion be said to take place tomorrow? Can His be past and mine be
   present or future? Praise the Lord, when He died in my stead, but He
   bore me with Him to the Cross, so that when He died I died. And if I
   believe in the death of the Lord Jesus, then I can believe in my own
   death just as surely as I believe in His.

   Why do you believe that the Lord Jesus died? What is your ground for
   that belief? Is it that you feel He has died? No, you have never felt
   it. You believe it because the Word of God tells you so. When the Lord
   was crucified, two thieves were crucified at the same time. You do not
   doubt that they were crucified with Him, either, because the Scripture
   says so quite plainly.

   You believe in the death of the Lord Jesus and you believe in the death
   of the thieves with Him. Now what about your own death? Your
   crucifixion is more intimate than theirs. They were crucified at the
   same time as the Lord but on different crosses, whereas you were
   crucified on the self same cross as He, for you were in Him when He
   died. How can you know? You can know for the one sufficient reason that
   God has said so. It does not depend on your feelings. If you feel that
   Christ has died, He has died; and if you do not feel that he died, He
   has died. If you feel that you have died, you have died; and if you do
   not feel that you have died, you have nevertheless just as surely died.
   These are Divine facts. That Christ has died is a fact, that the two
   thieves have died is a fact, and that you have died is a fact also. Let
   me tell you, You have died! You are done with! You are ruled out! The
   self you loathe is on the Cross in Christ. And "he that is dead is
   freed from sin" (Romans 6:7, A.V.). This is the Gospel for Christians.

   Our crucifixion can never be made effective by will or by effort, but
   only by accepting what the Lord Jesus did on the Cross. Our eyes must
   be opened to see the finished work of Calvary. Some of you, prior to
   your salvation, may have tried to save yourselves. You read the Bible,
   prayed, went to Church, gave alms. Then one day your eyes were opened
   and you saw that a full salvation had already been provided for you on
   the Cross. You just accepted that and thanked God, and peace and joy
   flowed into your heart. Now salvation and sanctification are on exactly
   the same basis. You receive deliverance from sin in the same way as you
   receive forgiveness of sins.

   For God's way of deliverance is altogether different from man's way.
   Man's way is to try to suppress sin by seeking to overcome it; God's
   way is to remove the sinner. Many Christians mourn over their weakness,
   thinking that if only they were stronger all would be well. The idea
   that, because failure to lead a holy life is due to our impotence,
   something more is therefore demanded of us, leads naturally to this
   false conception of the way of deliverance. If we are preoccupied with
   the power of sin and with our inability to meet it, then we naturally
   conclude that to gain the victory over sin we must have more power. If
   only I were stronger', we say, I could overcome my violent outbursts of
   temper', and so we plead with the Lord to strengthen us that we may
   exercise more self-control.

   But this is altogether wrong; this is not Christianity. God's means of
   delivering us from sin is not by making us stronger and stronger, but
   by making us weaker and weaker. That is surely rather a peculiar way of
   victory, you say; but it is the Divine way. God sets us free from the
   dominion of sin, not by strengthening our old man but by crucifying
   him; not by helping him to do anything but by removing him from the
   scene of action.

   For years, maybe, you have tried fruitlessly to exercise control over
   yourself, and perhaps this is still your experience; but when once you
   see the truth you will recognize that you are indeed powerless to do
   anything, but that in setting you aside altogether God has done it all.
   Such a revelation brings human self-effort to an end.
     __________________________________________________________________

   doctrinal as well as historical, or temporal sense. It is only in the
   historical sense that the statement is reversible. W.N.
     __________________________________________________________________

The First Step: "Knowing This..."

   The normal Christian life must begin with a very definite knowing',
   which is not just knowing something about the truth nor understanding
   some important doctrine. It is not intellectual knowledge at all, but
   an opening of the eyes of the heart to see what we have in Christ.

   How do you know your sins are forgiven? Is it because your pastor told
   you so? No, you just know it. If I ask you how you know, you simply
   answer, I know it!' Such knowledge comes by Divine revelation. It comes
   from the Lord Himself. Of course the fact of forgiveness of sins is in
   the Bible, but for the written Word of God to become a living Word from
   God to you He had to give you "a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
   knowledge of him" (Eph. 1:17). What you needed was to know Christ in
   that way, and it is always so. So there comes a time, in regard to any
   new apprehension of Christ, when you know it in your own heart, you
   see' it in your spirit. A light has shined into your inner being and
   you are wholly persuaded of the fact. What is true of the forgiveness
   of your sins is no less true of your deliverance from sin. When once
   the light of God dawns upon your heart you see yourself in Christ. It
   is not now because someone has told you, and not merely because Romans
   6 says so. It is something more even than that. You know it because God
   has revealed it to you by His Spirit. You may not feel it; you may not
   understand it; but you know it, for you have seen it. Once you have
   seen yourself in Christ, nothing can shake your assurance of that
   blessed fact.

   If you ask a number of believers who have entered upon the normal
   Christian life how they came by their experience, some will say in this
   way and some will say in that. Each stresses his own particular way of
   entering in and produces Scripture to support his experience; and
   unhappily many Christians are using their special experiences and their
   special scriptures to fight other Christians. The fact of the matter is
   that, while Christians may enter into the deeper life by different
   ways, we need not regard the experiences or doctrines they stress as
   mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. One thing is certain,
   that any true experience of value in the sight of God must have been
   reached by way of a new discovery of the meaning of the Person and work
   of the Lord Jesus. That is a crucial test and a safe one.

   And here in our passage Paul makes everything depend upon such a
   discovery. "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that
   the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in
   bondage to sin" (Romans 6:6).
     __________________________________________________________________

Divine Revelation Essential To Knowledge

   So our first step is to seek from God a knowledge that comes by
   revelation--a revelation, that is to say, not of ourselves but of the
   finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross. When Hudson
   Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, entered into the
   normal Christian life it was thus that he did so. You remember how he
   tells of his long-standing problem of how to live in Christ', how to
   draw the sap out of the Vine into himself. For he knew that he must
   have the life of Christ flowing out through him and yet felt that he
   had not got it, and he saw clearly enough that his need was to be found
   in Christ. I knew', he said, writing to his sister from Chinkiang in
   1869, that if only I could abide in Christ, all would be well, but I
   could not.'

   The more he tried to get in the more he found himself slipping out, so
   to speak, until one day light dawned, revelation came and he saw. Here,
   I feel, is the secret: not asking how I am to get sap out of the Vine
   into myself, but remembering that Jesus is the Vine--the root, stem,
   branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruit, all indeed.'

   Then, in words of a friend that had helped him: I have not got to make
   myself a branch. The Lord Jesus tells me I am a branch. I am part of
   Him and I have just to believe it and act upon it. I have seen it long
   enough in the Bible, but I believe it now as a living reality.'

   It was as though something which had indeed been true all the time had
   now suddenly become true in a new way to him personally, and he writes
   to his sister again: I do not know how far I may be able to make myself
   intelligible about it, for there is nothing new or strange or
   wonderful--and yet, all is new! In a word, "whereas once I was blind,
   now I see"... I am dead and buried with Christ--aye, and risen too and
   ascended... God reckons me so, and tells me to reckon myself so. He
   knows best... Oh, the joy of seeing this truth--I do pray that the eyes
   of your understanding may be enlightened, that you may know and enjoy
   the riches freely given us in Christ.' [4]

   Oh, it is a great thing to see that we are in Christ! Think of the
   bewilderment of trying to get into a room in which you already are!
   Think of the absurdity of asking to be put in! If we recognize the fact
   that we are in, we make no effort to enter. If we had more revelation
   we should have fewer prayers and more praises. Much of our praying for
   ourselves is just because we are blind to what God has done.

   I remember one day in Shanghai I was talking with a brother who was
   very exercised concerning his spiritual state. He said, So many are
   living beautiful, saintly lives. I am ashamed of myself. I call myself
   a Christian and yet when I compare myself with others I feel I am not
   one at all. I want to know this crucified life, this resurrection life,
   but I do not know it and see no way of getting there.' Another brother
   was with us, and the two of us had been talking for two hours or so,
   trying to get the man to see that he could not have anything apart from
   Christ, but without success. Said our friend, the best thing a man can
   do is to pray.' But if God has already given you everything, what do
   you need to pray for?' we asked. He hasn't', the man replied, for I am
   still losing my temper, still failing constantly; so I must pray more.'
   Well', we said, do you get what you pray for?' I am sorry to say that I
   do not get anything', he replied. We tried to point out that, just as
   he had done nothing for his justification, so he need do nothing for
   his sanctification.

   Just then a third brother, much used of the Lord, came in and joined
   us. There was a thermos flask on the table, and this brother picked it
   up and said, What is this?' A thermos flask.' Well, you just imagine
   for a moment that this thermos flask can pray, and that it starts
   praying something like this: "Lord, I want very much to be a thermos
   flask. Wilt Thou make me to be a thermos flask? Lord, give me grace to
   become a thermos flask. Do please make me one!" What will you say?' I
   do not think even a thermos flask would be so silly,' our friend
   replied. It would be nonsense to pray like that; it is a thermos
   flask!' Then my brother said, You are doing the same thing. God in
   times past has already included you in Christ. When He died, you died;
   when He lived, you lived. Now today you cannot say, "I want to die; I
   want to be crucified; I want to have resurrection life." The Lord
   simply looks at you and says, "You are dead! You have new life!" All
   your praying is just as absurd as that of the thermos flask. You do not
   need to pray to the Lord for anything; you merely need your eyes opened
   to see that He has done it all.'

   That is the point. We need not work to die, we need not wait to die, we
   are dead. We only need to recognize what the Lord has already done and
   to praise Him for it. Light dawned for that man. With tears in his eyes
   he said, Lord, I praise Thee that Thou hast already included me in
   Christ. All that is His is mine!' Revelation had come and faith had
   something to lay hold of; and if you could have met that brother later
   on, what a change you would have found!

The Cross Goes To The Root Of Our Problem

   Let me remind you again of the fundamental nature of that which the
   Lord has done on the Cross. I feel I cannot press this point too much
   for we must see it. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the
   government of your country should wish to deal drastically with the
   question of strong drink and should decide that the whole country was
   to go dry', how could the decision be carried into effect? How could we
   help? If we were to search every shop and house throughout the land and
   smash all the bottles of wine or beer or brandy we came across, would
   that meet the case? Surely not. We might thereby rid the land of every
   drop of alcoholic liquor it contains, but behind those bottles of
   strong drink are the factories that produce them, and if we only deal
   with the bottles and leave the factories untouched, production will
   still continue and there is no permanent solution of the problem. The
   drink-producing factories, the breweries and distilleries throughout
   the land, must be closed down if the drink question is to be
   permanently settled.

   We are the factory; our actions are the products. The Blood of the Lord
   Jesus dealt with the question of the products, namely, our sins. So the
   question of what we have done is settled, but would God have stopped
   there? What about the question of what we are? Our sins were produced
   by us. They have been dealt with, but how are we going to be dealt
   with? Do you believe the Lord would cleanse away all our sins and then
   leave us to get rid of the sin-producing factory? Do you believe He
   would put away the goods produced but leave us to deal with the source
   of production?

   To ask this question is but to answer it. Of course He has not done
   half the work and left the other half undone. No, He has done away with
   the goods and also made a clean sweep of the factory that produces the
   goods.

   The finished work of Christ really has gone to the root of our problem
   and dealt with it. There are no half measures with God. "Knowing this,"
   says Paul, "That our old man was crucified with him, that the body of
   sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to
   sin" (Rom. 6:6). "Knowing this"! Yes, but do you know it? "Or are ye
   ignorant?" (Rom. 6:3). May the Lord graciously open our eyes.

Chapter 4: The Path of Progress: Reckoning

   We now come to a matter on which there has been some confusion of
   thought among the Lord's children. It concerns what follows this
   knowledge. Note again first of all the wording of Romans 6:6: "Knowing
   this, that our old man was crucified with Him". The tense of the verb
   is most precious for it puts the event right back there in the past. It
   is final, once-for-all. The thing has been done and cannot be undone.
   Our old man has been crucified once and for ever, and he can never be
   un-crucified. This is what we need to know.

   Then, when we know this, what follows? Look again at our passage. The
   next command is in verse 11: "Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be
   dead unto sin". This, clearly, is the natural sequel to verse 6. Read
   them together: Knowing that our old man was crucified, ... reckon ye
   yourselves to be dead'. That is the order. When we know that our old
   man has been crucified with Christ, then the next step is to reckon it
   so.

   Unfortunately, in presenting the truth of our union with Christ the
   emphasis has too often been placed upon this second matter of reckoning
   ourselves to be dead, as though that were the starting point, whereas
   it should rather be upon knowing ourselves to be dead. God's Word makes
   it clear that knowing' is to precede reckoning'. "Knowing this...
   reckon." The sequence is most important. Our reckoning must be based on
   knowledge of divinely revealed fact, for otherwise faith has no
   foundation on which to rest. When we know, then we reckon
   spontaneously.

   So in teaching this matter we should not over-emphasize reckoning.
   People are always trying to reckon without knowing. They have not first
   had a Spirit-given revelation of the fact; yet they try to reckon and
   soon they get into all sorts of difficulties. When temptation comes
   they begin to reckon furiously: I am dead; I am dead; I am dead!' but
   in the very act of reckoning they lose their temper. Then they say, It
   doesn't work. Romans 6:11 is no good.' And we have to admit that verse
   11 is no good without verse 6. So it comes to this, that unless we know
   for a fact that we are dead with Christ, the more we reckon the more
   intense will the struggle become, and the issue will be sure defeat.

   For years after my conversion I had been taught to reckon. I reckoned
   from 1920 until 1927. The more I reckoned that I was dead to sin, the
   more alive I clearly was. I simply could not believe myself dead and I
   could not produce the death. Whenever I sought help from others I was
   told to read Romans 6:11, and the more I read Romans 6:11 and tried to
   reckon, the further away death was: I could not get at it. I fully
   appreciated the teaching that I must reckon, but I could not make out
   why nothing resulted from it. I have to confess that for months I was
   troubled. I said to the Lord, If this is not clear, if I cannot be
   brought to see this which is so very fundamental, I will cease to do
   anything. I will not preach any more; I will not go out to serve Thee
   any more; I want first of all to get thoroughly clear here.' For months
   I was seeking, and at times I fasted, but nothing came through.

   I remember one morning--that morning was a real morning and one I can
   never forget--I was upstairs sitting at my desk reading the Word and
   praying, and I said, Lord, open my eyes!' And then in a flash I saw it.
   I saw my oneness with Christ. I saw that I was in Him, and that when He
   died I died. I saw that the question of my death was a matter of the
   past and not of the future, and that I was just as truly dead as He was
   because I was in Him when He died. The whole thing had dawned upon me.
   I was carried away with such joy at this great discovery that I jumped
   from my chair and cried, Praise the Lord, I am dead!' I ran downstairs
   and met one of the brothers helping in the kitchen and I laid hold of
   him. Brother', I said, do you know that I have died?' I must admit he
   looked puzzled. What do you mean?' he said, so I went on: Do you not
   know that Christ has died? Do you not know that I died with Him? Do you
   not know that my death is no less truly a fact than His?' Oh it was so
   real to me! I longed to go through the streets of Shanghai shouting the
   news of my discovery. From that day to this I have never for one moment
   doubted the finality of that word: "I have been crucified with Christ".

   I do not mean to say that we need not work that out. Yes, there is an
   outworking of the death which we are going to see presently, but this,
   first of all, is the basis of it. I have been crucified: it has been
   done.

   What, then, is the secret of reckoning? To put it in one word, it is
   revelation. We need revelation from God Himself (Matt. 16:17; Eph.
   1:17, 18). We need to have our eyes opened to the fact of our union
   with Christ, and that is something more than knowing it as a doctrine.
   Such revelation is no vague, indefinite thing. Most of us can remember
   the day when we saw clearly that Christ died for us, and we ought to be
   equally clear as to the time when we saw that we died with Christ. It
   should be nothing hazy, but very definite, for it is with this as basis
   that we shall go on. It is not that I reckon myself to be dead, and
   therefore I will be dead. It is that, because I am dead--because I see
   now what God has done with me in Christ--therefore I reckon myself to
   be dead. That is the right kind of reckoning. It is not reckoning
   toward death but from death.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Second Step: "Even So Reckon..."

   What does reckoning mean? Reckoning' in Greek means doing accounts
   book-keeping. Accounting is the only thing in the world we human beings
   can do correctly. An artist paints a landscape. Can he do it with
   perfect accuracy? Can the historian vouch for the absolute accuracy of
   any record, or the map-maker for the perfect correctness of any map?
   They can make, at best, fair approximations. Even in everyday speech,
   when we try to tell some incident with the best intention to be honest
   and truthful, we cannot speak with complete accuracy. It is mostly a
   case of exaggeration or understatement, of one word too much or too
   little. What then can a man do that is utterly reliable? Arithmetic!
   There is no scope for error there. One chair plus one chair equals two
   chairs. That is true in London and it is true in Cape Town. If you
   travel west to New York or east to Singapore it is still the same. All
   the world over and for all time, one plus one equals two. One plus one
   is two in heaven and earth and hell.

   Why does God say we are to reckon ourselves dead? Because we are dead.
   Let us keep to the analogy of accounting. Suppose I have fifteen
   shillings in my pocket, what do I enter in my account-book? Can I enter
   fourteen shillings and sixpence or fifteen shillings and sixpence? No,
   I must enter in my account-book that which is in fact in my pocket.
   Accounting is the reckoning of facts, not fancies. Even so, it is
   because I am really dead that God tells me to account it so. God could
   not ask me to put down in my account-book what was not true. He could
   not ask me to reckon that I am dead if I am still alive. For such
   mental gymnastics the word reckoning' would be inappropriate; we might
   rather speak of mis-reckoning'!

   Reckoning is not a form of make-believe. It does not mean that, having
   found that I have only twelve shillings in my pocket, I hope that by
   entering fifteen shillings incorrectly in my account-book such
   reckoning' will somehow remedy the deficiency. It won't. If I have only
   twelve shillings, yet try to reckon to myself: I have fifteen
   shillings; I have fifteen shillings; I have fifteen shillings', do you
   think that the mental effort involved will in any way affect the sum
   that is in my pocket? Not a bit of it! Reckoning will not make twelve
   shillings into fifteen shillings, nor will it make what is untrue true.
   But if, on the other hand, it is a fact that I have fifteen shillings
   in my pocket, then with great ease and assurance I can enter fifteen
   shillings in my account-book. God tells us to reckon ourselves dead,
   not that by the process of reckoning we may become dead, but because we
   are dead. He never told us to reckon what was not a fact.

   Having said, then, that revelation leads spontaneously to reckoning, we
   must not lose sight of the fact that we are presented with a command:
   "Reckon ye..." There is a definite attitude to be taken. God asks us to
   do the account; to put down I have died' and then to abide by it. Why?
   Because it is a fact. When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, I was there
   in Him. Therefore I reckon it to be true. I reckon and declare that I
   have died in Him. Paul said, "Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto
   sin, but alive unto God." How is this possible? "In Christ Jesus."
   Never forget that it is always and only true in Christ. If you look at
   yourself you will think death is not there, but it is a question of
   faith not in yourself but in Him. You look to the Lord, and know what
   He has done. Lord, I believe in Thee. I reckon upon the fact in Thee.'
   Stand there all the day.

The Reckoning Of Faith

   The first four-and-a-half chapters of Romans speak of faith and faith
   and faith. We are justified by faith in Him (Rom. 3:28; 5:1).
   Righteousness, the forgiveness of our sins, and peace with God are all
   ours by faith, and without faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ
   none can possess them. But in the second section of Romans we do not
   find the same repeated mention of faith, and it might at first appear
   that the emphasis is therefore different. It is not really so, however,
   for where the words faith' and believe' drop out the work reckon' takes
   their place. Reckoning and faith are here practically the same thing.

   What is faith? Faith is my acceptance of God's fact. It always has its
   foundations in the past. What relates to the future is hope rather than
   faith, although faith often has its object or goal in the future, as in
   Hebrews 11. Perhaps for this reason the word chosen here is reckon'. It
   is a word that relates only to the past--to what we look back to as
   settled, and not forward to as yet to be. This is the kind of faith
   described in Mark 11:24: "All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for,
   believe that ye have received them, and ye shall have them." The
   statement there is that, if you believe that you already have received
   your requests (that is, of course, in Christ), then you shall have
   them'. To believe that you may get something, or that you can get it,
   or even that you will get it, is not faith in the sense meant here.
   This is faith--to believe that you have already got it. Only that which
   relates to the past is faith in this sense. Those who say God can' or
   God may' or God must' or God will' do not necessarily believe at all.
   Faith always says, God has done it'.

   When, therefore, do I have faith in regard to my crucifixion? Not when
   I say God can, or will, or must crucify me, but when with joy I say,
   Praise God, in Christ I am crucified!'

   In Romans 3 we see the Lord Jesus bearing our sins and dying as our
   Substitute that we might be forgiven. In Romans 6 we see ourselves
   included in the death whereby He secured our deliverance. When the
   first fact was revealed to us we believed on Him for our justification.
   God tells us to reckon upon the second fact for our deliverance. So
   that, for practical purposes, reckoning' in the second section of
   Romans takes the place of faith' in the first section. The emphasis is
   not different. The normal Christian life is lived progressively, as it
   is entered initially, by faith in Divine fact: in Christ and His Cross.
     __________________________________________________________________

Temptation And Failure, The Challenge To Faith

   For us, then, the two greatest facts in history are these: that all our
   sins are dealt with by the Blood, and that we ourselves are dealt with
   by the Cross. But what now of the matter of temptation? What is to be
   our attitude when, after we have seen and believed these facts, we
   discover the old desires rising up again? Worse still, what if we fall
   once more into known sin? What if we lose our temper, or worse? Is the
   whole position set forth above proved thereby to be false?

   Now remember, one of the Devil's main objects is always to make us
   doubt the Divine facts. (Compare Gen. 3:4) After we have seen, by
   revelation of the Spirit of God, that we are indeed dead with Christ,
   and have reckoned it so, he will come and say: There is something
   moving inside. What about it? Can you call this death?' When that
   happens, what will be our answer? The crucial test is just here. Are
   you going to believe the tangible facts of the natural realm which are
   clearly before your eyes, or the intangible facts of the spiritual
   realm which are neither seen nor scientifically proved?

   Now we must be careful. It is important for us to recall again what are
   facts stated in God's Word for faith to lay hold of and what are not.
   How does God state that deliverance is effected? Well, in the first
   place, we are not told that sin as a principle in us is rooted out or
   removed. To reckon on that will be to miscalculate altogether and find
   ourselves in the false position of the man we considered earlier, who
   tried to put down the twelve shillings in his pocket as fifteen
   shillings in his account-book. No, sin is not eradicated. It is very
   much there, and, given the opportunity, will overpower us and cause us
   to commit sins again, whether consciously or unconsciously. That is why
   we shall always need to know the operation of the precious Blood.

   But whereas we know that, in dealing with sins committed, God's method
   is direct, to blot them out of remembrance by means of the Blood, when
   we come to the principle of sin and the matter of deliverance from its
   power, we find instead that God deals with this indirectly. He does not
   remove the sin but the sinner. Our old man was crucified with Him, and
   because of this the body, which before had been a vehicle of sin, is
   unemployed (Romans 6:6). [5] Sin, the old master, is still about, but
   the slave who served him has been put to death and so is out of reach
   and his members are unemployed. The gambler's hand is unemployed, the
   swearer's tongue is unemployed, and these members are now available to
   be used instead "as instruments of righteousness unto God" (Romans
   6:13).

   Thus we can say that deliverance from sin' is a more scriptural idea
   than victory over sin'. The expressions "freed from sin" and "dead unto
   sin" in Romans 6:7 and 11 imply deliverance from a power that is still
   very present and very real--not from something that no longer exists.
   Sin is still there, but we are knowing deliverance from its power in
   increasing measure day by day.

   This deliverance is so real that John can boldly write: "Whosoever is
   begotten of God doeth no sin... he cannot sin" (1 John 3:9), which is,
   however, a statement that, wrongly understood, may easily mislead us.
   By it John is not telling us that sin is now no longer in our history
   and that we shall not again commit sin. He is saying that to sin is not
   in the nature of that which is born of God. The life of Christ has been
   planted in us by new birth and its nature is not to commit sin. But
   there is a great difference between the nature and the history of a
   thing, and there is a great difference between the nature of the life
   within us and our history. To illustrate this (though the illustration
   is an inadequate one) we might say that wood cannot' sink, for it is
   not its nature to do so; but of course in history it will do so if a
   hand hold it under water. The history is a fact, just as sins in our
   history are historic facts; but the nature is a fact also, and so is
   the new nature that we have received in Christ. What is in Christ'
   cannot sin; what is in Adam can sin and will do so whenever Satan is
   given a chance to exert his power.

   So it is a question of our choice of which facts we will count upon and
   live by: the tangible facts of daily experience or the mightier fact
   that we are now in Christ'. The power of His resurrection is on our
   side, and the whole might of God is at work in our salvation (Rom.
   1:16), but the matter still rests upon our making real in history what
   is true in Divine fact.

   "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the proving of things
   not seen" (Heb. 11:1), and "the things which are not seen are eternal"
   (2 Cor. 4:18). I think we all know that Hebrews 11:1 is the only
   definition of faith in the New Testament, or indeed in the Scriptures.
   It is important that we should really understand that definition. You
   are familiar with the common English translation of these words,
   describing faith as "the substance of things hoped for" (A.V.).
   However, the word in the Greek has in it the sense of an action and not
   just of some thing, a substance', and I confess I have personally spent
   a number of years trying to find a correct word to translate this. But
   the New Translation of J.N. Darby is especially good in regard to this
   word: "Faith is the substantiating of things hoped for". That is much
   better. It implies the making of them real in experience.

   How do we substantiate' something? We are doing so every day. We cannot
   live in the world without doing so. Do you know the difference between
   substance and substantiating'? A substance is an object, something
   before me. Substantiating' means that I have a certain power or faculty
   that makes that substance to be real to me. Let us take a simple
   illustration. By means of our senses we can take things of the world of
   nature and transfer them into our consciousness so that we can
   appreciate them. Sight and hearing, for example, are two of my
   faculties which substantiate to me the world of light and sound. We
   have colours: red, yellow, green, blue, violet; and these colours are
   real things. But if I shut my eyes, then to me the colour is no longer
   real; it is simply nothing-- to me. It is not only that the colour is
   there, but I have the power to substantiate' it. I have the power to
   make that colour true to me and to give it reality in my consciousness.
   That is the meaning of substantiating'.

   If I am blind I cannot distinguish colour, or if I lack the faculty of
   hearing I cannot enjoy music. Yet music and colour are in fact real
   things, and their reality is unaffected by whether or not I am able to
   appreciate them. Now we are considering here the things which, though
   they are not seen, are eternal and therefore real. Of course we cannot
   substantiate Divine things with any of our natural senses; but there is
   one faculty which can substantiate the "things hoped for", the things
   of Christ, and that is faith. Faith makes the real things to become
   real in my experience. Faith substantiates' to me the things of Christ.
   Hundreds of thousands of people are reading Romans 6:6: "Our old man
   was crucified with him". To faith it is true; to doubt, or to mere
   mental assent apart from spiritual illumination, it is not true.

   Let us remember again that we are dealing here not with promises but
   with facts. The promises of God are revealed to us by His Spirit that
   we may lay hold of them; but facts are facts and they remain facts
   whether we believe them or not. If we do not believe the facts of the
   Cross they still remain as real as ever, but they are valueless to us.
   It does not need faith to make these things real in themselves, but
   faith can substantiate' them and make them real in our experience.

   Whatever contradicts the truth of God's Word we are to regard as the
   Devil's lie, not because it may not be in itself a very real fact to
   our senses but because God has stated a greater fact before which the
   other must eventually yield. I once had an experience which (though not
   applicable in detail to the present matter) illustrates this principle.
   Some years ago I was ill. For six nights I had high fever and could
   find no sleep. Then at length God gave me from the Scripture a personal
   word of healing, and because of this I expected all symptoms of
   sickness to vanish at once. Instead of that, not a wink of sleep could
   I get, and I was not only sleepless but more restless than ever. My
   temperature rose higher, my pulse beat faster and my head ached more
   severely than before. The enemy asked, Where is God's promise? Where is
   your faith? What about all your prayers?' So I was tempted to thrash
   the whole matter out in prayer again, but was rebuked, and this
   Scripture came to mind: "Thy word is truth" (John 17:17). If God' Word
   is truth, I thought, then what are these symptoms? They must all be
   lies! So I declared to the enemy, This sleeplessness is a lie, this
   headache is a lie, this fever is a lie, this high pulse is a lie. In
   view of what God has said to me, all these symptoms of sickness are
   just your lies, and God's Word to me is truth.' In five minutes I was
   asleep, and I awoke the following morning perfectly well.

   Now of course in a particular personal matter such as the above it
   might be quite possible for me to deceive myself as to what God had
   said, but of the fact of the Cross there can never be any such
   question. We must believe God, no matter how convincing Satan's
   arguments appear.

   A skillful liar lies not only in word but in gesture and deed; he can
   as easily pass a bad coin as tell an untruth. The Devil is a skillful
   liar, and we cannot expect him to stop at words in his lying. He will
   resort to lying signs and feelings and experiences in his attempts to
   shake us from our faith in God's Word. Let me make it clear that I do
   not deny the reality of the flesh'. Indeed we shall have a good deal
   more to say about this further on in our study. But I am speaking here
   of our being moved from a revealed position in Christ. As soon as we
   have accepted our death with Christ as a fact, Satan will do his best
   to demonstrate convincingly by the evidence of our day-to-day
   experience that we are not dead at all but very much alive. So we must
   choose. Will we believe Satan's lie or God's truth? Are we going to be
   governed by appearances or by what God says?

   I am Mr. Nee. I know that I am Mr. Nee. It is a fact upon which I can
   confidently count. It is of course possible that I might lose my memory
   and forget that I am Mr. Nee, or I might dream that I am some other
   person. But whether I feel like it or not, when I am sleeping I am Mr.
   Nee and when I am awake I am Mr. Nee; when I remember it I am Mr. Nee
   and when I forget it I am still Mr. Nee.

   Now of course, were I to pretend to be someone else, things would be
   much more difficult. If I were to try and pose as Miss K. I should have
   to keep saying to myself all the time, You are Miss K.; now be sure to
   remember that you are Miss K.,' and despite much reckoning the
   likelihood would be that when I was off my guard and someone called,
   Mr. Nee!' I should be caught out and should answer to my own name. Fact
   would triumph over fiction, and all my reckoning would break down at
   that crucial moment. But I am Mr. Nee and therefore I have no
   difficulty whatever in reckoning myself to be Mr. Nee. It is a fact
   which nothing I experience or fail to experience can alter.

   So also, whether I feel it or not, I am dead with Christ. How can I be
   sure? Because Christ has died; and since "one died for all, therefore
   all died" (2 Cor. 5:14). Whether my experience proves it or seems to
   disprove it, the fact remains unchanged. While I stand upon that fact
   Satan cannot prevail against me. Remember that his attack is always
   upon our assurance. If he can get us to doubt God's Word, then his
   object is secured and he has us in his power; but if we rest unshaken
   in the assurance of God's stated fact, assured that He cannot do
   injustice to His work or His Word, then it does not matter what tactics
   Satan adopts, we can well afford to laugh at him. If anyone should try
   to persuade me that I am not Mr. Nee, I could well afford to do the
   same.

   "We walk by faith, not by appearance" (2 Cor. 5:7, mg). You probably
   know the illustration of Fact, Faith and Experience walking along the
   top of a wall. Fact walked steadily on, turning neither to right nor
   left and never looking behind. Faith followed and all went well so long
   as he kept his eyes focused upon Fact; but as soon as he became
   concerned about Experience and turned to see how he was getting on, he
   lost his balance and tumbled off the wall, and poor old Experience fell
   down after him.

   All temptation is primarily to look within; to take our eyes off the
   Lord and to take account of appearances. Faith is always meeting a
   mountain, a mountain of evidence that seems to contradict God's Word, a
   mountain of apparent contradiction in the realm of tangible fact--of
   failures in deed, as well as in the realm of feeling and
   suggestion--and either faith or the mountain has to go. They cannot
   both stand. but the trouble is that many a time the mountain stays and
   faith goes. That must not be. If we resort to our senses to discover
   the truth, we shall find Satan's lies are often enough true to our
   experience; but if we refuse to accept as binding anything that
   contradicts God's Word and maintain an attitude of faith in Him alone,
   we shall find instead that Satan's lies begin to dissolve and that our
   experience is coming progressively to tally with that Word.

   It is our occupation with Christ that has this result, for it means
   that He becomes progressively real to us on concrete issues. In a given
   situation we see Him as real holiness, real resurrection life--for us.
   What we see in Him objectively now operates in us subjectively--but
   really --to manifest Him in us in that situation. That is the mark of
   maturity. That is what Paul means by his words to the Galatians: "I am
   again in travail until Christ be formed in you" (4:19). Faith is
   substantiating' God's facts; and faith is always the substantiating' of
   eternal fact--of something eternally true.

Abiding In Him

   Now although we have already spent long on this matter, there is a
   further thing that may help to make it clearer to us. the Scriptures
   declare that we are "dead indeed", but nowhere do they say that we are
   dead in ourselves. We shall look in vain to find death within; that is
   just the place where it is not to be found. We are dead not in
   ourselves but in Christ. We were crucified with Him because we were in
   Him.

   We are familiar with the words of the Lord Jesus, "Abide in me, and I
   in you" (John 15:4). Let us consider them for a moment. First they
   remind us once again that we have never to struggle to get into Christ.
   We are not told to get there, for we are told to stay there where we
   have been placed. It was God's own act that put us in Christ, and we
   are to abide in Him.

   But further, this verse lays down for us a Divine principle, which is
   that God has done the work in Christ and not in us as individuals. The
   all-inclusive death and the all-inclusive resurrection of God's Son
   were accomplished fully and finally apart from us in the first place.
   It is the history of Christ which is to become the experience apart
   from Him. The Scriptures tell us that we were crucified "with Him",
   that we were quickened, raised, and set by God in the heavenlies "in
   Him", and that we are complete "in Him" (Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:5, 6; Col.
   2:10). It is not just something that is still to be effected in us
   (though it is that, of course). It is something that has already been
   effected, in association with Him.

   In the Scriptures we find that no Christian experience exists as such.
   What God has done in His gracious purpose is to include us in Christ.
   In dealing with Christ God has dealt with the Christian; in dealing
   with the Head He has dealt with all the members. It is altogether wrong
   for us to think that we can experience anything of the spiritual life
   in ourselves merely, and apart from Him. God does not intend that we
   should acquire something exclusively personal in our experience, and He
   is not willing to effect anything like that for you and me. All the
   spiritual experience of the Christian is already true in Christ. It has
   already been experienced by Christ. What we call our' experience is
   only our entering into His history and His experience.

   It would be odd if one branch of a vine tried to bear grapes with a
   reddish skin, and another branch tried to bear grapes with a green
   skin, and yet another branch grapes with a very dark purple skin, each
   branch trying to produce something of its own without reference to the
   vine. It is impossible, unthinkable. The character of the branches is
   determined by the vine. Yet certain Christians are seeking experiences
   as experiences. They think of crucifixion as something, of
   resurrections as something, of ascension as something, and they never
   stop to think that the whole is related to a Person. No, only as the
   Lord opens our eyes to see the Person do we have any true experience.
   Every true spiritual experience means that we have discovered a certain
   fact in Christ and have entered into that; anything that is not from
   Him in this way is an experience that is going to evaporate very soon.
   I have discovered that in Christ; then, Praise the Lord, it is mine! I
   possess it, Lord, because it is in Thee.' Oh it is a great thing to
   know the facts of Christ as the foundation for our experience.

   So God's basic principle in leading us on experimentally is not to give
   us something. It is not to bring us through something, and as a result
   to put something into us which we can call our experience'. It is not
   that God effects something within us so that we can say, I died with
   Christ last March' or I was raised from the dead on January 1st, 1937,'
   or even, Last Wednesday I asked for a definite experience and I have
   got it'. No, that is not the way. I do not seek experiences in
   themselves as in this present year of grace. Time must not be allowed
   to dominate my thinking here.

   Then, some will say, what about the crises so many of us have passed
   through? True, some of us have passed through real crises in our lives.
   For instance George Muller could say, bowing himself down to the
   ground, There was a day when George Muller died'. How about that? Well,
   I am not questioning the reality of the spiritual experiences we go
   through nor the importance of crises to which God brings us in our walk
   with Him; indeed, I have already stressed the need for us to be quite
   as definite ourselves about such crisis in our own lives. But the point
   is that God does not give individuals individual experiences. All that
   they have is only an entering into what God has already done. It is the
   realizing' in time of eternal things. The history of Christ becomes our
   experience and our spiritual history; we do not have a separate history
   from His. The entire work regarding us is not done in us here but in
   Christ. He does no separate work in individuals apart from what He has
   done there. Even eternal life is not given to us as individuals: the
   life is in the Son, and "he that hath the Son hath the life". God has
   done all in His Son, and He has included us in Him; we are incorporated
   into Christ.

   Now the point of all this is that there is a very real practical value
   in the stand of faith that says, God has put me in Christ, and
   therefore all that is true of Him is true of me. I will abide in Him.'
   Satan is always trying to get us out, to keep us out, to convince us
   that we are out, and by temptations, failures, suffering, trial, to
   make us feel acutely that we are outside of Christ. Our first thought
   is that, if we were in Christ, we should not be in this state, and
   therefore, judging by the feelings we now have, we must be out of Him;
   and so we begin to pray, Lord, put me into Christ'. No! God's
   injunction is to "abide" in Christ, and that is the way of deliverance.
   But how is it so? Because it opens the way for God to take a hand in
   our lives and to work the thing out in us. It makes room for the
   operation of His superior power--the power of resurrection (Rom. 6:4,
   9, 10)--so that the facts of Christ do progressively become the facts
   of our daily experience, and where before "sin reigned" (Rom. 5:21) we
   make now the joyful discovery that we are truly "no longer... in
   bondage to sin" (Rom. 6:6).

   As we stand steadfastly on the ground of what Christ is, we find that
   all that is true of Him is becoming experimentally true in us. If
   instead we come onto the ground of what we are in ourselves we will
   find that all that is true of the old nature remains true of us. If we
   get there in faith we have everything; if we return back here we find
   nothing. So often we go to the wrong place to find the death of self.
   It is in Christ. We have only to look within to find we are very much
   alive to sin; but when we look over there to the Lord, God sees to it
   that death works here but that "newness of life" is ours also. We are
   "alive unto God" (Rom. 6:4, 11).

   "Abide in me, and I in you." This is a double sentence: a command
   coupled with a promise. That is to say, there is an objective and a
   subjective side to God's working, and the subjective side depends upon
   the objective; the "I in you" is the outcome of our abiding in Him. We
   need to guard against being over-anxious about the subjective side of
   things, and so becoming turned in upon ourselves. We need to dwell upon
   the objective--"abide in me"--and to let God take care of the
   subjective. And this He has undertaken to do.

   I have illustrated this from the electric light. You are in a room and
   it is growing dark. You would like to have the light on in order to
   read. There is a reading-lamp on the table beside you. What do you do?
   Do you watch it intently to see if the light will come on? Do you take
   a cloth and polish the bulb? No, you get up and cross over to the other
   side of the room where the switch is on the wall and you turn the
   current on. You turn your attention to the source of power and when you
   have taken the necessary action there the light comes on here.

   So in our walk with the Lord our attention must be fixed on Christ.
   "Abide in me, and I in you" is the Divine order. Faith in the objective
   facts make those facts true subjectively. As the apostle Paul puts it,
   "We all... beholding... the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the
   same image" (2 Cor. 3:18 mg.). The same principle holds good in the
   matter of fruitfulness of life: "He that abideth in me, and I in him,
   the same beareth much fruit" (John 15:5). We do not try to produce
   fruit or concentrate upon the fruit produced. Our business is to look
   away to Him. As we do so He undertakes to fulfill His Word in us.

   How do we abide? Of God are ye in Christ Jesus.' It was the work of God
   to put you there and He has done it. Now stay there! Do not be moved
   back onto your own ground. Never look at yourself as though you were
   not in Christ. Look at Christ and see yourself in Him. Abide in Him.
   Rest in the fact that God has put you in His Son, and live in the
   expectation that He will complete His work in you. It is for Him to
   make good the glorious promise that "sin shall not have dominion over
   you" (Rom. 6:14).

Chapter 5: The Divide of the Cross

   The kingdom of this world is not this kingdom of God. God had in His
   heart a world-system - a universe of His creating--which should be
   headed up in Christ His Son (Col. 1:16, 17). But Satan, working through
   man's flesh, has set up instead a rival system known in Scripture as
   "this world"--a system in which we are involved and which he himself
   dominates. He has in fact become "the prince of this world" (John
   12:31).
     __________________________________________________________________

Two Creations

   Thus, in Satan's hands, the first creation has become the old creation,
   and God's primary concern is now no longer with that but with a second
   and new creation. He is bringing in a new creation, a new kingdom and a
   new world, and nothing of the old creation, the old kingdom or the old
   world can be transferred to the new. It is a question now of these two
   rival realms, and of which realm we belong to.

   The apostle Paul, of course, leaves us in no doubt as to which of these
   two realms is now in fact ours. He tells us that God, in redemption,
   "delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the
   kingdom of the Son of his love" (Col. 1:12, 13).

   But in order to bring us into His new kingdom, God must do something
   new in us. He must make of us new creatures. Unless we are created anew
   we can never fit into the new realm. "That which is born of the flesh
   is flesh"; and, "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;
   neither doth corruption inherit incorruption" (John 3:6; 1 Cor. 15:50).
   However educated, however cultured, however improved it be, flesh is
   still flesh. Our fitness for the new kingdom is determined by the
   creation to which we belong. Do we belong to the old creation or the
   new? Are we born of the flesh or of the Spirit? Our ultimate
   suitability for the new realm hinges on the question of origin. The
   question is not good' or bad?' but flesh or Spirit?' "That which is
   born of the flesh is flesh", and it will never be anything else. That
   which is of the old creation can never pass over into the new.

   Once we really understand what God is seeking, namely, something
   altogether new for Himself, then we shall see clearly that we can never
   bring any contribution from the old realm into that new thing. God
   wanted to have us for Himself, but He could not bring us as we were
   into that which He had purposed; so He first did away with us by the
   Cross of Christ, and then by resurrection provided a new life for us.
   "If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature (mg. there is a new
   creation'): the old things are passed away; behold, they are become
   new" (2 Cor. 5:17). Being now new creatures with a new nature and a new
   set of faculties, we can enter the new kingdom and the new world.

   The Cross was the means God used to bring to an end the old things' by
   setting aside altogether our old man', and the resurrection was the
   means He employed to impart to us all that was necessary for our life
   in that new world. "We were buried therefore with him through baptism
   into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the
   glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life" (Rom.
   6:4).

   The greatest negative in the universe is the Cross, for with it God
   wiped out everything that was not of Himself: the greatest positive in
   the universe is the resurrection, for through it God brought into being
   all He will have in the new sphere. So the resurrection stands at the
   threshold of the new creation. It is a blessed thing to see that the
   Cross ends all that belongs to the first regime, and that the
   resurrection introduces all that pertains to the second. Everything
   that had its beginning before resurrection must be wiped out.
   Resurrection is God's new starting-point.

   We have now two worlds before us, the old and the new. In the old,
   Satan has absolute dominion. You may be a good man in the old creation,
   but as long as you belong to the old you are under sentence of death,
   because nothing of the old can go over to the new. The Cross is God's
   declaration that all that is of the old creation must die. Nothing of
   the first Adam can pass beyond the Cross; it all ends there. The sooner
   we see that, the better, for it is by the Cross that God has made a way
   of escape for us from that old creation. God gathered up in the Person
   of His Son all that was of Adam and crucified Him; so in Him all that
   was of Adam was done away. Then God made, as it were, a proclamation
   throughout the universe saying: Through the Cross I have set aside all
   that is not of Me; you who belong to the old creation are all included
   in that; you too have been crucified with Christ!' None of us can
   escape that verdict.

   This brings us to the subject of baptism. "Are ye ignorant that all we
   who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We
   were buried therefore with him through baptism into death" (Rom. 6:3,
   4). What is the significance of these words?

   Baptism in Scripture is associated with salvation. "He that believeth
   and is baptized shall be saved" (Mark 16:16). We cannot speak
   scripturally of baptismal regeneration' but we may speak of baptismal
   salvation'. What is salvation? It relates not to our sins nor to the
   power of sin, but to the cosmos or world-system. We are involved in
   Satan's world-system. To be saved is to make our exit from his
   world-system into God's

   In the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, says Paul, "the world hath been
   crucified unto me, and I unto the world" (Gal. 6:14). This is the
   figure developed by Peter when he writes of the eight souls who were
   "saved through water" (1 Peter 3:20). Entering into the ark, Noah and
   those with him stepped by faith out of that old corrupt world into a
   new one. It was not so much that they were personally not drowned, but
   that they were out of that corrupt system. That is salvation.

   Then Peter goes on: "Which also after a true likeness (mg. in the
   antitype') doth now save you, even baptism" (verse 21). In other words,
   by that aspect of the Cross which is figured in baptism you are
   delivered from this present evil world, and, by your baptism in water,
   you confirm this. It is baptism "into his death", ending one creation;
   but it is also baptism "into Christ Jesus", having in view a new one
   (Rom. 6:3). You go down into the water and your world, in figure, goes
   down with you. you come up in Christ, but your world is drowned.

   "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved", said Paul at
   Philippi, and "spake the word of the Lord" to the jailer and his
   household. And he "was baptized, he and all his, immediately" (Acts
   16:31-34). In doing so, he and those with him testified before God, His
   people and the spiritual powers that they were indeed saved from a
   world under judgment. As a result, we read, they rejoiced greatly,
   "having believed in God".

   Thus it is clear that baptism is no mere question of a cup of water,
   nor of a baptistry of water. It is a tremendous thing, relating as it
   does both to the death and to the resurrection of our Lord; and having
   in view two worlds. Anyone who has worked in a pagan country knows what
   tremendous issues are raised by baptism.
     __________________________________________________________________

Burial Means An End

   Peter goes on now to describe baptism in the passage just quoted as
   "the answer of a good conscience toward God" (1 Peter 3:21 A.V.). Now
   we cannot answer without being spoken to . If God had said nothing we
   should have no need to answer. But He has spoken; He has spoken to us
   by the Cross. By it He has told of His judgment of us, of the world, of
   the old creation and of the old kingdom. The Cross is not only Christ's
   personally--an individual' Cross. It is an all inclusive Cross, a
   corporate' Cross, a Cross that includes you and me. God has put us all
   into His Son, and crucified us in Him. In the last Adam He has wiped
   out all that was of the first Adam.

   Now what is my answer to God's verdict on the old creation? I answer by
   asking for baptism. Why? In Romans 6:4 Paul explains that baptism means
   burial: "We were buried therefore with him through baptism". Baptism is
   of course connected with both death and resurrection, though in itself
   it is neither death nor resurrection: it is burial. But who qualifies
   for burial? Only the dead! So if I ask for baptism I proclaim myself
   dead and fit only for the grave.

   Alas, some have been taught to look on burial as a means to death; they
   try to die by getting themselves buried! Let me say emphatically that,
   unless our eyes have been opened by God to see that we have died in
   Christ and been buried with Him, we have no right to be baptized. The
   reason we step down into the water is that we have recognized that in
   God's sight we have already died. It is to that that we testify. God's
   question is clear and simple. Christ has died, and I have included you
   there. Now, what are you going to say to that?' What is my answer?
   Lord, I believe You have done the crucifying. I say Yes to the death
   and to the burial to which You have committed me.' He has consigned me
   to death and the grave; by my request for baptism I give public assent
   to that fact.

   In China a woman lost her husband, but, becoming deranged by her loss,
   she flatly refused to have him buried. Day after day for a fortnight he
   lay in the house. No', she said, he is not dead; I talk with him every
   night.' She was unwilling to have him buried because, poor woman, she
   did not believe him to be dead. When are we willing to bury our dear
   ones? Only when we are absolutely sure that they have passed away.
   While there is the tiniest hope that they are alive we will never bury
   them. So when will I ask for baptism? When I see that God's way is
   perfect and that I deserved to die, and when I truly believe that God
   has already crucified me. Once I am fully persuaded that, before God, I
   am quite dead, then I apply for baptism. I say, Praise God, I am dead!
   Lord, You have slain me; now get me buried!'

   In China we have two emergency Services, a Red Cross' and a Blue Cross'
   The first deals with those who are wounded in battle but are still
   alive, to bring them succour and healing; the second deals with those
   who are already dead in famine, flood or war, to give them burial.
   God's dealings with us in the Cross of Christ are more drastic than
   those of the Red Cross'. He does not set out to patch up the old
   creation. By Him even the still living are condemned to death and to
   burial, that they may be raised again to new life. God has done the
   work of crucifixion so that now we are counted among the dead; but we
   must accept this and submit to the work of the Blue Cross', by sealing
   that death with burial'.

   There is an old world and a new world, and between the two there is a
   tomb. God has already crucified me, but I must consent to be consigned
   to the tomb. My baptism confirms God's sentence, passed upon me in the
   Cross of His Son. It affirms that I am cut off from the old world and
   belong now to the new. So baptism is no small thing. It means for me a
   definite conscious break with the old way of life. This is the meaning
   of Romans 6:2: "We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live
   therein?" Paul says, in effect, If you would continue in the old world,
   why be baptized? You should never have been baptized if you meant to
   live on in the old realm'. When once we see this, we clear the ground
   for the new creation by our assent to the burial of the old.

   In Romans 6:5, still writing to those who "were baptized" (verse 3),
   Paul speaks of our being "united with him by the likeness of his
   death". For by baptism we acknowledge in a figure that God has wrought
   an intimate union between ourselves and Christ in this matter of death
   and resurrection. One day I was seeking to emphasize this truth to a
   Christian brother. We happened to be drinking tea together, so I took a
   lump of sugar and stirred it into my tea. A couple of minutes later I
   asked, Can you tell me where the sugar is now, and where the tea?' No',
   he said, you have put them together and the one has become lost in the
   other; they cannot now be separated.' It was a simple illustration, but
   it helped him to see the intimacy and the finality of our union with
   Christ in death. It is God that has put us there, and God's acts cannot
   be reversed.

   What, in fact does this union imply? The real meaning behind baptism is
   that in the Cross we were baptized' into the historic death of Christ,
   so that His death became ours. Our death and His became then so closely
   identified that it is impossible to divide between them. It is to this
   historic baptism'--this God-wrought union with Him--that we assent when
   we go down into the water. Our public testimony in baptism today is our
   admission that the death of Christ two thousand years ago was a mighty
   all-inclusive death, mighty enough and all-inclusive enough to carry
   away in it and bring to an end everything in us that is not of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

Resurrection Unto Newness Of Life

   "If we have become united with him by the likeness of his death, we
   shall be also be the likeness of his resurrection (Rom. 6:5).

   Now with resurrection the figure is different because something new is
   introduced. I am "baptized into his death", but I do not enter in quite
   the same way into His resurrection, for, Praise the Lord! His
   resurrection enters into me, imparting to me a new life. In the death
   of the Lord the emphasis is solely upon I in Christ'. With the
   resurrection, while the same thing is true, there is now a new emphasis
   upon Christ in me'. How is it possible for Christ to communicate His
   resurrection life to me? How do I receive this new life? Paul suggests,
   I think, a very good illustration with these very same words: "united
   with him". For the word united' (A.V. planted together') may carry in
   the Greek the sense of grafted' [6] and it gives us a very beautiful
   picture of the life of Christ which is imparted to us through
   resurrection.

   In Fukien I once visited a man who owned an orchard of long-ien [7]
   trees. He had three or four acres of land and about three hundred fruit
   trees. I inquired if his trees had been grafted or if they were of the
   original native stock. Do you think', he replied, that I would waste my
   land growing ungrafted trees? What value could I ever expect from the
   old stock?

   So I asked him to explain the process of grafting, which he gladly did.
   When a tree has grown to a certain height', he said, I lop off the top
   and graft on to it.' Pointing to a special tree he asked, Do you see
   that tree? I call it the father tree, because all the grafts for the
   other trees are taken from that one. If the other trees were just left
   to follow the course of nature, their fruit would be only about the
   size of a raspberry, and would consist mainly of thick skin and seeds.
   This tree, from which the grafts for all the others are taken, bears a
   luscious fruit the size of a plum, with very thin skin and a tiny seed;
   and of course all the grafted trees bear fruit like it.' How does it
   happen?' I asked. I simply take a little of the nature of the one tree
   and transfer it to the other', he explained. I make a cleavage in the
   poor tree and insert a slip from the good one. Then I bind it up and
   leave it to grow.' But how can it grow?' I asked. I don't know', he
   said, but it does grow.'

   Then he showed me a tree bearing miserably poor fruit from the old
   stock below the graft, and rich juicy fruit from the new stock above
   the graft. I have left the old shoots with their useless fruit on them
   to show the difference', he said. From it you can understand the value
   of grafting. You can appreciate, can you not, why I grow only grafted
   trees?'

   How can one tree bear the fruit of another? How can a poor tree bear
   good fruit? Only by grafting. Only by our implanting into it the life
   of a good tree. But if a man can graft a branch of one tree into
   another, cannot God take of the life of His Son and, so to speak, graft
   it into us?

   A Chinese woman burned her arm badly and was taken to hospital. In
   order to prevent serious contracture due to scarring it was found
   necessary to graft some new skin over the injured area, but the doctor
   attempted in vain to graft a piece of the woman's own skin onto the
   arm. Owing to her age and ill-nourishment the skin graft was too poor
   and would not take'. Then a foreign nurse offered a piece of skin and
   the operation was carried out successfully. The new skin knit with the
   old, and the woman left the hospital with her arm perfectly healed; but
   there remained a patch of white foreign skin on her yellow arm to tell
   the tale of the past. You ask how the skin of another grew on that
   woman's arm? I do not know how it grew, but I know that it did grow.

   If an earthly surgeon can take a piece of skin from one human body and
   graft it on another, [8] cannot the Divine Surgeon implant the life of
   His Son into me? I do not know how it is done. "The wind bloweth where
   it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence
   it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the
   Spirit" (John 3:8). We cannot tell how God has done His work in us, but
   it is done. We can do nothing and need do nothing to bring it about,
   for by the resurrection God has already done it.

   God has done everything. There is only one fruitful life in the world
   and that has been grafted into millions of other lives. We call this
   the new birth'. New birth is the reception of a life which I did not
   possess before. It is not that my natural life has been changed at all;
   it is that another life, a life altogether new, altogether Divine, has
   become my life.

   God has cut off the old creation by the Cross of His Son in order to
   bring in a new creation in Christ by resurrection. He has shut the door
   to that old kingdom of darkness and translated me into the kingdom of
   His dear Son. My glorying is in the fact that it has been done--that,
   through the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , that old world has " been
   crucified unto me, and I unto the world" (Galatians 6:14). My baptism
   is my public testimony to that fact. By it, as by my oral witness, my
   "confession is made unto salvation" (Romans 10:10).

Chapter 6: The Path of Progress: Presenting Ourselves to God

   Our study has now brought us to the point where we are able to consider
   the true nature of consecration. We have before us the second half of
   Romans 6 from verse 12 to the end. In Romans 6:12, 13 we read: "Let not
   sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts
   thereof: neither present your members unto sin as instruments of
   unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the
   dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God." The
   operative word here is "present" and this occurs five times, in verses
   13, 16 and 19. [9]

   Many have taken this word "present" to imply consecration without
   looking carefully into its content. Of course that is what it does
   mean, but not in the sense in which we so often understand it. It is
   not the consecration of our old man' with his instincts and
   resources--our natural wisdom, strength and other gifts--to the Lord
   for Him to use.

   This will be at once clear from verse 13. Note there the clause "as
   alive from the dead". Paul says: "Present yourselves unto God, as alive
   from the dead". This defines for us the point at which consecration
   begins. For what is here referred to is not the consecration of
   anything belonging to the old creation, but only of that which has
   passed through death to resurrection. The presenting' spoken of is the
   outcome of my knowing my old man to be crucified. Knowing, reckoning,
   presenting to God: that is the Divine order.

   When I really know I am crucified with Him, then spontaneously I reckon
   myself dead (verses 6 and 11); and when I know that I am raised with
   Him from the dead, then likewise I reckon myself "alive unto God in
   Christ Jesus" (verses 9 and 11), for both the death and the
   resurrection side of the Cross are to be accepted by faith. When this
   point is reached, giving myself to Him follows. In resurrection He is
   the source of my life--indeed He is my life; so I cannot but present
   everything to Him, for all is His, not mine. But without passing
   through death I have nothing to consecrate, nor is there anything God
   can accept, for He has condemned all that is of the old creation to the
   Cross. Death has cut off all that cannot be consecrated to Him, and
   resurrection alone has made consecration possible. Presenting myself to
   God means that henceforth I consider my whole life as now belonging to
   the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Third Step: "Present Yourselves..."

   Let us observe that this presenting' relates to the members of my
   body--that body which, as we said earlier, is now unemployed in respect
   to sin. "Present yourselves... and your members", says Paul, and again:
   "Present your members" (Romans 6:13, 19). God requires of me that I now
   regard all my members, all my faculties, as belonging wholly to Him.

   It is a great thing when I discover I am no longer my own but His. If
   the ten shillings in my pocket belong to me, then I have full authority
   over them. But if they belong to another who has committed them to me
   in trust, then I cannot buy what I please with them, and I dare not
   lose them. Real Christian life begins with knowing this. How many of us
   know that, because Christ is risen, we are therefore alive "unto God"
   and not unto ourselves? How many of us dare not use our time or money
   or talents as we would, because we realize they are the Lord's not
   ours? How many of us have such a strong sense that we belong to Another
   that we dare not squander a shilling of our money, or an hour of our
   time, or any of our mental or physical powers?

   On one occasion a Chinese brother was traveling by train and found
   himself in a carriage together with three non-Christians who wished to
   play cards in order to while away the time. Lacking a fourth to
   complete the game, they invited this brother to join them. I am sorry
   to disappoint you', he said, but I cannot join your game for I have not
   brought my hands with me.' Whatever do you mean?' they asked in blank
   astonishment. This pair of hands does not belong to me', he said, and
   then there followed the explanation of the transfer of ownership that
   had taken place in his life. That brother regarded the members of his
   body as belonging entirely to the Lord. That is true holiness.

   Paul says, "Present your members as servants to righteousness unto
   sanctification (A.V. holiness')" (Romans 6:19). Make it a definite act.
   "Present yourselves to God."
     __________________________________________________________________

Separated Unto The Lord

   What is holiness? Many people think we become holy by the eradication
   of something evil within. No, we become holy by being separated unto
   God. In Old Testament times, it was when a man was chosen by God to be
   altogether His that he was publicly anointed with oil and was then said
   to be sanctified'. Thereafter he was regarded as set apart to God. In
   the same manner even animals or material things--a lamb, or the gold of
   the temple--could be sanctified, not by the eradication of anything
   evil in them, but by being thus reserved exclusively to the Lord.
   "Holiness' in the Hebrew sense meant something thus set apart, and all
   true holiness is holiness "to the Lord" (Exodus 28:36). I give myself
   over wholly to Christ: that is holiness.

   Presenting myself to God implies a recognition that I am altogether
   His. This giving of myself is a definite thing, just as definite as
   reckoning. There must be a day in my life when I pass out of my own
   hands into His, and from that day forward I belong to Him and no longer
   to myself. That does not mean that I consecrate myself to be a preacher
   or a missionary. Alas, many people are missionaries not because they
   have truly consecrated themselves to God but because, in the sense of
   which we are speaking, they have not consecrated themselves to Him.
   They have consecrated' (as they would put it) something altogether
   different, namely, their own uncrucified natural faculties to the doing
   of His work; but that is not true consecration. Then to what are we to
   be consecrated? Not to Christian work, but to the will of God to be and
   do whatever He wants.

   David had many mighty men. Some were generals and others were
   gatekeepers, according as the king assigned them their task. We must be
   willing to be either generals or gatekeepers, allotted to our parts
   just as God wills and not as we choose. If you are a Christian, then
   God has marked out a pathway for you--a course' as Paul calls it in 2
   Timothy 4:7. Not only Paul's path but the path of every Christian has
   been clearly marked out by God, and it is of supreme importance that
   each one should know and walk in the God-appointed course. Lord, I give
   myself to Thee with this desire alone, to know and walk in the path
   Thou hast ordained.' That is true giving. If at the close of a life we
   can say with Paul: "I have finished my course", then we are blessed
   indeed. There is nothing more tragic than to come to the end of life
   and know we have been on the wrong course. We have only one life to
   live down here and we are free to do as we please with it, but if we
   seek our own pleasure our life will never glorify God. A devoted
   Christian once said in my hearing, I want nothing for myself; I want
   everything for God.' Do you want anything apart from God, or does all
   your desire center in His will? Can you truly say that the will of God
   is "good and acceptable and perfect" to you? (Romans 12:2)

   For it is our wills that are in question here. That strong
   self-assertive will of mine must go to the Cross, and I must give
   myself over wholly to the Lord. We cannot expect a tailor to make us a
   coat if we do not give him any cloth, nor a builder to build us a house
   if we let him have no building material; and in just the same way we
   cannot expect the Lord to live out His life in us if we do not give Him
   our lives in which to live. Without reservations, without controversy,
   we must give ourselves to Him to do as He pleases with us. "Present
   yourselves unto God" (Romans 6:13).
     __________________________________________________________________

Servant Or Slave?

   If we give ourselves unreservedly to God, many adjustments may have to
   be made: in family, or business, or church relationships, or in the
   matter of our personal views. God will not let anything of ourselves
   remain. His finger will touch, point by point, everything that is not
   of Him, and He will say: This must go'. Are you willing? It is foolish
   to resist God, and always wise to submit to Him. We admit that many of
   us still have controversies with the Lord. He wants something, while we
   want something else. Many things we dare not look into, dare not pray
   about, dare not even think about, lest we lose our peace. We can evade
   the issue in that way, but to do so will bring us out of the will of
   God. It is always an easy matter to get out of His will, but it is a
   blessed thing just to hand ourselves over to Him and let Him have His
   way with us.

   How good it is to have the consciousness that we belong to the Lord and
   are not our own! There is nothing more precious in the world. It is
   that which brings the awareness of His continual presence, and the
   reason is obvious. I must first have the sense of God's possession of
   me before I can have the sense of His presence with me. When once His
   ownership is established, then I dare do nothing in my own interests,
   for I am His exclusive property. "Know ye not, that to whom ye present
   yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye
   obey?" (Romans 6:16). The word here rendered servant' really signifies
   a bondservant, a slave. This word is used several times in the second
   half of Romans 6. What is the difference between a servant and a slave?
   A servant may serve another, but the ownership does not pass to that
   other. If he likes his master he can serve him, but if he does not like
   him he can give in his notice and seek another master. Not so is it
   with the slave. He is not only the servant of another but he is the
   possession of another. How did I become the slave of the Lord? On His
   part He bought me, and on my part I presented myself to Him. By right
   of redemption I am God's property, but if I would be His slave I must
   willingly give myself to Him, for He will never compel me to do so.

   The trouble with many Christians today is that they have an
   insufficient idea of what God is asking of them. How glibly they say:
   Lord, I am willing for anything.' Do you know that God is asking of you
   your very life? There are cherished ideals, strong wills, precious
   relationships, much-loved work, that will have to go; so do not give
   yourself to God unless you mean it. God will take you seriously, even
   if you did not mean it seriously.

   When the Galilian boy brought his bread to the Lord, what did the Lord
   do with it? He broke it. God will always break what is offered to Him.
   He breaks what He takes, but after breaking it He blesses and uses it
   to meet the needs of others. After you give yourself to the Lord, He
   begins to break what was offered to Him. Everything seems to go wrong,
   and you protest and find fault with the ways of God. But to stay there
   is to be no more than just a broken vessel--no good for the world
   because you have gone too far for the world to use you, and no good for
   God either because you have not gone far enough for Him to use you. You
   are out of gear with the world, and you have a controversy with God.
   This is the tragedy of many a Christian.

   My giving of myself to the Lord must be an initial fundamental act.
   Then day by day I must go on giving to Him, not finding fault with His
   use of me but accepting with praise even what the flesh revolts
   against.

   I am the Lord's and now no longer reckon myself to be my own but
   acknowledge in everything His ownership and authority. That is the
   attitude God requires, and to maintain it is true consecration. I do
   not consecrate myself to be a missionary or a preacher; I consecrate
   myself to God to do His will where I am, be it in school, office or
   kitchen, counting whatever He ordains for me to be the very best, for
   nothing but good can come to those who are wholly His.

   May we always be possessed by the consciousness that we are not our
   own.

Chapter 7: The Eternal Purpose

   We have spoken of the need of revelation, of faith and of consecration,
   if we are to live the normal Christian life. But unless we see the end
   God has in view we shall never clearly understand why these steps are
   necessary to lead us to that end. Before therefore we consider further
   the question of inward experience, let us first look at the great
   Divine goal before us.

   What is God's purpose in creation and what is His purpose in
   redemption? It may be summed up in two phrases, one from each of our
   two sections of Romans. It is: "The glory of God" (Romans 3:23), and
   "The glory of the children of God" (Romans 8:21).

   In Romans 3:23 we read: "All have sinned, and fall short of the glory
   of God". God's purpose for man was glory, but sin thwarted that purpose
   by causing man to miss God's glory. When we think of sin we
   instinctively think of the judgment it brings; we invariably associate
   it with condemnation and hell. Man's thought is always of the
   punishment that will come to him if he sins, but God's thought is
   always of the glory man will miss if he sins. The result of sin is that
   we forfeit God's glory: the result of redemption is that we are
   qualified again for glory. God's purpose in redemption is glory, glory,
   glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

Firstborn Among Many Brethren

   This consideration takes us forward into Romans chapter 8 where the
   topic is developed in verses 16 to 18 and again in verses 29 and 30.
   Paul says: "We are children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs
   of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him,
   that we may be also glorified with him. For I reckon that the
   sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
   glory which shall be revealed to us" (Romans 8:16-18); and again: "Whom
   he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his
   Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren: and whom he
   foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
   justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified" (Romans 8:29,
   30). What was God's objective? It was that His Son Jesus Christ might
   be the firstborn among many brethren, all of whom should be conformed
   to His image. How did God realize that objective? "Whom he justified,
   them he also glorified." God's purpose, then, in creation and
   redemption was to make Christ the firstborn Son among many glorified
   sons. That may perhaps at first convey very little to many of us, but
   let us look into it more carefully.

   In John 1:14 we are told that the Lord Jesus was God's only begotten
   Son: "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his
   glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father)". That He was
   God's only begotten Son signifies that God had no other Son but this
   one. He was with the Father from all eternity. But, we are told, God
   was not satisfied that Christ should remain the only begotten Son; He
   wanted also to make Him His first begotten. How could an only begotten
   Son become a first begotten? The answer is simple: by the Father having
   more children. If you have but one son then his is the only begotten,
   but if thereafter you have other children then the only begotten
   becomes the first begotten.

   The Divine purpose in creation and redemption was that God should have
   many children. He wanted us, and could not be satisfied without us.
   Some time ago I called to see Mr. George Cutting, the writer of the
   well-known tract Safety, Certainty and Enjoyment. When I was ushered
   into the presence of this old saint of ninety-three years, he took my
   hand in his and in a quiet, deliberate way he said: Brother, do you
   know, I cannot do without Him? And do you know, He cannot do without
   me?' Though I was with him for over an hour, his great age and physical
   frailty made any sustained conversation impossible. But what remains in
   my memory of that interview was his frequent repetition of these two
   questions: Brother, do you know, I cannot do without Him? And do you
   know, He cannot do without me?'

   In reading the story of the prodigal son most people are impressed with
   all the troubles the prodigal meets; they are occupied in thinking what
   a bad time he is having. But that is not the point of the parable. "My
   son... was lost, and is found"--there is the heart of the story. It is
   not a question of what the son suffers but of what the Father loses. He
   is the sufferer; He is the loser. A sheep is lost: whose is the loss?
   The shepherd's. A coin is lost: whose is the loss? The woman's. A son
   is lost: whose is the loss? The Father's. That is the lesson of Luke
   chapter 15.

   The Lord Jesus was the only begotten Son, and as the only begotten He
   had no brothers. But the Father sent the Son in order that the only
   begotten might also be the first begotten, and the beloved Son have
   many brethren. There you have the whole story of the Incarnation and
   the Cross; and there you have at the last the purpose of God fulfilled
   in His "bringing many sons unto glory" (Heb. 2:10).

   In Romans 8:29 we read of "many brethren"; in Hebrews 2:10 of "many
   sons". From the point of view of the Lord Jesus it is "brethren"; from
   the point of view of God the Father it is "sons". Both words in this
   context convey the idea of maturity. God is seeking full-grown sons;
   but He does not stop even there. For He does not want His sons to live
   in a barn or a garage or a field; He wants them in His home; He wants
   them to share His glory. That is the explanation of Romans 8:30: "Whom
   he justified, them he also glorified." Sonship--the full expression of
   His Son--is God's goal in the many sons. How could He bring that about?
   By justifying them and then by glorifying them. In His dealings with
   them God will never stop short of that goal. He set Himself to have
   sons, and to have those sons, mature and responsible, with Him in
   glory. He made provision for the whole of Heaven to be peopled with
   glorified sons. That was His purpose in redemption.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Grain Of Wheat

   But how could God's only begotten Son become His first begotten? The
   method is explained in John 12:24: "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by
   itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit." Who was that
   grain? It was the Lord Jesus. In the whole universe God had only one
   grain of wheat'; He had no second grain. God put His one grain of wheat
   into the ground and it died, and in resurrection the only begotten
   grain became the first begotten grain, and from the one grain there
   have sprung many grains.

   In respect of His divinity the Lord Jesus remains uniquely "the only
   begotten Son of God". Yet there is a sense in which, from the
   resurrection onward through all eternity, He is also the first
   begotten, and His life from that time is found in many brethren. For we
   who are born of the Spirit are made thereby "partakers of the divine
   nature" (2 Peter 1:4), though not, mark you, as of ourselves but only,
   as we shall see in a moment, in dependence upon God and by virtue of
   our being in Christ'. We have "received the spirit of adoption, whereby
   we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit himself beareth witness with our
   spirit, that we are children of God" (Rom. 8:5, 16). It was by way of
   the Incarnation and the Cross that the Lord Jesus made this possible.
   Therein was the Father-heart of God satisfied, for in the Son's
   obedience unto death the Father has secured His many sons.

   The first and the twentieth chapters of John are in this respect most
   precious. In the beginning of his Gospel John tells us that Jesus was
   "the only begotten from the Father". At the end of his Gospel he tells
   us how, after the Lord Jesus died and rose again, He said to Mary
   Magdalene, "Go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my
   Father and your Father, and my God and your God" (John 20:17). Hitherto
   in this Gospel the Lord had spoken often of "the Father" or of "my
   Father". Now, in resurrection, He add, "...and your Father". It is the
   eldest Son, the first begotten, speaking. By His death and resurrection
   many brethren have been brought into God's family, and so, in the same
   verse He uses this very name for them: "My brethren". "He is not
   ashamed to call them brethren" (Heb. 2:11).
     __________________________________________________________________

The Choice That Confronted Adam

   God planted a great number of trees in the garden of Eden, but "in the
   midst of the garden"--that is, in a place of special prominence--He
   planted two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil. Adam was created innocent; he had no knowledge of good
   and evil. Think of a grown man, say thirty years old, who has no sense
   of right or wrong, no power to differentiate between the two! Would you
   not say such a man was undeveloped? Well, that is exactly what Adam
   was. And God brings him into the garden and says to him, in effect, Now
   the garden is full of trees, full of fruits, and of the fruit of every
   tree you may eat freely. But in the very midst of the garden is one
   tree called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"; you must not
   eat of that, for in the day that you do so you will surely die. But
   remember, the name of the other tree close by is Life.' What, then, is
   the meaning of these two trees? Adam was, so to speak, created morally
   neutral--neither sinful nor holy, but innocent--and God put those two
   trees there so that he might exercise free choice. He could choose the
   tree of life, or he could choose the tree of the knowledge of good and
   evil.

   Now the knowledge of good and evil, though forbidden to Adam, is not
   wrong in itself. Without it however Adam is in a sense limited in that
   he cannot decide for himself on moral issues. Judgment of right and
   wrong resides not in him but in God, and Adam's only course when faced
   with any question is to refer it to Jehovah God. Thus you have a life
   in the garden which is totally dependent on God. These two trees, then,
   typify two deep principles; they represent two planes of life, the
   Divine and the human. The "tree of life" is God Himself, for God is
   life. He is the highest form of life, and He is also the source and
   goal of life. And the fruit: what is that? It is our Lord Jesus Christ.
   You cannot eat the tree but you can eat the fruit. No one is able to
   receive God as God, but we can receive the Lord Jesus. The fruit is the
   edible part, the receivable part of the tree. So--may I say it
   reverently?--the Lord Jesus is really God in a receivable form. God in
   Christ we can receive.

   If Adam should take of the tree of life, he would partake of the life
   of God and thus become a son' of God, in the sense of having in him a
   life that derived from God. There you would have God's life in union
   with man: a race of men having the life of God in them and living in
   constant dependence upon God for that life. If on the other hand Adam
   should turn the other way and take the fruit of the tree of the
   knowledge of good and evil, then he would develop his own manhood along
   natural lines apart from God. Reaching a peak of attainment as a
   self-sufficient being, he would have the power in himself to form
   independent judgment, but he would have no life from God.

   So this was the alternative that lay before him. Choosing the way of
   the Spirit, the way of obedience, he could become a son' of God, living
   in dependence upon God for his life; or, taking the natural course, he
   could put the finishing touch to himself, as it were, by becoming a
   self-dependent being, judging and acting apart from God. The history of
   humanity is the outcome of the choice he made.
     __________________________________________________________________

Adam's Choice The Reason For The Cross

   Adam chose the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thereby took
   up independent ground. In doing so he became (as man is now in his own
   eyes) a fully developed' man. He could command a knowledge; he could
   decide for himself; he could go on or stop. From then on he was "wise"
   (Genesis 3:6). But the consequence for his was death rather than life,
   because the choice he had made involved complicity with Satan and
   brought him therefore under the judgment of God. That is why access to
   the tree of life had thereafter to be forbidden to him.

   Two planes of life had been set before Adam: that of Divine life in
   dependence upon God, and that of human life with its independent'
   resources. Adam's choice of the latter was sin, because thereby he
   allied himself with Satan to thwart the eternal purpose of God. He did
   so by choosing to develop his manhood--to become perhaps a very fine
   man, even by his standards a perfect' man--apart from God. But the end
   was death, because he had not in him the Divine life necessary to
   realize God's purpose in his being, but had chosen to become instead an
   independent' agent of the Enemy. Thus in Adam we all become sinners,
   equally dominated by Satan, equally subject to the law of sin and
   death, and equally deserving of the wrath of God.

   From this we see the Divine reason for the death and resurrection of
   the Lord Jesus. We see too the Divine reason for true consecration--for
   reckoning ourselves to be dead unto sin but alive unto God in Christ
   Jesus, and for presenting ourselves unto Him as alive from the dead. We
   must all go to the Cross, because what is in us by nature is a
   self-life, subject to the law of sin. Adam chose a self-life rather
   than a Divine life; so God had to gather up all that was in Adam and do
   away with it. Our old man' has been crucified. God has put us all in
   Christ and crucified Him as the last Adam, and thus all that is of Adam
   has passed away.

   Then Christ arose in new form; with a body still, but in the Spirit',
   no longer in the flesh'. "The last Adam became a life-giving spirit" (1
   Cor. 15:45). The Lord Jesus now has a resurrected body, a spiritual
   body, a glorious body, and since He is no longer in the flesh He can
   now be received by all. "He that eateth me, he also shall live because
   of me", said Jesus (John 6:57). The Jews revolted at the thought of
   eating His flesh and drinking His blood, but of course they could not
   receive Him then because He was still literally in the flesh. Now that
   He is in the Spirit every one of us can receive Him, and it is by
   partaking of His resurrection life that we are constituted children of
   God. "As many as received him, to them gave he the right to become
   children of God... which were born... of God." (John 1:12, 13).

   God is not out to reform our life. It is not His thought to bring it to
   a certain stage of refinement, for it is on a totally wrong plane. On
   that plane He cannot now bring man to glory. He must have a new man;
   one born anew, born of God. Regeneration and justification go together.
     __________________________________________________________________

He That Hath The Son Hath The Life

   There are various planes of life. Human life lies between the life of
   the lower animals and the life of God. We cannot bridge the gulf that
   divides us from the plane above or the plane below, and the distance
   that separates us from the life of God is vastly greater than that
   which separates us from the life of the lower animals.

   In China one day I called on a Christian leader who was sick in bed,
   and whom, for the sake of this story, I shall call Mr. Wong' (though
   that was not his real name). He was a very learned man, a Doctor of
   Philosophy, and one esteemed throughout the whole of China for his high
   moral principles, and he had long been engaged in Christian work. But
   he did not believe in the need for regeneration; he only proclaimed a
   social gospel.

   When I called on Mr. Wong his pet dog was by his bedside, and after
   speaking with him of the things of God and of the nature of His work in
   us, I pointed to the dog and inquired his name. He told me he was
   called Fido. Is Fido his Christian name or his surname?' I asked (using
   the common Chinese terms for personal name' and family name'). Oh, that
   is just his name', he said. Do you mean that is just his Christian
   name? Can I call him Fido Wong?' I continued. Certainly not!' came the
   emphatic reply. But he lives in your family', I protested, Why don't
   you call him Fido Wong?' Then, indicating his two daughters, I asked
   Are your daughters not called Miss Wong?' Yes!' Well then, why cannot I
   call your dog Master Wong?' The Doctor laughed, and I went on: Do you
   see what I am getting at? Your daughters were born into your family and
   they bear your name because you have communicated your life to them.
   Your dog may be an intelligent dog, a well-behaved dog, and altogether
   a most remarkable dog; but the question is not, Is he a good or a bad
   dog? It is merely, Is he a dog? He does not need to be bad to be
   disqualified from being a member of your family; he only needs to be a
   dog. The same principle applies to you in your relationship to God. The
   question is not whether you are a bad man or a good man, more or less,
   but simply, Are you a man? If your life is on a lower plane than that
   of God's life, then you cannot belong to the Divine family. Throughout
   your life your aim in preaching has been to turn bad men into good men;
   but men as such, whether good or bad, can have no vital relationship
   with God. Our only hope as men is to receive the Son of God, and when
   we do so His life in us will constitute us sons of God.' The Doctor saw
   the truth, and that day he became a member of God's family by receiving
   the Son of God into his heart.

   What we today possess in Christ is more than Adam lost. Adam was only a
   developed man. He remained on that plane, and never possessed the life
   of God. But we who receive the Son of God not only receive the
   forgiveness of sins; we receive also the Divine life which was
   represented in the garden by the tree of life. By the new birth we
   receive something Adam never had; we possess what he missed.
     __________________________________________________________________

They Are All Of One

   God wants sons who shall be joint-heirs with Christ in glory. That is
   His goal; but how can He bring that about? Turn now to Hebrews 2:10 and
   11: "It became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings. For both he that sanctifieth and
   they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not
   ashamed to call them brethren."

   There are two parties mentioned here, namely, "many sons" and "the
   author of their salvation", or, in different terms, "he that
   sanctifieth" and "they that are sanctified". But these two parties are
   said to be "all of one". The Lord Jesus as Man derived His life from
   God, and (in another sense, but just as truly) we derive our new life
   from God. He was "begotten... of the Holy Ghost" (Matthew 1:20 mg.),
   and we were "born of... the spirit", "born... of God" (John 3:5; 1:13).
   So, God says, we are all of One. "Of" in the Greek means "out of". The
   first begotten Son and the many sons are all (though in different
   senses) "out of" the one Source of life. Do you realize that we have
   the same life today that God has? The life which He has in Heaven is
   the life which He has imparted to us here on the earth. That is the
   precious "gift of God" (Rom. 6:23). It is for that reason that we can
   live a life of holiness, for it is not our own life that has been
   changed, but the life of God that has been imparted to us.

   Do you notice that, in this consideration of the eternal purpose, the
   whole question of sin ultimately goes out? It no longer has a place.
   Sin came in with Adam, and even when it has been dealt with, as it has
   to be, we are only brought back to the point where Adam was. But in
   relating us again to the Divine purpose--in, as it were, restoring to
   us access to the tree of life--redemption has given us far more than
   Adam ever had. It has made us partakers of the very life of God
   Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8: The Holy Spirit

   We have spoken of the eternal purpose of God as the motive and
   explanation of all His dealings with us. Now, before we return to our
   study of the phases of Christian experience as set forth in Romans, we
   must digress yet again in order to consider something which lies at the
   heart of all our experience as the vitalizing power of effective life
   and service. I refer to the personal presence and ministry of the Holy
   Spirit of God.

   And here, too, let us take as our starting-point two verses from
   Romans, one from each of our sections. "The love of God hath been shed
   abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost which was given unto us"
   (Romans 5:5). "If any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
   his" (Romans 8:9).

   God does not give His gifts at random, nor dispense them in any
   arbitrary fashion. They are given freely to all, but they are given on
   a definite basis. God has truly "blessed us with every spiritual
   blessing in the heavenly places in Christ" (Ephesians 1:3), but if
   those blessings which are ours in Christ are to become ours in
   experience, we must know on what ground we can appropriate them.

   In considering the gift of the Holy Spirit it is helpful to think of
   this in two aspects, as the Spirit outpoured and the Spirit indwelling,
   and our purpose now is to understand on what basis this twofold gift of
   the Holy Spirit becomes ours. I have no doubt that we are right in
   distinguishing thus between the outward and the inward manifestations
   of His working, and that as we go on we shall find the distinction
   helpful. Moreover, when we compare them, we cannot but come to the
   conclusion that the inward activity of the Holy Spirit is the more
   precious. But to say this is not for one moment to imply that His
   outward activity is not also precious, for God only gives good gifts to
   His children. Unfortunately we are apt to esteem our privileges lightly
   because of their sheer abundance. The Old Testament saints, who were
   not as favoured as we are, could appreciate more readily than we do the
   preciousness of this gift of the outpoured Spirit. In their day it was
   a gift given only to the select few--chiefly to priests, judges, kings
   and prophets--whereas now it is the portion of every child of God.
   Think! we who are mere nonentities can have the same Spirit resting
   upon us as rested upon Moses the friend of God, upon David the beloved
   king, and upon Elijah the mighty prophet. By receiving the gift of the
   outpoured Holy Spirit we join the ranks of God's chosen servants of the
   Old Testament dispensation. Once we see the value of this gift of God,
   and realize too our deep need of it, we shall immediately ask, How can
   I receive the Holy Spirit in this way to equip me with spiritual gifts
   and to empower me for service? Upon what basis has the Spirit been
   given?
     __________________________________________________________________

The Spirit Outpoured

   Let us turn first to Acts chapter 2 verses 32 to 36: "(32) This Jesus
   did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses. (33) Being therefore by
   the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the
   promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and
   hear. (34) For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith
   himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand, (35)
   Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.(36) Let all the
   house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both
   Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified."

   Let us for the moment set verses 34 and 35 aside and consider verses 33
   and 36 together. The former are a quotation from the 110th Psalm and
   are really a parenthesis, so we shall get the force of Peter's argument
   better if we ignore them for the time being. In verse 33 Peter states
   that the Lord Jesus was exalted "at the right hand of God" (mg.). What
   was the result? He "received of the Father the promise of the Holy
   Ghost". And what followed? Pentecost! The result of His exaltation
   was--"this, which ye see and hear".

   What, then, was the basis upon which the Spirit was first given to the
   Lord Jesus to be poured out upon His people? It was His exaltation to
   Heaven. This passage makes it absolutely clear that the Holy Spirit was
   poured out because the Lord Jesus was exalted. The outpouring of the
   Spirit has no relation to your merits or mine, but only to the merits
   of the Lord Jesus. The question of what we are does not come into
   consideration at all here, but only what He is. He is glorified;
   therefore the Spirit is poured out.

   Because the Lord Jesus died on the Cross, I have received forgiveness
   of sins; because the Lord Jesus rose from the dead, I have received new
   life; because the Lord Jesus has been exalted to the right hand of the
   Father, I have received the outpoured Spirit. All is because of Him;
   nothing is because of me. Remission of sins is not based on human
   merit, but on the Lord's crucifixion; regeneration is not based on
   human merit, but on the Lord's resurrection; and the enduement with the
   Holy Spirit is not based on human merit, but on the Lord's exaltation.
   The Holy Spirit has not been poured out on you or me to prove how great
   we are, but to prove the greatness of the Son of God.

   Now look at verse 36. There is a word here which demands our careful
   attention: the word therefore'. How is this word generally used? Not to
   introduce a statement, but to follow a statement that has already been
   made. Its use always implies that something has been mentioned before.
   Now what has preceded this particular therefore'? With what is it
   connected? It cannot reasonably be connected with either verse 34 or
   verse 35, but it quite obviously relates back to verse 33. Peter has
   just referred to the outpouring of the Spirit upon the disciples "which
   ye see and hear", and he says: "Let all the house of Israel therefore
   know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus
   whom ye crucified". Peter says, in effect, to his audience: This
   outpouring of the Spirit, which you have witnessed with your own eyes
   and ears, proves that Jesus of Nazareth whom ye crucified is now both
   Lord and Christ'. The Holy Spirit was poured out on earth to prove what
   had taken place in Heaven--the exaltation of Jesus of Nazareth to the
   right hand of God. The purpose of Pentecost is to prove the Lordship of
   Jesus Christ.

   There was a young man named Joseph, who was dearly loved of his father.
   One day news reached the father of the death of his son, and for years
   Jacob lamented Joseph's loss. But Joseph was not in the grave; he was
   in a place of glory and power. After Jacob had been mourning the death
   of his son for years, it was suddenly reported to him that Joseph was
   alive and in a high position in Egypt. At first Jacob could not take it
   in. It was too good to be true. But ultimately he was persuaded that
   the story of Joseph's exaltation was really a fact. How did he come to
   believe in it? He went out, and saw the chariots that Joseph had sent
   from Egypt.

   What do the chariots represent here? They surely typify here the Holy
   Spirit, sent both to be the evidence that God's Son is in glory and to
   convey us there. How do we know that Jesus of Nazareth, who was
   crucified by wicked men nearly two thousand years ago, did not just die
   a martyr's death but is at the Father's right hand in glory? How can we
   know for a surety that He is Lord of lords and King of kings? We can
   know it beyond dispute because He has poured out His Spirit upon us.
   Hallelujah! Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Christ! Jesus of Nazareth is both
   Lord and Christ!

   The exaltation of the Lord Jesus is the basis on which the Spirit has
   been given. Is it possible then that the Lord has been glorified and
   you have not received the Spirit? On what basis did you receive
   forgiveness of sins? Was it because you prayed so earnestly, or because
   you read your Bible from cover to cover, or because of your regular
   attendance at Church? Was it because of your merits at all? No! A
   thousand times, No! On what ground then were your sins forgiven? "Apart
   from shedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22). The sole
   ground of forgiveness is the shedding of blood; and since the precious
   Blood has been shed, your sins have been forgiven.

   Now the principle on which we receive the enduement of the Holy Spirit
   is the very same as that on which we receive forgiveness of sins. The
   Lord has been crucified, therefore our sins have been forgiven; the
   Lord has been glorified, therefore the Spirit has been poured out upon
   us. Is it possible that the Son of God shed His Blood and that your
   sins, dear child of God, have not been forgiven? Never! Then is it
   possible that the Son of God has been glorified and you have not
   received the Spirit? Never!

   Some of you may say: I agree with all this, but I have no experience of
   it. Am I to sit down smugly and say I have everything, when I know
   perfectly well I have nothing? No, we must never rest content with
   objective facts alone. We need subjective experience also; but that
   experience will only come as we rest upon Divine facts. God's facts are
   the basis of our experience.

   Let us go back again to the question of justification. How were you
   justified? Not by doing anything at all, but by accepting the fact that
   the Lord had done everything. Enduement with the Holy Spirit becomes
   yours in exactly the same way as justification, not by your doing
   anything yourself, but by your putting your faith in what the Lord has
   already done.

   If we lack the experience, we must ask God for a revelation of the
   eternal fact of the baptism of the Holy Spirit as the gift of the
   exalted Lord to His Church. Once we see that, effort will cease, and
   prayer will give place to praise. It was a revelation of what the Lord
   had done for the world that brought to an end our efforts to secure
   forgiveness of sins, and it is a revelation of what the Lord has done
   for His Church that will bring to an end our efforts to secure the
   baptism of the Holy Spirit. We work because we have not seen the work
   of Christ. But when once we have seen that, faith will spring up in our
   hearts, and as we believe, experience will follow.

   Some time ago a young man, who had only been a Christian for five weeks
   and who had formerly been violently opposed to the gospel, attended a
   series of meetings which I was addressing in Shanghai. At the close of
   one in which I was speaking along the above lines, he went home and
   began to pray earnestly, Lord, I do want the power of the Holy Spirit.
   Seeing Thou hast now been glorified, wilt Thou not now pour out Thy
   Spirit upon me?' Then he corrected himself: Oh no, Lord, that's all
   wrong!' and began to pray again: Lord Jesus, we are in a
   life-partnership, Thou and I, and the Father has promised us two
   things--glory for Thee, and the Spirit for me. Thou, Lord, hast
   received the glory; therefore it is unthinkable that I have not
   received the Spirit. Lord, I praise Thee! Thou hast already received
   the glory, and I have already received the Spirit.' From that day the
   power of the Spirit was consciously upon him.
     __________________________________________________________________

Faith Is Again The Key

   As for forgiveness, so equally for the coming upon us of the Holy
   Spirit, the whole question is one of faith. As soon as we see the Lord
   Jesus on the Cross, we know our sins are forgiven; and as soon as we
   see the Lord Jesus on the Throne, we know the Holy Spirit has been
   poured out upon us. The basis upon which we receive the enduement of
   the Holy Spirit is not our praying and fasting and waiting, but the
   exaltation of Christ. Those who emphasize tarrying and hold tarrying
   meetings' only mislead us, for the gift is not for the favoured few'
   but for all, because it is not given on the ground of what we are at
   all, but of what Christ is. The Spirit has been poured out to prove His
   goodness and greatness, not ours. Christ has been crucified, therefore
   we have been forgiven: Christ has been glorified, therefore we have
   been endued with power from on high. It is all because of Him.

   Suppose an unbeliever expresses the desire to be saved, and you explain
   to him the way of salvation and pray with him. Suppose then he prays
   after this fashion: Lord Jesus, I believe Thou hast died for me, and
   that Thou canst blot out all my sins. I truly believe Thou wilt forgive
   me.' Have you any confidence that that man is saved? When will you rest
   assured that he has really been born again? Not when he prays: Lord, I
   believe Thou wilt forgive my sins', but when he says: Lord, I praise
   Thee that Thou hast forgiven my sins. Thou hast died for me; therefore
   my sins are blotted out' You believe a person is saved when prayer
   turns to praise--when he ceases to ask the Lord to forgive him, but
   praises Him that He has already done so because the Blood of the Lamb
   has already been shed.

   In the same way, you can pray and wait for years and never experience
   the Spirit's power; but when you cease to plead with the Lord to pour
   out His Spirit upon you, and when instead you trustfully praise Him
   that the Spirit has been poured out because the Lord Jesus has been
   glorified, you will find that your problem is solved. Praise God! no
   single child of His need agonize, nor even wait, for the Spirit to be
   given. Jesus is not going to be made Lord; He is Lord. Therefore I am
   not going to receive the Spirit; I have received the Spirit. It is all
   a question of the faith which comes by revelation. When our eyes are
   opened to see that the Spirit has already been poured out because Jesus
   has already been glorified, then prayer turns to praise in our hearts.

   All spiritual blessings are given on a definite basis. God's gifts are
   freely given, but there are conditions which must be fulfilled on our
   part before the reception of them is possible. There is a passage in
   God's Word which makes the conditions of the outpoured Spirit perfectly
   clear: "Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
   Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the
   gift of the Holy Ghost. For to you is the promise, and to your
   children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our
   God shall call unto him" (Acts 2:38, 39).

   Four things are mentioned in this passage: Repentance, Baptism,
   Forgiveness, and the Holy Spirit. The first two are conditions, the
   second two are gifts. What are the conditions to be fulfilled if we are
   to have forgiveness of sins? According to the Word they are two:
   repentance and baptism.

   The first condition is repentance, which means a change of mind.
   Formerly I thought sin a pleasant thing, but now I have changed my mind
   about it; formerly I thought the world an attractive place, but now I
   know better; formerly I regarded it a miserable business to be a
   Christian, but now I think differently. Once I thought certain things
   delightful, now I think them vile; once I thought other things utterly
   worthless, now I think them most precious. That is a change of mind,
   and that is repentance. No life can be truly changed apart from such a
   change of mind.

   The second condition is baptism. Baptism is an outward expression of an
   inward faith. When in my heart I truly believe that I have died with
   Christ, have been buried and have risen with Him, then I ask for
   baptism. I thereby declare publicly what I believe privately. Baptism
   is faith in action.

   Here then are two divinely appointed conditions of
   forgiveness--repentance, and faith publicly expressed. Have you
   repented? Have you testified publicly to your union with your Lord?
   Then have you received remission of sins and the gift of the Holy
   Ghost? You say you have only received the first gift, not the second.
   But, my friend, God offered you two things if you fulfilled two
   conditions! Why have you only taken one? What are you doing about the
   second?

   Suppose I went into a book-shop, selected a two-volume book, priced at
   ten shillings, and, having put down a ten-shilling note, walked out of
   the shop, carelessly leaving one volume on the counter. When I reached
   home and discovered the oversight, what do you think I should do? I
   should go straight back to the shop to get the forgotten book, but I
   should not dream of paying anything for it. I should simply explain to
   the shopkeeper that both volumes were duly paid for, and ask him if he
   would therefore kindly let me have the second one; and without any
   further payment I should march happily out of the shop with my
   possession under my arm. Would you not do the same under the same
   circumstances?

   But you are under the same circumstances. If you have fulfilled the
   conditions you are entitled to two gifts, not just one. You have
   already taken the one; why not just come and take the other now? Say to
   the Lord, Lord, I have complied with the conditions for receiving
   remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost, but I have foolishly
   only taken the former. Now I have come back to take the gift of the
   Holy Ghost, and I praise Thee for it.'
     __________________________________________________________________

The Diversity Of The Experience

   But you ask: How shall I know that the Holy Spirit is come upon me?' I
   cannot tell how you will know, but you will know. No description has
   been given us of the personal sensations and emotions of the disciples
   at Pentecost. We do not know exactly how they felt, but we do know that
   their feelings and behaviour were somewhat abnormal, because people
   seeing them said they were intoxicated. When the Holy Spirit falls upon
   God's people there will be some things which the world cannot account
   for. There will be supernatural accompaniments of some kind, though it
   be no more than an overwhelming sense of the Divine Presence. We cannot
   and we must not stipulate what particular form such outward expressions
   will take in any given case, but one thing is sure, that each one upon
   whom the Spirit of God falls will know it.

   When the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples at Pentecost there was
   something quite extraordinary about their behaviour, and Peter offered
   an explanation from God's Word to all who witnessed it. This, in
   substance, is what he said: When the Holy Spirit falls upon believers,
   some will prophesy, some will dream dreams, and others will see
   visions. This is what God has stated through the prophet Joel.' But did
   Peter prophesy? Well, hardly in the sense in which Joel meant it. Did
   the hundred and twenty prophesy or see visions? We are not told that
   they did. Did they dream dreams? How could they, for were they not all
   wide awake? Well then, what did Peter mean by using a quotation that
   seems scarcely to fit the case at all? In the passage quoted (Joel
   2:28, 29), prophesy, dreams and visions are said to accompany the
   outpouring of the Spirit, yet these evidences were apparently lacking
   at Pentecost.

   On the other hand, Joel's prophecy said not a word about "a sound as of
   the rushing of a mighty wind", nor about "tongues parting asunder like
   as of fire" as accompaniments of the Spirit's outpouring; yet these
   were manifest in that upper room. And where in Joel do we find mention
   of speaking in other tongues? And yet the disciples at Pentecost did
   so.

   What did Peter mean? Imagine him quoting God's Word to show that the
   experience of Pentecost was the outpouring of the Spirit spoken of by
   Joel, without a single one of the evidences mentioned by Joel being
   found at Pentecost. What the Book mentioned the disciples lacked, and
   what the disciples had the Book did not mention! It looks as though
   Peter's quotation of the Book disproves his point rather than proving
   it. What is the explanation of this mystery?

   Let us recall that Peter was himself speaking under the control of the
   Holy Spirit. The Book of the Acts was written by the Spirit's
   inspiration, and not one word was spoken at random. There is no misfit,
   but a perfect harmony. Note carefully that Peter did not say: What you
   see and hear fulfills what was spoken by the prophet Joel'. What he
   said was: "This is that which hath been spoken by the prophet Joel"
   (Acts 2:16). It was not a case of fulfillment, but of an experience of
   the same order. "This is that" means that this which you see and hear
   is of the same order as that which is foretold'. When it is a case of
   fulfillment, each experience is reduplicated and prophecy is prophecy,
   dreams are dreams, and visions are visions; but when Peter says "This
   is that", it is not a question of the one being a replica of the other,
   but of the one belonging to the same category as the other. "This"
   amounts to the same thing as "that"; "this" is the equivalent of
   "that"; "this is that". What is being emphasized by the Holy Spirit
   through Peter is the diversity of the experience. The outward evidences
   may be many and varied, and we have to admit that occasionally they are
   strange; but the Spirit is one, and He is Lord. (See Corinthians
   12:4-6).

   What happened to R.A. Torrey when the Holy Spirit came upon him after
   he had been a minister for years? Let him tell it in his own words: I
   recall the exact spot where I was kneeling in prayer in my study... It
   was very quiet moment, one of the most quiet moments I ever knew...
   Then God simply said to me, not in any audible voice, but in my heart.
   "It's yours. Now go and preach." He had already said it to me in His
   Word in 1 John 5:14, 15; but I did not then know my Bible as I know it
   now, and God had pity on my ignorance and said it directly to my
   soul... I went and preached, and I have been a new minister from that
   day to this... Some time after this experience (I do not recall just
   how long after), while sitting in my room one day... suddenly... I
   found myself shouting (I was not brought up to shout and I am not of a
   shouting temperament, but I shouted like the loudest shouting
   Methodist), "Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God", and I could not
   stop. ... But that was not when I was baptized with the Holy Spirit. I
   was baptized with the Holy Spirit when I took Him by simple faith in
   The Word of God.' [10]

   The outward manifestations in Torrey's case were not the same as those
   described by Joel or by Peter, but "this is that". It is not a
   facsimile, yet it is the same thing.

   And how did D.L. Moody feel and act when the Spirit came upon him?

   I was crying all the time that God would fill me with His Spirit. Well,
   one day, in the city of New York--oh, what a day!--I cannot describe
   it, I seldom refer to it; it is almost too sacred an experience to
   name. Paul had an experience of which he never spoke for fourteen
   years. I can only say that God revealed Himself to me, and I had such
   an experience of His love that I had to ask Him to stay His hand. I
   went preaching again. The sermons were not different; I did not present
   any new truths; and yet hundreds were converted. I would not now be
   placed back where I was before that blessed experience if you should
   give me all the world - it would be as the small dust of the balance.'
   [11]

   The outward manifestation that accompanied Moody's experience did not
   tally exactly with Joel's description, or Peter's, or Torrey's, but who
   could doubt that "this" which Moody experienced was "that" experienced
   by the disciples at Pentecost? It was not the same in manifestation,
   but it was the very same in essence.

   And what was the experience of the great Charles Finney when the power
   of the Holy Ghost came upon him?

   I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost without any expectation
   of it, without ever having the thought in my mind that there was any
   such thing for me, without any recollection that I had ever heard the
   thing mentioned by any person in the world, the Holy Spirit descended
   upon me in a manner that seemed to go through me body and soul. No
   words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in my heart.
   I wept aloud with joy and love.' [12]

   Finney's experience was not a duplicate of Pentecost, nor of Torrey's
   experience, nor of Moody's; but "this" certainly was "that".

   When the Holy Spirit is poured out upon God's people their experiences
   will differ widely. Some will receive new vision, others will know a
   new liberty in soul-winning, others will proclaim the Word of God with
   power, and yet others will be filled with heavenly joy or overflowing
   praise. "This... and this... and this... is that!" Let us praise the
   Lord for every new experience that relates to the exaltation of Christ
   and of which it can truly be said that "this" is an evidence of "that".
   There is nothing stereotyped about God's dealings with His children.
   Therefore we must not by our prejudices and preconceptions make a
   water-tight compartment for the working of His Spirit, either in our
   own lives or in the lives of others. This applies equally to those who
   require some particular manifestation (such as speaking with tongues')
   as evidence that the spirit has come upon them and to those who deny
   that any manifestation is given at all. We must leave God free to work
   as He wills, and to give what evidence He pleases of the work He does.
   He is Lord, and it is not for us to legislate for Him.

   Let us rejoice that Jesus is on the throne, and let us praise Him that,
   since He has been glorified, the Spirit has been poured out upon us
   all. As we accept the Divine fact in all the simplicity of faith, we
   shall know it with such assurance in our own experience that we shall
   dare to proclaim with confidence--"This is that!"

The Spirit Indwelling

   We move on now to the second aspect of the gift of the Holy Spirit,
   which, as we shall see in our next chapter, is more particularly the
   subject of Romans 8. It is that which we have spoken of as the Spirit
   indwelling. "If so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you..."
   (Romans 8:9). As with the Spirit outpoured, so with the Spirit
   indwelling, if we are to know in experience that which is ours in fact,
   our first need is of Divine revelation. When we see Christ as Lord
   objectively--that is, as exalted to the throne in Heaven--then we shall
   experience the power of the Spirit upon us. When we see Christ as Lord
   subjectively--that is, as effective Ruler within our lives--then we
   shall know the power of the Spirit within us.

   A revelation of the indwelling Spirit was the remedy Paul offered the
   Corinthian Christians for their unspirituality. It is important to note
   that the Christians in Corinth had become preoccupied with the visible
   signs of the Holy Spirit's outpouring and were making much of tongues'
   and miracles, while at the same time their lives were full of
   contradictions and were a reproach to the Lord's Name. They had quite
   evidently received the Holy Spirit and yet they remained spiritually
   immature; and the remedy God offered them for this is the remedy He
   offers His Church today for the same complaint.

   In his letter to them Paul wrote: "Know ye not that ye are a temple of
   God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" (1 Corinthians 3:16).
   For others he prayed for enlightenment of heart, "...that ye may know"
   (Ephesians 1:18). A knowledge of Divine facts was the need of the
   Christians then, and it is no less the need of Christians today. We
   need the opening of the eyes of our understanding' that we may know
   that God Himself through the Holy Spirit has taken up His abode in our
   hearts. God is present in the person of the Spirit, and Christ is
   present in the person of the Spirit too. Thus if the Holy Spirit dwells
   in our hearts we have the Father and the Son dwelling within. That is
   no mere theory or doctrine, but a blessed reality. We may perhaps have
   realized that the Spirit is actually within our hearts, but have we
   realized that He is a Person? Have we understood that to have the
   Spirit within us it to have the living God within?

   To many Christians the Holy Spirit is quite unreal. They regard Him as
   a mere influence--and influence for good, no doubt, but just an
   influence for all that. In their thinking, conscience and the Spirit
   are more or less identified as some thing' within them that brings them
   to book when they are bad and tries to show them how to be good. The
   trouble with the Corinthian Christians was not that they lacked the
   indwelling Spirit but that they lacked the knowledge of His presence.
   They failed to realize the greatness of the One who had come to make
   His abode in their hearts; so Paul wrote to them: "Know ye not that ye
   are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" Yes,
   that was the remedy for their unspirituality--just to know who He
   really was who dwelt within.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Treasure In The Vessel

   Do you know, my friends, that the Spirit within you is very God? Oh
   that our eyes were opened to see the greatness of God's gift! Oh that
   we might realize the vastness of the resources secreted in our own
   hearts! I could shout with joy as I think, The Spirit who dwells within
   me is no mere influence, but a living Person; He is very God. The
   infinite God is within my heart!' I am at a loss to convey to you the
   blessedness of this discovery, that the Holy Spirit dwelling within my
   heart is a Person. I can only repeat: He is a Person!' and repeat it
   again: He is a Person!' and repeat it yet again: He is a Person!' Oh,
   my friends, I would fain repeat it to you a hundred times--The Spirit
   of God within me is a Person! I am only an earthen vessel, but in that
   earthen vessel I carry a treasure of unspeakable worth, even the Lord
   of glory.

   All the worry and fret of God's children would end if their eyes were
   opened to see the greatness of the treasure hid in their hearts. Do you
   know, there are resources enough in your own heart to meet the demand
   of every circumstance in which you will ever find yourself? Do you know
   there is power enough there to move the city in which you live? Do you
   know there is power enough to shake the universe? Let me tell you once
   more--I say it with the utmost reverence: You who have been born again
   of the Spirit of God--you carry God in your heart!

   All the flippancy of the children of God would cease too if they
   realized the greatness of the treasure deposited within them. If you
   have only ten shillings in your pocket you can march gaily along the
   street, talking lightly as you go, and swinging your stick in the air.
   It matters little if you lose your money, for there is not much at
   stake. But if you carry a thousand pounds in your pocket, the position
   is vastly different, and your whole demeanour will be different too.
   There will be great gladness in your heart, but no careless jaunting
   along the road; and once in a while you will slacken your pace and,
   slipping your hand into your pocket, you will quietly finger your
   treasure again, and then with joyful solemnity continue on your way.

   In Old Testament times there were hundreds of tents in the camp of
   Israel, but there was one tent quite different from all the rest. In
   the common tents you could do just as you pleased--eat or fast, work or
   rest, be joyful or sober, noisy or silent. But that other tent was a
   tent that commanded reverence and awe. You might move in and out of the
   common tents talking noisily and laughing gaily, but as soon as you
   neared that special tent you instinctively walked more quietly, and
   when you stood right before it you bowed your head in solemn silence.
   No one could touch it with impunity. If man or beast dared to do so,
   death was the sure penalty. What was so very special about it? It was
   the temple of the living God. There was little unusual about the tent
   itself, for it was outwardly of very ordinary material, but the great
   God had chosen to make it His abode.

   Do you realize what happened at your conversion? God came into your
   heart and made it His temple. In Old Testament days God dwelt in a
   temple made of stone; today He dwells in a temple composed of living
   believers. When we really see that God has made our hearts His dwelling
   place, what a deep reverence will come over our lives! All lightness,
   all frivolity will end, and all self-pleasing too, when we know that we
   are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells within us. Has
   it really come to you that wherever you go you carry with you the Holy
   Spirit of God? You do not just carry your Bible with you, or even much
   good teaching about God, but God Himself.

   The reason why many Christians do not experience the power of the
   Spirit, though He actually dwells in their hearts, is that they lack
   reverence. And they lack reverence because they have not had their eyes
   opened to the fact of His presence. The fact is there, but they have
   not seen it. Why is it that some Christians are living victorious lives
   while others live in a state of constant defeat? The difference is not
   accounted for by the presence or absence of the Spirit (for He dwells
   in the heart of every child of God) but by this, that some recognize
   His indwelling and others do not. True revelation of the fact of the
   Spirit's indwelling will revolutionize the life of any Christian.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Absolute Lordship Of Christ

   "Know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
   you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own; for ye were
   bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body" (1 Cor. 6:19,
   20).

   This verse now takes us a stage further, for, when once we have made
   the discovery of the fact that we are the dwelling place of God, then a
   full surrender of ourselves to God must follow. When we see that we are
   the temple of God we shall immediately recognize that we are not our
   own. Consecration will follow revelation. The difference between
   victorious Christians and defeated ones is not that some have the
   Spirit while others have not, but that some know His indwelling and
   others do not, and that consequently some recognize the Divine
   ownership of their lives while others are still their own masters.

   Revelation is the first step to holiness, and consecration is the
   second. A day must come in our lives, as definite as the day of our
   conversion, when we give up all right to ourselves and submit to the
   absolute Lordship of Jesus Christ. There may be a practical issue
   raised by God to test the reality of our consecration, but whether that
   be so or not, there must be a day when, without reservation, we
   surrender everything to Him--ourselves, our families, our possessions,
   our business and our time. All we are and have becomes His, to be held
   henceforth entirely at His disposal. From that day we are no longer our
   own masters, but only stewards. Not until the Lordship of Jesus Christ
   is a settled thing in our hearts can the Spirit really operate
   effectively in us. He cannot direct our lives effectually until all
   control of them is committed to Him. If we do not give Him absolute
   authority in our lives, He can be present, but He cannot be powerful.
   The power of the Spirit is stayed.

   Are you living for the Lord or for yourself? Perhaps that is too
   general a question, so let me be more specific. Is there anything God
   is asking of you that you are withholding from Him? Is there any point
   of contention between you and Him? Not till every controversy is
   settled and the Holy Spirit is given full sway can He reproduce the
   life of Christ in the heart of any believer.

   An American friend, now with the Lord, whose name we will call Paul,
   cherished the hope from his early youth that one day he would be called
   Dr. Paul'. When he was quite a little chap he began to dream of the day
   when he would enter the university, and he imagined himself first
   studying for his M.A. degree and then for his Ph.D. Then at length the
   glad day would arrive when all would greet him as Dr. Paul'.

   The Lord saved him and called him to preach, and before long he became
   pastor of a large congregation. By that time he had his degree and was
   studying for his doctorate, but, despite splendid progress in his
   studies and a good measure of success as a pastor, he was a very
   dissatisfied man. He was a Christian, but his life was not Christ-like;
   he had the Spirit of God within him, but he did not enjoy the Spirit's
   presence or experience His power. He thought to himself, I am a
   preacher of the Gospel and the pastor of a church. I tell my people
   they should love the Word of God, but I do not really love it myself. I
   exhort them to pray, but I myself have little inclination to pray. I
   tell them to live a holy life, but my own life is not holy. I warn them
   not to love the world, and, though outwardly I shun it, yet in my heart
   I myself still love it dearly.' In his distress he cried to the Lord to
   cause him to know the power of the indwelling Spirit, but though he
   prayed and prayed for months, no answer came. Then he fasted and
   besought the Lord to show him any hindrance there might be in his life.
   That answer was not long in coming, and it was this: I long that you
   should know the power of My Spirit, but your heart is set on something
   that I do not wish you to have. You have yielded to me all but one
   thing, and that one thing you are holding to yourself--your Ph.D.'
   Well, to you or me it might be of little consequence whether we were
   addressed as plain Mr. Paul' or as Dr. Paul', but to him it was his
   very life. He had dreamed of it from childhood and labored for it all
   through his youth, and now the thing he prized above all was almost
   within his grasp. In two short months it would be his.

   So he reasoned with the Lord in this wise: Is there any harm for me to
   be a Doctor of Philosophy? Will it not bring much more glory to Thy
   Name to have a Dr. Paul preaching the Gospel than a plain Mr. Paul?'
   But God does not change His mind, and all Mr. Paul's sound reasoning
   did not alter the Lord's word to him. Every time he prayed about the
   matter he got the same answer. Then, reasoning having failed, he
   resorted to bargaining with the Lord. He promised to go here or there,
   to do this or that, if only the Lord would allow him to have his
   doctor's degree; but still the Lord did not change His mind. And all
   the while Mr. Paul was becoming more and more hungry to know the
   fullness of the Spirit. This state of affairs continued to within two
   days of his final examination.

   It was Saturday, and Mr. Paul settled down to prepare his sermon for
   the following day, but, study as he would, he could get no message. The
   ambition of a lifetime was just within reach of realization, but God
   made it clear that he must choose between the power he could sway
   through a doctor's degree and the power of God's Spirit swaying his
   life. That evening he yielded. Lord', he said, I am willing to be plain
   Mr. Paul all my days, but I want to know the power of the Holy Ghost in
   my life.'

   He rose from his knees and wrote a letter to his examiners, asking to
   be excused from the examination on the Monday, and giving his reason.
   Then he retired, very happy, but not conscious of any unusual
   experience. Next morning he told his congregation that for the first
   time in six years he had no sermon to preach, and explained how it came
   about. The Lord blessed that testimony more abundantly than any of his
   well-prepared sermons, and from that time God blessed and owned him in
   an altogether new way. From that day he knew separation from the world,
   no longer as an outward thing but as a deep inward reality, and in
   daily experience he knew the blessedness of the Spirit's presence and
   power.

   God is waiting for a settlement of all our controversies with Him. With
   Mr. Paul it was a question of his doctor's degree, but with us it may
   be something quite different. Our absolute surrender of ourselves to
   the Lord generally hinges upon some one particular thing, and God is
   after that one thing. He must have it, for He must have our all. I was
   greatly impressed by something a great national leader wrote in his
   autobiography: I want nothing for myself; I want everything for my
   country.' If a man can be willing that his country should have
   everything and he himself nothing, cannot we say to our God: Lord, I
   want nothing for myself; I want all for Thee. I will what Thou willest,
   and I want to have nothing outside Thy will.' Not until we take the
   place of a servant can He take His place as Lord. He is not calling us
   to devote ourselves to His cause: He is asking us to yield ourselves to
   His will. Are you willing for anything He wills?

   Another friend of mine, like my friend Mr. Paul, had a controversy with
   the Lord. before his conversion he fell in love, and as soon as he was
   saved he sought to win the one he loved to the Lord, but she would have
   nothing to do with spiritual things. the Lord made it clear to him that
   his relations with that girl must be broken off, but he was deeply
   devoted to her, so he evaded the issue and continued to serve the Lord
   and to win souls for Him. But he became conscious of his need for
   holiness, and that consciousness marked the beginning of dark days for
   him. He asked for the Spirit's fullness that he might have power to
   live a holy life, but the Lord seemed continually to ignore his
   request.

   One morning he had to preach in another city and he spoke from Psalm
   73:25: "Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth
   that I desire beside thee." On his return home he went to a prayer
   meeting, and there a sister read out the very same verse from which,
   unknown to her, he had just preached, and followed it with the
   question: Can we truly say: "There is none upon earth that I desire
   beside thee"?' There was power in that word. It struck right home to
   his heart and he had to admit to himself that he could not truthfully
   say that he desired no one in Heaven or earth apart from his Lord. He
   saw, there and then, that for him everything hinged upon his
   willingness to give up the girl he loved.

   For some it might not have involved much, but for him it was
   everything. So he began to reason with the Lord: Lord I will go to
   Tibet and work for Thee there if I may marry that girl'. But the Lord
   seemed to care a great deal more about his relationship with that girl
   than about his going to Tibet, and no amount of reasoning on his part
   availed to effect any change of emphasis on the part of the Lord. The
   controversy went on for several months, and when again the young man
   pleaded for the fullness of the Spirit, the Lord still pointed to the
   same thing. But that day the Lord triumphed, and that young man looked
   up to Him and said: Lord, I can truly say now, "Whom have I in heaven
   but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee".' And
   that was the beginning of a new life for him.

   A forgiven sinner is quite different from an ordinary sinner, and a
   consecrated Christian is quite different from an ordinary Christian.
   May the Lord bring us to a definite issue regarding the question of His
   Lordship. If we do yield wholly to Him and claim the power of the
   indwelling Spirit, we need wait for no special feelings or supernatural
   manifestations, but can simply look up and praise Him that something
   has already happened. We can confidently thank Him that the glory of
   God has already filled His temple. "Know ye not that ye are the temple
   of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" "Know ye not that
   your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have
   from God?"

Chapter 9: The Meaning and Value of Romans Seven

   We must return now to our study of Romans. We broke off at the end of
   chapter 6 in order to consider two related subjects, namely, God's
   eternal purpose, which is the motive and goal of our walk with Him, and
   the Holy Spirit, who supplies the power and resource to bring us to
   that goal. We come now to Romans 7, a chapter which many have felt to
   be almost superfluous. Perhaps indeed it would be so if Christians
   really saw that the old creation has been ruled out by the Cross of
   Christ, and an entirely new creation brought in by His resurrection. If
   we have come to the point where we really know' that, and reckon' on
   that, and present ourselves' on the basis of that, then perhaps we have
   no need of Romans 7.

   Others have felt that the chapter is in the wrong place. They would
   have put it between the fifth and sixth chapters. After chapter 6 all
   is so perfect, so straightforward; and then comes breakdown and the
   cry, "O wretched man that I am!" Could anything be more of an
   anticlimax? And so some have argued that Paul is speaking here of his
   unregenerate experience. Well, we must admit that some of what he
   describes here is not a Christian experience, but none the less many
   Christians do experience it. What then is the teaching of this chapter?

   Romans 6 deals with freedom from sin. Romans 7 deals with freedom from
   the Law. In chapter 6 Paul has told us how we could be delivered from
   sin, and we concluded that this was all that was required. Chapter 7
   now teaches that deliverance from sin is not enough, but that we also
   need to know deliverance from the Law. If we are not fully emancipated
   from the Law we can never know full emancipation from sin. But what is
   the difference between deliverance from sin and deliverance from the
   Law? We all see the value of the former, but where is the need for the
   latter? Well, to appreciate this we must first understand what the Law
   is and what it does.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Flesh And Man's Breakdown

   Romans 7 has a new lesson to teach us. It is found in the discovery
   that I am "in the flesh" (Rom. 7:5), that "I am carnal" (7:18). This
   goes beyond the question of sin, for it relates also the matter of
   pleasing God. We are dealing here not with sin in its forms but with
   man in his carnal state. The latter includes the former but it takes us
   a stage further, for it leads to the discovery that in this realm too
   we are totally impotent, and that "they that are in the flesh cannot
   please God" (Rom. 8:8). How then is this discovery made? It is made
   with the help of the Law.

   Now let us retrace our steps for a minute and attempt to describe what
   is probably the experience of many. Many a Christian is truly saved and
   yet bound by sin. It is not that he is necessarily living under the
   power of sin all the time, but that there are certain particular sins
   hampering him continually so that he hears the full Gospel message,
   that the Lord Jesus not only died to cleanse away our sins, but that
   when He died He included us sinners in His death; so that not only were
   our sins dealt with, but we ourselves were dealt with too. The man's
   eyes are opened and he knows he has been crucified with Christ. Two
   things follow that revelation. In the first place he reckons that he
   has died and risen with the Lord, and in the second place, recognizing
   the Lord's claim upon him, he presents himself to God as alive from the
   dead. He sees that he has no more right over himself. This is the
   commencement of a beautiful Christian life, full of praise to the Lord.

   But then he begins to reason as follows: I have died with Christ and am
   raised with Him, and I have given myself over to Him for ever; now I
   must do something for Him, since He has done so much for me. I want to
   please Him and do His will.' So, after the step of consecration, he
   seeks to discover the will of God, and sets out to obey Him. Then he
   makes a strange discovery. He thought he could do the will of God and
   he thought he loved it, but gradually he finds he does not always like
   it. At times he even finds a distinct reluctance to do it, and often
   when he tries to do it he finds he cannot. Then he begins to question
   his experience. He asks himself: Did I really know? Yes! Did I really
   reckon? Yes! Did I really give myself to Him? Yes! Have I taken back my
   consecration? No! Then whatever is the matter now?' The more this man
   tries to do the will of God the more he fails. Ultimately he comes to
   the conclusion that he never really loved God's will at all, so he
   prays for the desire and the power to do it. He confesses his
   disobedience and promises never to disobey again. But he has barely got
   up from his knees before he has fallen once more; before he reaches the
   point of victory he is conscious of defeat. Then he says to himself:
   Perhaps my last decision was not definite enough. This time I will be
   absolutely definite.' So he brings all his will-power to bear on the
   situation, only to find greater defeat than ever awaiting him the next
   time a choice has to be made. Then at last he echoes the words of Paul:
   "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing:
   for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good is not.
   For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not,
   that I practice" (Rom. 7:18, 19).

What The Law Teaches

   Many Christians are suddenly launched into the experience of Romans 7
   and they do not know why. They fancy Romans 6 is quite enough. Having
   grasped that, they think there can be no more question of failure, and
   then to their utmost surprise they suddenly find themselves in Romans
   7. What is the explanation?

   First let us be quite clear that the death with Christ described in
   Romans 6 is fully adequate to cover all our need. It is the explanation
   of that death, with all that follows from it, that is incomplete in
   chapter 6. We are as yet still in ignorance of the truth set forth in
   chapter 7. Romans 7 is given to us to explain and make real the
   statement in Romans 6:14, that: "Sin shall not have dominion over you:
   for ye are not under law, but under grace." The trouble is that we do
   not yet know deliverance from law. What, then, is the meaning of law?

   Grace means that God does something for me; law means that I do
   something for God. God has certain holy and righteous demands which He
   places upon me: that is law. Now if law means that God requires
   something of me for their fulfillment, then deliverance from law means
   that He no longer requires that from me, but Himself provides it. Law
   implies that God requires me to do something for Him; deliverance from
   law implies that He exempts me from doing it, and that in grace He does
   it Himself. I (where I' is the carnal' man of ch. 7:14) need do nothing
   for God: that is deliverance from law. The trouble in Romans 7 is that
   man in the flesh tried to do something for God. As soon as you try to
   please God in that way, then you place yourself under law, and the
   experience of Romans 7 begins to be yours.

   As we seek to understand this, let it be settled at the outset that the
   fault does not lie with the Law. Paul says, "the law is holy, and the
   commandment holy, and righteous, and good" (Rom. 7:12). No, there is
   nothing wrong with the Law, but there is something decidedly wrong with
   me. The demands of the Law are righteous, but the person upon whom the
   demands are made is unrighteous. The trouble is not that the Law's
   demands are unjust, but that I am unable to meet them. It may be all
   right for the Government to require payment of 100 shillings but it
   will be all wrong if I have only ten shillings with which to meet the
   demand!

   I am a man "sold under sin" (Rom. 7:14). Sin has dominion over me. As
   long as you leave me alone I seem to be rather a fine type of man. It
   is when you ask me to do something that my sinfulness comes to light.

   If you have a very clumsy servant and he just sits still and does
   nothing, then his clumsiness does not appear. If he does nothing all
   day he will be of little use to you, it is true, but at least he will
   do no damage that way. But if you say to him: Now come along, don't
   idle away your time; get up and do something', then immediately the
   trouble begins. He knocks the chair over as he gets up, stumbles over a
   footstool a few paces further on, then smashes some precious dish as
   soon as he handles it. If you make no demands upon him his clumsiness
   is never noticed, but as soon as you ask him to do anything his
   awkwardness is seen at once. The demands were all right, but the man
   was all wrong. He was as clumsy a man when he was sitting still as when
   he was working, but it was your demands that made manifest the
   clumsiness that was all the time in his make-up, whether he was active
   or inactive.

   We are all sinners by nature. If God asks nothing of us, all seems to
   go well, but as soon as He demands something of us the occasion is
   provided for a grand display of our sinfulness. The Law makes our
   weakness manifest. While you let me sit still I appear to be all right,
   but when you ask me to do anything I am sure to spoil that thing, and
   if you trust me with a second thing I will as surely spoil it too. When
   a holy law is applied to a sinful man, then his sinfulness comes out in
   full display.

   God knows who I am; He knows that from head to foot I am full of sin;
   He knows that I am weakness incarnate; that I can do nothing. The
   trouble is that I do not know it. I admit that all men are sinners and
   that therefore I am a sinner; but I imagine that I am not such a
   hopeless sinner as some. God must bring us all to the place where we
   see that we are utterly weak and helpless. While we say so, we do not
   wholly believe it, and God has to do something to convince us of the
   fact. Had it not been for the Law we should never have known how weak
   we are. Paul had reached that point. He makes this clear when he says
   in Romans 7:7: "I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had
   not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet".
   Whatever might be his experience with the rest of the Law, it was the
   tenth commandment, which literally translated is: "Thou shalt not
   desire..." that found him out. There his total failure and incapacity
   stared him in the face!

   The more we try to keep the Law the more our weakness is manifest and
   the deeper we get into Romans 7, until it is clearly demonstrated to us
   that we are hopelessly weak. God knew it all along but we did not, and
   so God had to bring us through painful experiences to a recognition of
   the fact. We need to have our weakness proved to ourselves beyond
   dispute. That is why God gave us the Law.

   So we can say, reverently, that God never gave us the Law to keep; He
   gave us the Law to break! He well knew that we could not keep it. We
   are so bad that He asks no favour and makes no demands. Never has any
   man succeeded in making himself acceptable to God by means of the Law.
   Nowhere in the New Testament are men of faith told that they are to
   keep the Law; but it does say that the Law was given so that there
   should be transgression. "The law came in... that the trespass might
   abound" (Rom. 5:20). The Law was given to make us law-breakers! No
   doubt I am a sinner in Adam; "Howbeit, I had not know sin, except
   through the law: ...for apart from the law sin is dead... but when the
   commandment came, sin revived, and I died" (Rom. 7:7-9). The Law is
   that which exposes our true nature. Alas, we are so conceited, and
   think ourselves so strong, that God has to give us something to test us
   and prove how weak we are. At last we see it and confess: I am a sinner
   through and through, and I can of myself do nothing whatever to please
   God.'

   No, the Law was not given in the expectation that we would keep it. It
   was given in the full knowledge that we would break it; and when we
   have broken it so completely that we are convinced of our utter need,
   then the Law has served its purpose. It has been our schoolmaster to
   bring us to Christ, that He Himself may fulfill it in us (Gal. 3:24).
     __________________________________________________________________

Christ The End Of The Law

   In Romans 6 we saw how God delivered us from sin; in Romans 7 we see
   how He delivers us from the Law. In chapter 6 we were shown the way of
   deliverance from sin in the picture of a master and his slave; in
   chapter 7 we are shown the way of deliverance from the Law in the
   picture of two husbands and a wife. The relation between sin and the
   sinner is that of master to slave; the relation between the Law and the
   sinner is that of husband to wife.

   Notice first that in the picture in Romans 7:1-4 by which Paul
   illustrates our deliverance from the Law there is only one woman, while
   there are two husbands. The woman is in a very difficult position, for
   she can only be wife of one of the two, and unfortunately she is
   married to the less desirable one. Let us make no mistake, the man to
   whom she is married is a good man; but the trouble lies here, that the
   husband and wife are totally unsuited to one another. He is a most
   particular man, accurate to a degree; she on the other hand is
   decidedly easy-going. With him all is definite and precise; with her
   all is vague and haphazard. He wants everything just so, while she
   accepts things as they come. How could there be happiness in such a
   home?

   And then that husband is so exacting! He is always making demands on
   his wife. And yet one cannot find fault with him, for as a husband he
   has a right to expect something of her; and besides, all his demands
   are perfectly legitimate. There is nothing wrong with the man and
   nothing wrong with his demands; the trouble is that he has the wrong
   kind of wife to carry them out. The two cannot get on at all; theirs
   are utterly incompatible natures. Thus the poor woman is in great
   distress. She is fully aware that she often makes mistakes, but living
   with such a husband it seems as though everything she says and does is
   wrong! What hope is there for her? If only she were married to that
   other Man all would be well. He is no less exacting than her husband,
   but He also helps much. She would fain marry Him, but her husband is
   still alive. What can she do? She is "bound by law to the husband" and
   unless he dies she cannot legitimately marry that other Man.

   This picture is not drawn by me but by the apostle Paul. The first
   husband is the Law; the second husband is Christ; and you are the
   woman. The Law requires much, but offers no help in the carrying out of
   its requirements. The Lord Jesus requires just as much, yea more (Matt.
   5:21-48) but what He requires from us He Himself carries out in us. The
   Law makes demands and leaves us helpless to fulfill them; Christ makes
   demands, but He Himself fulfills in us the very demands He makes.
   Little wonder that the woman desires to be freed from the first husband
   that she may marry that other Man! But her only hope of release is
   through the death of her first husband, and he holds on to life most
   tenaciously. Indeed there is not the least prospect of his passing
   away. "Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in
   no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished (Matt.
   5:18).

   The Law is going to continue for all eternity. If the Law will never
   pass away, then how can I ever be united to Christ? How can I marry a
   second husband if my first husband simply refuses to die? There is one
   way out. If he will not die, I can die, and if I die the marriage
   relationship is dissolved. And that is exactly God's way of deliverance
   from the Law. The most important point to note in this section of
   Romans 7 is the transition from verse 3 to verse 4. Verses 1 to 3 show
   that the husband should die, but in verse 4 we see that in fact it is
   the woman who dies. The Law does not pass away. God's righteous demands
   remain for ever, and if I live I must meet those demands; but if I die
   the Law has lost its claim upon me. It cannot follow me beyond the
   grave.

   Exactly the same principle operates in our deliverance from the Law as
   in our deliverance from sin. When I have died my old master, Sin, still
   continues to live, but his power over his slave extends as far as the
   grave and no further. He could ask me to do a hundred and one things
   when I was alive, but when I am dead he calls on me in vain. I am for
   ever freed from his tyranny. So it is with regard to the Law. While the
   woman lives she is bound to her husband, but with her death the
   marriage bond is dissolved and she is "discharged from the law of her
   husband". The Law may still make demands, but for me its power to
   enforce them is ended.

   Now the vital question arises: How do I die?' And the preciousness of
   our Lord's work comes in just here: "Ye also were made dead to the law
   through the body of Christ" (Rom. 7:4). When Christ died His body was
   broken, and since God placed me in Him (1 Cor. 1:30), I have been
   broken too. When He was crucified, I was crucified with Him.

   An Old Testament illustration may help to make this clear. It was the
   veil of testimony that separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy
   Place, and upon it were embroidered cherubim (Exod. 26:31; 2 Chron.
   3:14) whose faces, by analogy from Ezekiel 1:10 and 10:14, included
   that of a man as representing the human head of the whole natural
   creation (Psalm 8:4-8). In Old Testament days God dwelt within the veil
   and man without. Man could look upon the veil, but not within it. That
   veil symbolized our Lord's flesh, His body (Heb. 10:20). So in the
   Gospels men could only look upon the outward form of our Lord; they
   could not, save by Divine revelation (Matt. 16:16, 17), see the God who
   dwelt within. But when the Lord Jesus died, the veil of the temple was
   rent from top to bottom (Matt. 27:51) as by the hand of God, so that
   man could gaze right into the Most Holy Place. Since the death of the
   Lord Jesus, God is no longer veiled but seeks to reveal Himself (1 Cor.
   2:7-10).

   But when the veil was rent asunder, what happened to the cherubim? God
   rent only the veil, it is true, but the cherubim were there in the veil
   and were one with it, for they were embroidered upon it. It was
   impossible to rend the veil and preserve them whole. When the veil was
   rent the cherubim were rent with it. And, in the sight of God, when the
   Lord Jesus died the whole living creation died too.

   "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the
   body of Christ." That woman's husband may be very well and strong, but
   if she dies he may make as many demands upon her as he likes; it will
   not affect her in the slightest. Death has set her free from all her
   husband's claims. We were in the Lord Jesus when He died, and that
   inclusive death of His has for ever freed us from the Law. But our Lord
   did not remain in the grave. On the third day He rose again; and since
   we are still in Him we are risen too. The body of the Lord Jesus speaks
   not only of His death but of His resurrection, for His resurrection was
   a bodily resurrection. Thus "through the body of Christ" we are not
   only "dead to the law' but alive unto God.

   God's purpose in uniting us to Christ was not merely negative; it was
   gloriously positive--"that ye should be joined to another" (Rom. 7:4).
   Death has dissolved the old marriage relationship, so that the woman,
   driven to despair by the constant demands of her former husband, who
   never lifted a little finger to help her carry them out, is now set
   free to marry the other Man, who with every demand He makes becomes in
   her the power for its fulfillment.

   And what is the issue of this new union? "That we might bring forth
   fruit unto God" (Rom. 7:4). By the body of Christ that foolish, sinful
   woman has died, but being united to Him in death she is united to Him
   in resurrection also, and in the power of resurrection life she brings
   forth fruit unto God. The risen life of the Lord in her empowers her
   for all the demands God's holiness makes upon her. The Law of God is
   not annulled; it is perfectly fulfilled, for the risen Lord now lives
   out His life in her, and His life is always well-pleasing to the
   Father.

   What happens when a woman marries? She no longer bears her own name but
   that of her husband; and she shares not his name only but his
   possessions too. So it is when we are joined to Christ. When we belong
   to Him, all that is His becomes ours, and with His infinite resources
   at our disposal we are well able to meet all His demands.

Our End Is God's Beginning

   Now that we have settled the doctrinal side of the question we must
   come down to practical issues, staying a little longer with the
   negative aspect and keeping the positive for our next chapter. What
   does it mean in everyday life to be delivered from the Law? At the risk
   of a little overstatement, I reply, "It means that from henceforth I am
   going to do nothing whatever for God: I am never again going to try to
   please Him." What a doctrine!' you exclaim. What awful heresy! You
   cannot possibly mean that!'

   But remember, if I try to please God in the flesh', then immediately I
   place myself under the Law. I broke the Law; the Law pronounced the
   death sentence; the sentence was executed, and now by death I--the
   carnal I' (Rom. 7:14)--have been set free from all its claims. There is
   still a Law of God, and now there is in fact a "new commandment" that
   is infinitely more exacting than the old, but, Praise God! its demands
   are being met, for it is Christ who now fulfills them; it is Christ who
   works in me what is well-pleasing to God. "I came... to fulfill {the
   law}" were His words (Matt. 5:17). Thus Paul, from the ground of
   resurrection, can say: "Work out your own salvation with fear and
   trembling; for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to work,
   for his good pleasure" (Phil. 2:12, 13).

   It is God that worketh in you. Deliverance from law does not mean that
   we are free from doing the will of God. It certainly does not mean that
   we are going to be lawless. Very much the reverse! What it does mean
   however is that we are free from doing that will as of ourselves. Being
   fully persuaded that we cannot do it, we cease trying to please God
   from the ground of the old man. Having at last reached the point of
   utter despair in ourselves so that we cease even to try, we put our
   trust in the Lord to manifest His resurrection life in us.

   Let me illustrate by what I have seen in my own country. In China some
   bearers can carry a load of salt weighing 120 kilos, some even 250
   kilos. Now along comes a man who can carry only 120 kilos, and here is
   a load of 250 kilos. He knows perfectly well he cannot carry it, and if
   he is wise he will say: I won't touch it!' But the temptation to try is
   ingrained in human nature, so although he cannot possibly carry it he
   still tries. As a youngster I used to amuse myself watching ten or
   twenty of these fellows come along and try, though every one of them
   knew he could not possibly manage it. In the end he must give up and
   make way for the man who could.

   The sooner we too give up trying the better, for if we monopolize the
   task, then there is no room for the Holy Spirit. But if we say: I'll
   not do it; I'll trust Thee to do it for me', then we shall find that a
   Power stronger than ourselves is carrying us through.

   In 1923 I met a famous Canadian evangelist. I had said in an address
   something along the above lines, and as we walked back to his home
   afterwards he remarked: The note of Romans 7 is seldom sounded
   nowadays; it is good to hear it again. The day I was delivered from the
   Law was a day of Heaven on earth. After being a Christian for years I
   was still trying my best to please God, but the more I tried the more I
   failed. I regarded God as the greatest Demander in the universe, but I
   found myself impotent to fulfill the least of His demands. Suddenly one
   day, as I read Romans 7, light dawned and I saw that I had not only
   been delivered from sin but from the Law as well. In my amazement I
   jumped up and said: "Lord, are you really making no demands on me? Then
   I need do nothing more for You!"

   God's requirements have not altered, but we are not the ones to meet
   them. Praise God, He is the Lawgiver on the Throne, and He is the
   Lawkeeper in my heart. He who gave the Law, Himself keeps it. He makes
   the demands, but He also meets them. My friend could well jump up and
   shout when he found he had nothing to do, and all who make a like
   discovery can do the same. As long as we are trying to do anything, He
   can do nothing. It is because of our trying that we fail and fail and
   fail. God wants to demonstrate to us that we can do nothing at all, and
   until that is fully recognized our disappointments and disillusionments
   will never cease.

   A brother who was trying to struggle into victory remarked to me, I do
   not know why I am so weak.' The trouble with you', I said, is that you
   are weak enough not to do the will of God, but you are not weak enough
   to keep out of things altogether. You are still not weak enough. When
   you are reduced to utter weakness and are persuaded that you can do
   nothing whatever, then God will do everything.' We all need to come to
   the point where we say: Lord, I am unable to do anything for Thee, but
   I trust Thee to do everything in me.'

   I was once staying in a place in China with some twenty other brothers.
   There was inadequate provision for bathing in the home where we stayed,
   so we went for a daily plunge in the river. On one occasion a brother
   had cramp in one leg, and I suddenly saw he was sinking fast, so I
   motioned to another brother, who was an expert swimmer, to hasten to
   his rescue. But to my astonishment he made no move. So I grew desperate
   and called out: Don't you see the man is drowning?' and the other
   brothers, about as agitated as I was, shouted vigorously too. But our
   good swimmer still did not move. Calm and collected, he remained just
   where he was, apparently postponing the unwelcome task. Meantime the
   voice of the poor drowning brother grew fainter and his efforts
   feebler. In my heart I said: I hate that man! Think of his letting a
   brother drown before his very eyes and not going to the rescue!'

   But when the man was actually sinking, with a few swift strokes the
   swimmer was at his side, and both were safely ashore. When I got an
   opportunity I aired my views. I have never seen any Christian who loved
   his life quite as much as you do', I said. Think of the distress you
   would have saved that brother if you had considered yourself a little
   less and him a little more.' But the swimmer knew his business better
   than I did. Had I gone earlier', he said, he would have clutched me so
   fast that both of us would have gone under. A drowning man cannot be
   saved until he is utterly exhausted and ceases to make the slightest
   effort to save himself.'

   Do you see it? When we give up the case, then God will take it up. He
   is waiting until we are at an end of our resources and can do nothing
   more for ourselves. God has condemned all that is of the old creation
   and consigned it to the Cross. The flesh profiteth nothing! If we try
   to do anything in the flesh we are virtually repudiating the Cross of
   Christ. God has declared us to be fit only for death. When we truly
   believe that, then we confirm God's verdict by giving up all our
   fleshly efforts to please Him. Our every effort to do His will is a
   denial of His declaration in the Cross of our utter worthlessness. Our
   continued efforts are a misunderstanding on the one hand of God's
   demands and on the other hand of the source of supply.

   We see the Law and we think that we must meet its demands, but we need
   to remember that, though the Law in itself is all right, it will be all
   wrong if it is applied to the wrong person. The "wretched man" of
   Romans 7 tried to meet the demands of God's law himself, and that was
   the cause of his trouble. The repeated use of the little word I' in
   this chapter gives the clue to the failure. "The good which I would I
   do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practice" (Rom. 7:19).
   There was a fundamental misconception in this man's mind. He thought
   God was asking him to keep the Law, so of course he was trying to keep
   it. But God was requiring no such thing of him. What was the result?
   Far from doing what pleased God, he found himself doing what displeased
   Him. In his very efforts to do the will of God he did exactly the
   opposite of what he knew to be His will.
     __________________________________________________________________

I Thank God!

   Romans 6 deals with "the body of sin", Romans 7 with "the body of this
   death" (6:6; 7:24). In chapter 6 the whole question before us is sin;
   in chapter 7 the whole question before us is death. What is the
   difference between the body of sin and the body of death? In regard to
   sin (that is, to whatever displeases God) I have a body of sin--a body,
   that is to say, which is actively engaged in sin. But in regard to the
   Law of God (that is, to that which expresses the will of God) I have a
   body of death. My activity in regard to sin makes my body a body of
   sin; my failure in regard to all that is wicked, worldly and Satanic I
   am, in my nature, wholly positive; but in regard to all that pertains
   to holiness and Heaven and God I am wholly negative.

   Have you discovered the truth of that in your life? It is no good
   merely to discover it in Romans 6 and 7. Have you discovered that you
   carry the encumbrance of a lifeless body in regard to God's will? You
   have no difficulty in speaking about wordly matters, but when you try
   to speak for the Lord you are tongue-tied; when you try to pray you
   feel sleepy; when you try to do something for the Lord you feel unwell.
   You can do anything but that which is related to God's will. There is
   something in this body that does not harmonize with the will of God.

   What does death mean? We may illustrate from a well-known verse in the
   first letter to the Corinthians: "For this cause many among you are
   weak and sickly, and not a few sleep" (1 Corinthians 11:30). Death is
   weakness produced to its extremity - weakness, sickness, death. Death
   means utter weakness; it means you are weak to such a point that you
   can become no weaker. That I have a body of death in relation to God's
   will means that I am so weak in regard to serving God, so utterly weak,
   that I am reduced to a point of dire helplessness. "O wretched man that
   I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?" cried Paul,
   and it is good when anyone cries out as he did. There is nothing more
   musical in the ears of the Lord. This cry is the most spiritual and the
   most scriptural cry a man can utter. He only utters it when he knows he
   can do nothing, and gives up making any further resolutions. Up to this
   point, every time he failed he made a new resolution and doubled and
   redoubled his will-power. At last he discovers there is no use in his
   making up his mind any more, and he cries out in desperation: "O
   wretched man that I am !" Like a man who suddenly awakes to find
   himself in a burning building, his cry is now for help, for he has come
   to the point where he despairs of himself.

   Have you despaired of yourself, or do you hope that if you read and
   pray more you will be a better Christian? Bible-reading and prayer are
   not wrong, and God forbid that we should suggest that they are, but it
   is wrong to trust even in them for victory. Our help is in Him who is
   the object of that reading and prayer. Our trust must be in Christ
   alone. Happily the "wretched man" does not merely deplore his
   wretchedness; he asks a fine question, namely: "Who shall deliver me?"
   "Who?" Hitherto he has looked for some thing; now his hope is in a
   Person. Hitherto he has looked within for a solution to his problem;
   now he looks beyond himself for a Savior. He no longer puts forth
   self-effort; all his expectation is now in Another.

   How did we obtain forgiveness of sins? Was it by reading, praying,
   almsgiving, and so on? No, we looked to the Cross, believing in what
   the Lord Jesus had done; and deliverance from sin becomes ours on
   exactly the same principle, nor is it otherwise with the question of
   pleasing God. In the matter of forgiveness we look to Him on the Cross;
   in the matter of deliverance from sin and of doing the will of God we
   look to Him in our hearts. For the one we depend on what He has done;
   for the other we depend on what He will do in us; but in regard to
   both, our dependence is on Him alone. He is the One who does it all.

   At the time when the Epistle to the Romans was written a murderer was
   punished in a peculiar and terrible manner. The dead body of the one
   murdered was tied to the living body of the murderer, head to head,
   hand to hand, foot to foot, and the living one was bound to the dead
   one till death. The murderer could go where he pleased, but wherever he
   went he had to carry the corpse of that murdered man with him. Could
   punishment be more appalling? Yet this is the illustration Paul now
   uses. It is as though he were bound to a dead body and unable to get
   free. Wherever he goes he is hampered by this terrible burden. At last
   he can bear it no longer and cries: "O wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me...?" And then, in a flash of illumination, his cry of
   despair changes to a song of praise. He has found the answer to his
   question. "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. 7:25).

   We know that justification is ours through the Lord Jesus and requires
   no work on our part, but we think sanctification is dependent on our
   own efforts. We know we can receive forgiveness only by entire reliance
   on the Lord; yet we believe we can obtain deliverance by doing
   something ourselves. We fear that if we do nothing, nothing will
   happen. After salvation the old habit of doing' reasserts itself and we
   begin our old self-efforts again. Then God's word comes afresh to us:
   "It is finished" (John 19:30). He has done everything on the Cross for
   our forgiveness and He will do everything in us for our deliverance. In
   both cases He is the doer. "It is God that worketh in you."

   The first words of the delivered man are very precious--"I thank God".
   If someone gives you a cup of water you thank the person who gave it,
   not someone else. Why did Paul say "Thank God"? Because God was the One
   who did everything. Had it been Paul who did it, he would have said,
   "Thank Paul". But he saw that Paul was a "wretched man" and that God
   alone could meet his need; so he said, "Thank God". God wants to do
   all, for He must have all the glory. If we do some of the work, then we
   will get some of the glory; but God must have it all Himself, so He
   does all the work from beginning to end.

   What we have said in this chapter might seem negative and unpractical
   if we were to stop at this point, as though the Christian life were a
   matter of sitting still and waiting for something to happen. Of course
   it is very far from being so. All who truly live it know it to be a
   matter of very positive and active faith in Christ and in an altogether
   new principle of life--the law of the Spirit of life. We are now going
   to look at the effects in us of this new life principle.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 10: The Path of Progress: Walking In The Spirit

   Coming now to Romans 8 we may first summarize the argument of our
   second section of the letter from chapter 5:12 to chapter 8:39 in two
   phrases, each containing a contrast and each marking an aspect of
   Christian experience. The are: Romans 5:12 to 6:23: In Adam' and in
   Christ'. Romans 7:1 to 8:39: In the flesh' and in the Spirit'.

   We need to understand the relationship of these four things. The former
   two are objective' and set forth our position, firstly as we were by
   nature and secondly as we now are by faith in the redemptive work of
   Christ. The latter two are subjective' and relate to our walk as a
   matter of practical experience. Scripture makes it clear that the first
   two give us only a part of the picture and that the second two are
   required to complete it. We think it enough to be "in Christ", but we
   learn now that we must also walk "in the Spirit" (Rom. 8:9). The
   frequent occurrence of "the Spirit" in the early part of Romans 8
   serves to emphasize this further important lesson of the Christian
   life.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Flesh And The Spirit

   The flesh is linked with Adam; the Spirit with Christ. Leaving aside
   now as settled the question of whether we are in Adam or in Christ, we
   must ask ourselves: Am I living in the flesh or in the Spirit?

   To live in the flesh is to do something out from' [13] myself as in
   Adam. It is to derive strength from the old natural source of life that
   I inherited from him, so that I enjoy in experience all Adam's very
   complete provision for sinning which all of us have found so effective.
   Now the same is true of what is in Christ. To enjoy in experience what
   is true of me as in Him, I must learn what it is to walk in the Spirit.
   It is a historic fact that in Christ my old man was crucified, and it
   is a present fact that I am blessed "with every spiritual blessing in
   the heavenly places in Christ" (Eph. 1:3); but if I do not live in the
   Spirit, then my life may be quite a contradiction of the fact that I am
   in Christ, for what is true of me in Him is not expressed in me. I may
   recognize that I am in Christ, but I may also have to face the fact
   that my old temper is very much in evidence.

   What is the trouble? It is that I am holding the truth merely
   objectively, whereas what is true objectively must be made true
   subjectively; and that is brought about as I live in the Spirit.

   Not only am I in Christ, but Christ is in me. And just as physically a
   man cannot live and work in water but only in air, so spiritually
   Christ dwells and manifests Himself not in flesh' but in spirit'.
   Therefore if I live "after the flesh" I find that what is mine in
   Christ is, so to say, held in suspense in me. Though in fact I am in
   Christ, yet if I live in the flesh--that is, in my own strength and
   under my own direction--then in experience I find to my dismay that it
   is what is in Adam that manifests itself in me. If I would know in
   experience all that is in Christ, then I must learn to live in the
   Spirit.

   Living in the Spirit means that I trust the Holy Spirit to do in me
   what I cannot do myself. This life is completely different from the
   life I would naturally live of myself. Each time I am faced with a new
   demand from the Lord, I look to Him to do in me what He requires of me.
   It is not a case of trying but of trusting; not of struggling but of
   resting in Him. If I have a hasty temper, impure thoughts, a quick
   tongue or a critical spirit, I shall not set out with a determined
   effort to change myself, but, reckoning myself dead in Christ to these
   things, I shall look to the Spirit of God to produce in me the needed
   purity or humility or meekness. This is what it means to "stand still,
   and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you" (Exod.
   14:13).

   Some of you have no doubt had an experience something like the
   following. You have been asked to go and see a friend, and you knew the
   friend was not very friendly, but you trusted the Lord to see you
   through. You told Him before you set out that in yourself you could not
   but fail, and you asked Him for all that was needed. Then, to your
   surprise, you did not feel at all irritated, though your friend was far
   from gracious. On your return you thought over the experience and
   marveled that you kept so calm, and you wondered if you would be just
   as calm next time. You were amazed at yourself and sought an
   explanation. This is the explanation: the Holy Spirit carried you
   through.

   Unfortunately we only have this kind of experience once in while, but
   it should be a constant experience. When the Holy Spirit takes things
   in hand there is no need for strain on our part. It is not a case of
   clenching our teeth and thinking that thus we have controlled ourselves
   beautifully and have had a glorious victory. No, where there is a real
   victory there is no fleshly effort. We are gloriously carried through
   by the Lord.

   The object of temptation is always to get us to do something. During
   the first three months of the Japanese war in China we lost a great
   many tanks and so were unable to deal with the Japanese tanks, until
   the following scheme was devised. A single shot would be fired at a
   Japanese tank by one of our snipers in ambush. After a considerable
   lapse of time the first shot would be followed by a second; then, after
   a further silence, by another shot; until the tank driver, eager to
   locate the source of the disturbance, would pop his head out to look
   around. The next shot, carefully aimed, would put an end to him.

   As long as he remained under cover he was perfectly safe. The whole
   scheme was devised to bring him out into the open. In the same way,
   Satan's temptations are not primarily to make us do something
   particularly sinful, but merely to cause us to act in our own energy;
   and as soon as we step out of our hiding-place to do something on that
   basis, he has gained the victory over us. If we do not move, if we do
   not come out of the cover of Christ into the realm of the flesh, then
   he cannot get us.

   The Divine way of victory does not permit of our doing anything at
   all--anything, that is to say, outside of Christ. This is because as
   soon as we move we run into danger, for our natural inclinations take
   us in the wrong direction. Where, then, are we to look for help? Turn
   now to Galatians 5:17: "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the
   Spirit against the flesh". In other words, the flesh does not fight
   against us but against the Holy Spirit, "for these are contrary the one
   to the other", and it is He, not we, who meets and deals with the
   flesh. What is the result? "That ye may not do the things that ye
   would."

   I think we have often understood that last clause of this verse in a
   wrong sense. Let us consider what it means. What would we do'
   naturally? We would move off on some course of action dictated by our
   own instincts and apart from the will of God. The effect then of our
   refusal to act out from ourselves is that the Holy Spirit is free to
   meet and deal with the flesh in us, with the result that we shall not
   do what we naturally would do; that is, we shall not act according to
   our natural inclinations; we shall not go off on a course and plan of
   our own: but shall find instead our satisfaction in His perfect plan.
   Hence we have the principle: "Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not
   fulfill the lust of the flesh" (Gal. 5:16). If we live in the Spirit,
   if we walk by faith in the risen Christ, we can truly stand aside'
   while the Spirit gains new victories over the flesh every day. He has
   been given to us to take charge of this business. Our victory lies in
   hiding in Christ, and in counting in simple trust upon His Holy Spirit
   to overcome in us our fleshly lusts with His own new desires. The Cross
   has been given to procure salvation for us; the Spirit has been given
   to produce salvation in us. Christ risen and ascended is the basis of
   our salvation; Christ in our hearts by the Spirit is its power.

Christ Our Life

   "I thank God through Jesus Christ"! That exclamation of Paul's is
   fundamentally the same as his other words in Galatians 2:20 which we
   have taken as the key to our study: "I live; and yet no longer I, but
   Christ". We saw how prominent is the word I' throughout his argument in
   Romans 7, culminating in the agonized cry: "O wretched man that I am!"
   Then follows the shout of deliverance: "Thank God... Jesus Christ"! and
   it is clear that the discovery Paul has made is this, that the life we
   live is the life of Christ alone. We think of the Christian life as a
   changed life', a substituted life', and Christ is our Substitute
   within. "I live; and yet no longer I, but Christ liveth in me." This
   life is not something which we ourselves have to produce. It is
   Christ's own life reproduced in us.

   How many Christians believe in reproduction' in this sense, as
   something more than regeneration? Regeneration means that the life of
   Christ is planted in us by the Holy Spirit at our new birth.
   Reproduction' goes further: it means that new life grows and becomes
   manifest progressively in us, until the very likeness of Christ begins
   to be reproduced in our lives. That is what Paul means when he speaks
   of his travail for the Galatians "until Christ be formed in you" (Gal.
   4:19).

   Let me illustrate with another story. I once arrived in America in the
   home of a saved couple who requested me to pray for them. I inquired
   the case of their trouble. Oh, Mr. Nee, we have been in a bad way
   lately', they confessed. We are so easily irritated by the children,
   and during the past few weeks we have both lost our tempers several
   times a day. We are really dishonoring the Lord. Will you ask Him to
   give us patience?' That is the one thing I cannot do', I said. What do
   you mean?' they asked. I mean that one thing is certain', I answered,
   and that is that God is not going to answer your prayer.' At that they
   said in amazement, Do you mean to tell us we have gone so far that God
   is not willing to hear us when we ask Him to make us patient?' No, I do
   not mean quite that, but I would like to ask you if you have ever
   prayed in this respect. You have. But did God answer? No! Do you know
   why? Because you have no need of patience.' Then the eyes of the wife
   blazed up. She said, What do you mean? We do not need patience, and yet
   we get irritated the whole day long! What do you mean?' It is not
   patience you have need of', I answered, it is Christ.'

   God will not give me humility or patience or holiness or love as
   separate gifts of His grace. He is not a retailer dispensing grace to
   us in doses, measuring out some patience to the impatient, some love to
   the unloving, some meekness to the proud, in quantities that we take
   and work on as kind of capital. He has given only one gift to meet all
   our need--His Son Christ Jesus, and as I look to Him to live out His
   life in me, He will be humble and patient and loving and everything
   else I need--in my stead. Remember the word in the first Epistle of
   John: "God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He
   that hath the Son hath the life; and he that hath not the Son of God
   hath not the life" (1 John 5:11, 12). The life of God is not given us
   as a separate item; the life of God is given us in the Son. It is
   "eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom. 6:23). Our relationship
   to the Son is our relationship to the life.

   It is a blessed thing to discover the difference between Christian
   graces and Christ: to know the difference between meekness and Christ,
   between patience and Christ, between love and Christ. Remember again
   what is said in 1 Corinthians 1:30: "Christ Jesus... was made unto us
   wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption."
   The common conception of sanctification is that every item of the life
   should be holy; but that is not holiness, it is the fruit of holiness.
   Holiness is Christ. It is the Lord Jesus being made over to us to be
   that. So you can put in anything there: love, humility, power,
   self-control. Today there is a call for patience: He is our patience!
   Tomorrow the call may be for purity: He is our purity! He is the answer
   to every need. That is why Paul speaks of "the fruit of the Spirit" as
   one (Gal. 5:22) and not of fruits' as separate items. God has given us
   His Holy Spirit, and when love is needed the fruit of the Spirit is
   love; when joy is needed the fruit of the Spirit is joy. It is always
   true. It does not matter what your personal deficiency, or whether it
   is a hundred and one different things, God has one sufficient
   answer--His Son Jesus Christ, and He is the answer to every human need.

   How can we know more of Christ in this way? Only by way of an
   increasing awareness of need. Some are afraid to discover deficiency in
   themselves and so they never grow. Growth in grace is the only sense in
   which we can grow, and grace, we have said, is God doing something for
   us. We all have the same Christ dwelling within, but revelation of some
   new need will lead us spontaneously to trust Him to live out His life
   in us in that particular. Greater capacity means greater enjoyment of
   God's supply. Another letting go, a fresh trusting in Christ, and
   another stretch of land is conquered. Christ my life' is the secret of
   enlargement.

   We have spoken of trying and trusting, and the difference between the
   two. Believe me, it is the difference between Heaven and hell. It is
   not something just to be talked over as a good thought; it is stark
   reality. Lord, I cannot do it, therefore I will no longer try to do
   it.' This is the point where most of us fail. Lord, I cannot; therefore
   I will take my hands off; from now on I trust Thee for that.' I refuse
   to act; I depend on Him to act and then I enter fully and joyfully into
   the action He initiates. It is not passivity; it is a most active life,
   trusting the Lord like that; drawing life from Him, taking Him to be my
   very life, letting Him out His life in me.

The Law Of This Spirit Of Life

   "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ
   Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law
   of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made free from the law of
   sin and death" (Rom. 8:1, 2, A.V.).

   It is in chapter 8 that Paul presents to us in detail the positive side
   of life in the Spirit. "There is therefore now no condemnation", he
   begins, and this statement may at first seem out of place here. Surely
   condemnation was met by the Blood through which we found peace with God
   and salvation from wrath (Rom. 5:1, 9). But there are two kinds of
   condemnation, namely, that before God and that before myself (just as
   earlier we saw there are two kinds of peace) and the second may at
   times seem to us even more awful than the first. When I see that the
   Blood of Christ has satisfied God, then I know my sins are forgiven,
   and there is for me no more condemnation before God. Yet I may still be
   knowing defeat, and the sense of inward condemnation on this account
   may be very real, as Romans 7 shows. But if I have learned to live by
   Christ as my life, then I have learned the secret of victory, and,
   praise God! "there is therefore now no condemnation". "The mind of the
   spirit is life and peace" (Rom. 8:6), and this becomes my experience as
   I learn to walk in the Spirit. With peace in my heart I have no time to
   feel condemned, but only to praise Him who leads me on from victory to
   victory.

   But what lay behind my sense of condemnation? Was it not the experience
   of defeat and the sense of helplessness to do anything about it? Before
   I saw that Christ is my life, I labored under a constant sense of
   handicap; limitation dogged my steps; I felt disabled at every turn. I
   was always crying out: I cannot do this! I cannot do that!' Try as I
   would, I found that I "cannot please God" (Rom. 8:8). But there is no I
   cannot' in Christ. Now it is: "I can do all things in him that
   strengtheneth me" (Phil. 4:13).

   How can Paul be so daring? On what ground does he declare that he is
   now free from limitation and "can do all things"? Here is his answer:
   "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from
   the law of sin and of death" (Rom. 8:2). Why is there no more
   condemnation? "For ...": there is a reason for it; there is something
   definite to account for it. The reason is that there is a law called
   "the law of the Spirit of life" and it has proved stronger than another
   law called the law of sin and death". What are these laws? How do they
   operate? And what is the difference between sin and the law of sin, and
   between death and the law of death?

   First let us ask ourselves, What is a law? Well, strictly speaking, a
   law is a generalization examined until it is proved that there is no
   exception. We might define it more simply as something which happens
   over and over again. Each time the thing happens it happens in the same
   way. We can illustrate this both from statutory and from natural law.
   For example, in this land, if I drive a car on the right hand side of
   the road the traffic police will stop me. Why? Because it is against
   the law of the land. If you do it you will be stopped too. Why? For the
   same reason that I would be stopped: it is against the law and the law
   makes no exceptions. It is something which happens repeatedly and
   unfailingly. Or again, we all know what is meant by gravity. If I drop
   my handkerchief in London it falls to the ground. That is the effect of
   gravity. But the same is true if I drop it in New York or Hong Kong. No
   matter where I let it go, gravity operates, and it always produces the
   same results. Whenever the same conditions prevail the same effects are
   seen. There is thus a law' of gravity.

   Now what of the law of sin and death? If someone passes an unkind
   remark about me, at once something goes wrong inside me. That is not
   law; that is sin. But if, when different people pass unkind remarks,
   the same something' goes wrong inside, then I discern a law within--a
   law of sin. Like the law of gravity, it is something constant. It
   always works the same way. And so too with the law of death. Death, we
   have said, is weakness produced to its limit. Weakness is I cannot'.
   Now if when I try to please God in this particular matter I find I
   cannot, and if when I try to please Him in that other thing I again
   find I cannot, then I discern a law at work. There is not only sin in
   me but a law of sin; there is not only death in me but a law of death.

   Then again, not only is gravity a law in the sense that it is constant,
   admitting of no exception, but, unlike the rule of the road, it is a
   natural' law and not the subject of discussion and decision but of
   discovery. The law is there, and the handkerchief naturally' drops by
   itself without any help from me. And the "law" discovered by the man in
   Romans 7:23 is just like that. It is a law of sin and of death, opposed
   to that which is good, and crippling the man's will to do good. He
   naturally' sins according to the "law of sin" in his members. He wills
   to be different, but that law in him is relentless and no human will
   can resist it. So this brings me to the question, How can I be set free
   from the law of sin an death? I need deliverance from sin, and still
   more do I need deliverance from death, but most of all I need
   deliverance from the law of sin and of death. How can I be delivered
   from the constant repetition of weakness and failure? In order to
   answer this question let us follow out our two illustrations further.

   One of our great burdens in China used to be the likin tax, a law which
   none could escape, originating in the Ch'in Dynasty and operating right
   down to our own day. It was an inland tax on the transit of goods,
   applied throughout the empire and having numerous barriers for
   collection, and officers enjoying very large powers. The result was
   that the charge on goods passing through several provinces might become
   very heavy indeed. But a few years ago a second law came into operation
   which set aside the likin law. Can you imagine the feelings of relief
   in those who had suffered under the old law? Now there was no need to
   think or hope or pray; the new law was already there and had delivered
   us from the old law. No longer was there need to think beforehand what
   one would say if one met a likin officer tomorrow!

   And as with the law of the land, so it is with natural law. How can the
   law of gravity be annulled? With regard to my handkerchief that law is
   at work clearly enough, pulling it down, but I have only to place my
   hand under the handkerchief and it does not drop. Why? The law is still
   there. I do not deal with the law of gravity; in fact I cannot deal
   with the law of gravity. Then why does my handkerchief not fall to the
   ground? Because there is a power keeping it from doing so. The law is
   there, but another law superior to it is in operation to overcome it,
   namely the law of life. Gravity can do its utmost but the handkerchief
   will not drop, because another law is working against the law of
   gravity to maintain it there. We have all seen the tree which was once
   a small seed fallen between the slabs of a paving, and which has grown
   until heavy stone blocks have been lifted by the power of the life
   within it. That is what we mean by the triumph of one law over another.

   In just such a manner God delivers us from one law by introducing
   another law. The law of sin and death is there all the time, but God
   has put another law into operation - the law of the Spirit of life in
   Christ Jesus, and that law is strong enough to deliver us from the law
   of sin and death. You see, it is a law of life in Christ Jesus--the
   resurrection life that in Him has met death in all its forms and
   triumphed over it (Eph. 1:19, 20). The Lord Jesus dwells in our hearts
   in the person of His Holy Spirit, and if we let Him have a clear way
   and commit ourselves to Him we shall find that He will keep us from the
   old law. We shall learn what it is to be kept, not by our own power,
   but "by the power of God" (1 Peter 1:5).
     __________________________________________________________________

The Manifestation Of The Law Of Life

   Let us seek to make this practical. We touched earlier on the matter of
   our will in relation to the things of God. Even older Christians do not
   realize how great a part will-power plays in their lives. That was part
   of Paul's trouble in Romans 7. His will was good, but all his actions
   contradicted it, and however much he made up his mind and set himself
   to please God, it led him only into worse darkness. I would do good',
   but "I am carnal, sold under sin". That is the point. Like a car
   without petrol, that has to be pushed and that stops as soon as it is
   left alone, many Christians endeavour to drive themselves by
   will-power, and then think the Christian life a most exhausting and
   bitter one. Some even force themselves to say Hallelujah!' because
   others do it, while admitting there is no meaning in it to them. They
   force themselves to be what they are not, and it is worse than trying
   to make water run up-hill. For after all, the very highest point the
   will can reach is that of willingness (Matt. 26:41).

   If we have to exert so much effort in our Christian living, it simply
   says that we are not really like that at all. We don't need to force
   ourselves to speak our native language. In fact we only have to exert
   will-power in order to do things we do not do naturally. We may do them
   for a time, but the law of sin and death wins in the end. We may be
   able to say: To will is present with me, and I perform that which is
   good for two weeks', but eventually we shall have to confess: How to
   perform it I know not'. No, what I already am I do not long to be. If I
   "would" it is because I am not.

   You ask, Why do men use will-power to try to please God? There may be
   two reasons. They may of course never have experienced the new birth,
   in which case they have no new life to draw upon; or they may have been
   born again and the life be there, but they have not learned to trust in
   that life. It is this lack of understanding that results in habitual
   failure and sinning, bringing them to the place where they almost cease
   to believe in the possibility of anything better.

   But because we have not believed fully, that does not mean that the
   feeble life we intermittently experience is all God has given us.
   Romans 6:23 states that "the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ
   Jesus our Lord", and now in Romans 8:2 we read that "the law of the
   Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" has come to our aid. So Romans 8:2
   speaks not of a new gift but of the life already referred to in Romans
   6:23. In other words, it is a new revelation of what we already have. I
   feel I cannot emphasize this too much. It is not something fresh from
   God's hand, but a new unveiling of what He has already given. It is a
   new discovery of a work already done in Christ, for the words "made me
   free" are in the past tense. If I really see this and put my faith in
   Him, there is no absolute necessity for Romans 7 to be repeated in
   me--either the experience or the conduct, and certainly not the
   tremendous display of will-power.

   If we will let go our own wills and trust Him, we shall not fall to the
   ground and break, but we shall fall into a different law, the law of
   the Spirit of life. For He has given us not only life but a law of
   life. And just as the law of gravity is a natural law and not the
   result of human legislation, so the law of life is a natural' law,
   similar in principle to the law that keeps our heart beating or that
   controls the movement of our eyelids. There is no need for us to think
   about our eyes, or to decide that we must blink every so often to keep
   them cleansed; and still less do we bring our will to bear upon our
   heart. Indeed to do so might rather harm than help it. No, so long as
   it has life it works spontaneously. Our wills only interfere with the
   law of life. I discovered that fact once in the following way.

   I used to suffer from sleeplessness. Once after several sleepless
   nights, when I had prayed much about it and exhausted all my resources,
   I confessed at length to God that the fault must lie with me and asked
   to be shown where. I said to God: I demand an explanation'. He answer
   was: Believe in nature's laws'. Sleep is as much a law as hunger is,
   and I realized that though I had never thought of worrying whether I
   would get hungry or not, I had been worrying about sleeping. I had been
   trying to help nature, and that is the chief trouble with most
   sufferers from sleeplessness. But now I trusted not only God but God's
   law of nature, and slept well.

   Should we not read the Bible? Of course we should or our spiritual life
   will suffer. But that should not mean forcing ourselves to read. There
   is a new law in us which gives us a hunger for it. Then half an hour
   can be more profitable than five hours of forced reading. And it is the
   same with giving, with preaching, with testimony. Forced preaching is
   apt to result in preaching a warm gospel with a cold heart, and we all
   know what men mean by cold charity'.

   If we will let ourselves live in the new law we shall be less conscious
   of the old law. It is still there, but it is no longer governing and we
   are no longer in its grip. That is why the Lord says in Matthew 6:
   "Behold the birds... Consider the lilies". If we could ask the birds
   whether they were not afraid of the law of gravity, how would they
   reply? They would say: We never heard the name of Newton. We know
   nothing about his law. We fly because it is the law of our life to
   fly.' Not only is there in them a life with the power of flight, but
   that life has a law which enables these living creatures quite
   spontaneously and consistently to overcome the law of gravity. Yet
   gravity remains. If you get up early one morning when the cold is
   intense and the snow thick on the ground, and there is a dead sparrow
   in the courtyard, you are reminded at once of the persistence of that
   law. But while birds live they overcome it, and the life within them is
   what dominates their consciousness.

   God has been truly gracious to us. He has given us this new law of the
   Spirit, and for us to fly' is no longer a question of our will but of
   His life. Have you noticed what a trial it is to make an impatient
   Christian patient? To require patience of him is enough to make him ill
   with depression. But God has never told us to force ourselves to be
   what we are not naturally: to try by taking thought to add to our
   spiritual stature. Worrying may possibly decrease a man's height, but
   it certainly never added anything to it. "Be not anxious", are His
   words. "Consider the lilies, ... they grow." He is directing our
   attention to the new law of life in us. Oh, for a new appreciation of
   the life that is ours!

   What a precious discovery this is! It can make altogether new men of
   us, for it operates in the smallest things as well as in the bigger
   ones. It checks us when, for example, we put out a hand to look at a
   book in someone else's room, reminding us that we have not asked
   permission and have no right to do so. We cannot, the Holy Spirit tells
   us, encroach thus upon the rights of others.

   Once I was talking to a Christian friend and he turned to me and said:
   Do you know, I believe that if anyone is willing to live by the law of
   the Spirit of life, such a man will become truly refined.' What do you
   mean?' I asked. He replied: That law has the power to make a man a
   perfect gentleman. Some scornfully say: "you can't blame those people
   for the way they act; they are just country folk and have no
   educational advantages". But the real question is, Have they the life
   of the Lord within? For I tell you, that life can say to them: "Your
   voice is too loud", or, "That laughter was not right", or, "Your motive
   in passing that remark was wrong." In a thousand details the Spirit of
   life can tell them how to act, so producing in them a true refinement.
   There is no such inherent power in education.' And yet my friend was
   himself an educationalist!

   But it is true. Take the example of talkativeness. Are you a person of
   too many words? When you stay with people, do you say to yourself: What
   shall I do? I am a Christian; but if I am to glorify the name of the
   Lord, I simple must not talk so much. So today let me be extra careful
   to hold myself in check.'? And for an hour or two you succeed--until on
   some pretext you loose control and, before you know where you are, find
   yourself once again in difficulty with your garrulous tongue. Yes, let
   us be fully assured that the will is useless here. For me to exhort you
   to exercise your will in this matter would be but to offer you the vain
   religion of the world, not the life in Christ Jesus. For consider
   again: a talkative person remains just that, though he keep silent all
   day, for there is a natural' law of talkativeness governing him (or
   her!), just as a peach tree is a peach tree whether or not it bears
   peaches. But as Christians we discover a new law in us, the law of the
   spirit of life, which transcends all else and which has already
   delivered us from the law' of our talkativeness. If, believing the
   Lord's Word, we yield ourselves to that new law, it will tell us when
   we should stop talking--or not start!--and it will empower us to do so.
   On that basis you can go to your friend's house for two or three hours,
   or stay for two or three days, and experience no difficulty. On your
   return you will just thank God for His new law of life.

   It is this spontaneous life that is the Christian life. It manifests
   itself in love for the unlovely--for the brother whom on natural
   grounds we would not like and certainly could not love. It works on the
   basis of what the Lord sees of possibility in that brother. Lord, You
   see he is lovable and You love him. Love him, now, through me!' And it
   manifests itself in reality of life--in a true genuineness of moral
   character. There is too much hypocrisy in the lives of Christians, too
   much play-acting. Nothing takes away from the effectiveness of
   Christian witness as does a pretense of something that is not really
   there, for the man in the street unfailingly penetrates such a disguise
   in the end and finds us out for what we are. Yes, pretense gives way to
   reality when we trust the law of life.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Fourth Step: "Walk... After The Spirit"

   "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
   God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an
   offering for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the ordinance of the
   law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after
   the Spirit" (Rom. 8:3).

   Every careful reader of these two verses will see that there are two
   things presented here. They are, firstly, what the Lord Jesus has done
   for us, and secondly, what the Holy Spirit will do in us. "The flesh"
   is "weak"; consequently the ordinance of the law cannot be fulfilled in
   us "after the flesh". (Remember, it is again here a question not of
   salvation but of pleasing God.) Now, because of our inability God took
   two steps. In the first place, He intervened to deal with the heart of
   our problem. He sent His Son in the flesh, who died for sin and in
   doing so "condemned sin in the flesh". That is to say, He took to death
   representatively all that belonged to the old creation in us, whether
   we speak of it as our old man', the flesh', or the carnal I'. Thus God
   struck at the very root of our trouble by removing the fundamental
   ground of our weakness. This was the first step.

   But still "the ordinance of the law" remained to be fulfilled "in us".
   How could this be done? It required God's further provision of the
   indwelling Holy Spirit. It is He who is sent to take care of the inward
   side of this thing, and He is able to do so, we are told, as we
   "walk... after the Spirit".

   What does it mean to walk after the Spirit? It means two things.
   Firstly, it is not a work; it is a walk. Praise God, the burdensome and
   fruitless effort I involved myself in when I sought in the flesh' to
   please God gives place to a blessed and restful dependence on "his
   working, which worketh in me mightily" (Col. 1:29). That is why Paul
   contrasts the "works" of the flesh with the "fruit" of the Spirit (Gal.
   5:19, 22).

   Then secondly, to "walk after" implies subjection. Walking after the
   flesh means that I yield to the dictates of the flesh, and the
   following verses in Romans 8:5-8 make clear where that leads me. It
   only brings me into conflict with God. To walk after the Spirit is to
   be subject to the Spirit. There is one thing that the man who walks
   after the Spirit cannot do, and that is be independent of Him. I must
   be subject to the Holy Spirit. The initiative of my life must be with
   Him. Only as I yield myself to obey Him shall I find the "law of the
   Spirit of life" in full operation and the "ordinance of the law" (all
   that I have been trying to do to please God) being fulfilled--no longer
   by me but in me. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are
   sons of God" (Rom. 8:14).

   We are all familiar with the words of the benediction in 2 Corinthians
   13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
   the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all". The love of God is
   the source of all spiritual blessing; the grace of the Lord Jesus has
   made it possible for that spiritual wealth to become ours; and the
   communion of the Holy Ghost is the means whereby it is imparted to us.
   Love is something hidden in the heart of God; grace is that love
   expressed and made available in the Son; communion is the importation
   of that grace by the Spirit. What the Father has devised concerning us
   the Son has accomplished for us, and now the Holy Spirit communicates
   it to us. When therefore we discover something fresh that the Lord
   Jesus has procured for us in His Cross, let us, for its realization,
   look in the direction that God has indicated, and, by our steadfast
   attitude of subjection and obedience to the Holy Spirit, keep wide open
   the way for Him to impart it to us. That is His ministry. He has come
   for that very purpose--that He may make real in us all that is ours in
   Christ.

   We have learned in China that, when leading a soul to Christ, we must
   be very thorough, for there is no certainty when he will again have the
   help of other Christians. We always seek to make it clear to a new
   believer that, when he has asked the Lord to forgive his sins and to
   come into his life, his heart has become the residence of a living
   Person. The Holy Spirit of God is now within him, to open to him the
   Scriptures that he may find Christ there, to direct his prayer, to
   govern his life, and to reproduce in him the character of his Lord.

   I went, late one summer, for a prolonged period of rest to a
   hill-resort where accommodation was difficult to obtain, and while
   there it was necessary for me to sleep in one house and take my meals
   in another, the latter being the home of a mechanic and his wife. For
   the first two weeks of my visit, apart from asking a blessing at each
   meal, I said nothing to my hosts about the Gospel; and then one day my
   opportunity came to tell them about the Lord Jesus. They were ready to
   listen and to come to Him in simple faith for the forgiveness of their
   sins. They were born again, and a new light and joy came into their
   lives, for theirs was a real conversion. I took care to make clear to
   them what had happened, and then, as the weather turned colder, the
   time came for me to leave them and return to Shanghai.

   During the cold winter months the man was in the habit of drinking wine
   with his meals, and he was apt to do so to excess. After my departure,
   with the return of the cold weather, the wine appeared on the table
   again, and that day, as he had become accustomed to do, the husband
   bowed his head to return thanks for the meal--but no words would come.
   After one or two vain attempts he turned to his wife. What is wrong?'
   he asked. Why cannot we pray today? Fetch the Bible and see what it has
   to say about wine drinking.' I had left a copy of the Scriptures with
   them, but though the wife could read she was ignorant of the Word, and
   she turned the pages in vain seeking for light on the subject. They did
   not know how to consult God's Book and it was impossible to consult
   God's messenger, for I was many miles away and it might be months
   before they could see me. Just drink your wine', said his wife. We'll
   refer the matter to brother Nee at the first opportunity.' But still
   the man found he just could not return thanks to the Lord for that
   wine. Take it away!' he said at length; and when she had done so,
   together they asked a blessing on their meal.

   When eventually the man was able to visit Shanghai he told me the
   story. Using an expression familiar in Chinese: Brother Nee', he said,
   Resident Boss [14] wouldn't let me have that drink!' Very good,
   brother', I said. You always listen to Resident Boss!'

   Many of us know that Christ is our life. We believe that the Spirit of
   God is resident in us, but this fact has little effect upon our
   behaviour. The question is, do we know Him as a living Person, and do
   we know Him as Boss'?

Chapter 11: One Body in Christ

   Before we pass on to our last important subject we will review some of
   the ground we have covered and summarize the steps taken. We have
   sought to make things simple, and to explain clearly some of the
   experiences which Christians commonly pass through. But it is clear
   that the new discoveries that we make as we walk with the Lord are
   many, and we must be careful to avoid the temptation to over-simplify
   the work of God. To do so may lead us into serious confusion.

   There are children of God who believe that all our salvation, in which
   they would include the matter of leading a holy life, lies in an
   appreciation of the value of the precious Blood. They rightly emphasize
   the importance of keeping short accounts with God over known specific
   sins, and the continual efficacy of the Blood to deal with sins
   committed, but they think of the Blood as doing everything. They
   believe in a holiness which in fact means only separation of the man
   from his past; that, through the up-to-date blotting out of what he has
   done on the ground of the shed Blood, God separates a man out of the
   world to be His, and that is holiness; and they stop there. Thus they
   stop short of God's basic demands, and so of the full provision He has
   made. I think we have by now seen clearly the inadequacy of this.

   Then there are those who go further and see that God has included them
   in the death of His Son on the Cross, in order to deliver them from sin
   and the Law by dealing with the old man. These are they who really
   exercise faith in the Lord, for they glory in Christ Jesus and have
   ceased to put confidence in the flesh (Phil. 3:3). In them God has a
   clear foundation on which to build. And from this as starting-point,
   many have gone further still and recognized that consecration (using
   that word in the right sense) means giving themselves without reserve
   into His hands and following Him. All these are first steps, and
   starting from them we have already touched upon other phases of
   experience set before us by God and enjoyed by many. It is always
   essential for us to remember that, while each of them is a precious
   fragment of truth, no single one of them is by itself the whole of
   truth. All come to us as the fruit of the work of Christ on the Cross,
   and we cannot afford to ignore any.
     __________________________________________________________________

A Gate And A Path

   Recognizing a number of such phases in the life and experience of a
   believer, we note now a further fact, namely that, though these phases
   do not necessarily occur always in a fixed and precise order, they seem
   to be marked by certain recurring steps or features. What are these
   steps? First there is revelation. As we have seen, this always precedes
   faith and experience. Through His Word God opens our eyes to the truth
   of some fact concerning His Son, and then only, as in Faith we accept
   that fact for ourselves, does it become actual as experience in our
   lives. Thus we have:
    1. Revelation (Objective).
    2. Experience (Subjective).

   Then further, we note that such experience usually takes the two-fold
   form of a crisis leading to a continuous process. It is most helpful to
   think of this in terms of John Bunyan's wicket gate' through which
   Christian entered upon a narrow path'. Our Lord Jesus spoke of such a
   gate and a path leading unto life (Matt. 7:14), and experience accords
   with this. So now we have:
    1. Revelation.
    2. Experience:
         1. A Wicket gate (Crisis)
         2. A narrow path (Process)

   Now let us take some of the subjects we have been dealing with and see
   how this helps us to understand them. We will take first our
   justification and new birth. This begins with a revelation of the Lord
   Jesus in His atoning work for our sins on the Cross; there follows the
   crisis of repentance and faith (the wicket gate), whereby we are
   initially "made nigh" to God (Eph. 2:13); and this leads us into a walk
   of maintained fellowship with Him (the narrow path), for which the
   ground of our day-to-day access is still the precious Blood (Heb.
   10:29, 22). When we come to deliverance from sin, we again have three
   steps: the Holy Spirit's work of revelation, or knowing' (Rom. 6:6);
   the crisis of faith, or reckoning' (Rom. 6:11); and the continuing
   process of consecration, or presenting ourselves' to God (Rom. 6:13) on
   the basis of a walk in newness of life. Consider next the gift of the
   Holy Spirit. This too begins with a new seeing' of the Lord Jesus as
   exalted to the throne, which issues in the dual experience of the
   Spirit outpoured and the Spirit indwelling. Going a stage further, to
   the matter of pleasing God, we find again the need for spiritual
   illumination, that we may see the values of the Cross in regard to the
   flesh'--the entire self-life of man. Our acceptance of this by faith
   leads at once to a wicket gate' experience (Rom. 7:25), in which we
   initially cease from doing' and accept by faith the mighty working of
   the life of Christ to satisfy God's practical demands in us. This in
   turn leads us into the narrow path' of a walk in obedience to the
   Spirit (Rom. 8:4).

   The picture is not identical in each case, and we must beware of
   forcing any rigid pattern upon the Holy Spirit's working; but perhaps
   any new experience will come to us more or less on these lines. There
   will certainly always be first an opening of our eyes to some new
   aspect of Christ and His finished work, and then faith will open a gate
   into a pathway. Remember, too, that our division of Christian
   experience into various subjects: justification, new birth, the gift of
   the spirit, deliverance, sanctification, etc., is for our clearer
   understanding only. It does not mean that these stages must or will
   always follow one another in a certain prescribed order. In fact, if a
   full presentation of Christ and His Cross is made to us at the very
   outset, we may well step into a great deal of experience from the first
   day of our Christian life, even though the full explanation of much of
   it may follow later. Would that all Gospel preaching were of such a
   kind!

   One thing is certain, that revelation will always precede faith. When
   we see something that God has done in Christ our natural response is:
   Thank you, Lord !' and faith follows spontaneously. Revelation is
   always the work of the Holy Spirit, who is given to come along-side
   and, by opening the Scriptures to us, to guide us into all the truth
   (John 16:13). Count upon Him, for He is here for that very thing; and
   when such difficulties as lack of understanding or lack of faith
   confront you, address those difficulties directly to the Lord: Lord,
   open my eyes. Lord, make this new thing clear to me. Lord, help Thou my
   unbelief!' He will not fail you.

The Fourfold Work Of Christ In His Cross

   We are now in a position to go a step further still and to consider how
   great a range is compassed by the Cross of the Lord Jesus Christ. In
   the light of Christian experience and for the purpose of analysis, it
   may help us if we recognize four aspects of God's redemptive work. But
   in doing so it is essential to keep in mind that the Cross of Christ is
   one Divine work--not many. Once in Judaea two thousand years ago the
   Lord Jesus died and rose again, and He is now "by the right hand of God
   exalted" (Acts 2:33). The work is finished and need never be repeated,
   nor can it be added to.

   Of the four aspects of the Cross which we shall now mention, we have
   already dealt with three in some detail. The last will be considered in
   the two succeeding chapters of our study. They may be briefly
   summarized as follows:
    1. The Blood of Christ to deal with sins and guilt.
    2. The Cross of Christ to deal with sin, the flesh and the natural
       man.
    3. The Life of Christ made available to indwell, re-create and empower
       man.
    4. The Working of Death in the natural man that that indwelling Life
       may be progressively manifest.

   The first two of these aspects are remedial. They relate to the undoing
   of the work of the Devil and the undoing of the sin of man. The last
   two are not remedial but positive, and relate more directly to the
   securing of the purpose of God. The first two are concerned with
   recovering what Adam lost by the Fall; the last two are concerned with
   bringing us into, and bringing into us, something that Adam never had.
   Thus we see that the achievement of the Lord Jesus in His death and
   resurrection comprises both a work which provided for the redemption of
   man and a work which made possible the realization of the purpose of
   God.

   We have dealt at some length in earlier chapters with the two aspects
   of His death represented by the Blood for sins and guilt and the Cross
   for sin and the flesh. In our discussion of the eternal purpose we have
   also looked briefly at the third aspect--that represented by Christ as
   the grain of wheat--and in our last chapter, in our consideration of
   Christ as our life, we have seen something of its practical outworking.
   Before, however, we pass on to the fourth aspect, which I shall call
   bearing the cross', we must say a little more about this third side,
   namely, the release of the life of Christ in resurrection for man's
   indwelling and empowering for service.

   We have spoken already of the purpose of God in creation and have said
   that it embraced far more than Adam ever came to enjoy. What was that
   purpose? God wanted to have a race of men whose members were gifted
   with a spirit whereby communion would be possible with Himself, who is
   Spirit. That race, possessing God's own life, was to co-operate in
   securing His purposed end by defeating every possible uprising of the
   enemy and undoing his evil works. That was the great plan. How will it
   now be effected? The answer is again to be found in the death of the
   Lord Jesus. It is a mighty death. It is something positive and
   purposive, going far beyond the recovery of a lost position; for by it,
   not only are sin and the old man dealt with and their effects annulled,
   but something more, something infinitely greater is introduced.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Love Of Christ

   Now we must have before us two passages of the Word, one from Genesis 2
   and one from Ephesians 5, which are of great importance in this
   connection.

   "And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he
   slept; and he took one of his ribs, which the Lord God had taken from
   the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And the man
   said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be
   called Woman (Heb. ishshah), because she was taken out of Man (Heb.
   ish)" (Gen. 2:21-23).

   "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and
   gave himself up for it; that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it
   by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the church
   to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such
   thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:25-27).

   In Ephesians 5 we have the only chapter in the Bible which explains the
   passage in Genesis 2. What we have presented to us in Ephesians is
   indeed very remarkable, if we reflect upon it. I refer to what is
   contained in those words: "Christ... loved the church". There is
   something most precious here.

   We have been taught to think of ourselves as sinners needing
   redemption. For generations that has been instilled into us, and we
   praise the Lord for that as our beginning; but it is not what God has
   in view as His end. God speaks here rather of "a glorious church, not
   having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but... holy and without
   blemish". All too often we have thought of the Church as being merely
   so many saved sinners'. It is that; but we have made the terms almost
   equal to one another, as though it were only that, which is not the
   case. Saved sinners--with that thought you have the whole background of
   sin and the Fall; but in God's sight the Church is a Divine creation in
   His Son. The one is largely individual, the other corporate. With the
   one the view is negative, belonging to the past; with the other it is
   positive, looking forward. The "eternal purpose" is something in the
   mind of God from eternity concerning His Son, and it has as its
   objective that the Son should have a Body to express His life. Viewed
   from that standpoint--from the standpoint of the heart of God--the
   Church is something which is beyond sin and has never been touched by
   sin.

   So we have an aspect of the death of the Lord Jesus in Ephesians which
   we do not have so clearly in other places. In Romans things are viewed
   from the standpoint of fallen man, and beginning with Christ died for
   sinners, enemies, the ungodly' (Rom. 5) we are led progressively to
   "the love of Christ" (Rom. 8:35). In Ephesians, on the other hand, the
   standpoint is that of God "before the foundation of the world" (Eph.
   1:4), and the heart of the gospel is: "Christ... loved the church, and
   gave himself up for it" (Eph. 5:25). Thus, in Romans it is "we sinned",
   and the message is of God's love for sinners (Rom. 5:8); whereas in
   Ephesians it is "Christ loved", and the love here is the love of
   husband for wife. That kind of love has fundamentally nothing to do
   with sin as such. What is in view in this passage is not atonement for
   sin but the creation of the Church, for which end it is said that He
   "gave himself".

   There is thus an aspect of the death of the Lord Jesus which is
   altogether positive and a matter particularly of love to His Church,
   where the question of sin and sinners does not directly appear. To
   bring this fact home Paul takes that incident in Genesis 2 as
   illustration. Now this is one of the marvelous things in the Word, and
   if our eyes have been opened to see it we will certainly worship.

   From Genesis 3 onwards, from the coats of skins' to Abel's sacrifice,
   and on from there through the whole Old Testament, there are numerous
   types which set forth the death of the Lord Jesus as an atonement for
   sin; yet the apostle does not appeal here to any of those types of His
   death, but to this one in Genesis 2. Note that; and then recall that it
   was not until Genesis 3 that sin came in. There is one type of the
   death of Christ in the Old Testament which has nothing to do with sin,
   for it is not subsequent to the Fall but prior to it, and that type is
   here in Genesis 2. Let us look at it for a moment.

   Could we say that Adam was put to sleep because Eve had committed a
   serious sin? Is that what we have here? Certainly not, for Eve was not
   yet even created. There were as yet no moral issues involved and no
   problems at all. No, Adam was put to sleep for the express purpose that
   something might be taken out of him to be made into someone else. His
   sleep was not for her sin but for her existence. That is what is taught
   in these verses. This experience of Adam had as its object the creation
   of Eve, as something determined in the Divine counsels. God wanted an
   ishshah. He put the man (ish) to sleep, took a rib from his side and
   made it into ishshah, a woman, and brought her to the man. That is the
   picture which God is giving us. It foreshadows an aspect of the death
   of the Lord Jesus that is not primarily for atonement, but answerable
   to the sleep of Adam in this chapter.

   God forbid that I should suggest that the Lord Jesus did not die for
   purposes of atonement. Praise God, He did. We must remember that today
   we are in fact in Ephesians 5 and not in Genesis 2. Ephesians was
   written after the Fall, to men who had suffered from its effects, and
   in it we have not only the purpose in Creation but also the scars of
   the Fall --or there would need to be no mention of "spot or wrinkle".
   Because we are still on the earth and the Fall is a historic fact,
   cleansing' is needed.

   But we must always view redemption as an interruption, an emergence'
   measure, made necessary by a catastrophic break in the straight line of
   the purpose of God. Redemption is big enough, wonderful enough, to
   occupy a very large place in our vision, but God is saying that we
   should not make redemption to be everything, as though man were created
   to be redeemed. The Fall is indeed a tragic dip downwards in that line
   of purpose, and the atonement a blessed recovery whereby our sins are
   blotted out and we are restored; but when it is accomplished there yet
   remains a work to be done to bring us into possession of that which
   Adam never possessed, and to give God that which His heart desires. For
   God has never forsaken the purpose which is represented by that
   straight line. Adam was never in possession of the life of God as
   presented in the tree of life. But because of the one work of the Lord
   Jesus in His death and resurrection (and we must emphasize again that
   it is all one work) His life was released to become ours by faith, and
   we have received more than Adam ever possessed. The very purpose of God
   is brought within reach of fulfillment by our receiving Christ as our
   life.

   Adam was put to sleep. We remember that it is said of believers that
   they fall asleep, rather than that they die. Why? Because whenever
   death is mentioned sin is there in the background. In Genesis 3 sin
   entered into the world and death through sin, but Adam's sleep preceded
   that. So the type of the Lord Jesus here is not like other types on the
   Old Testament. In relation to sin and atonement there is a lamb or a
   bullock slain; but here Adam was not slain, but only put to sleep to
   awake again. Thus he prefigures a death that is not on account of sin,
   but that has in view increase in resurrection. Then too we must note
   that Eve was not created as a separate entity by a separate creation,
   parallel to that of Adam. Adam slept, and Eve was created out of Adam.
   That is God's method with the Church. God's second Man' has awakened
   from His sleep' and His Church is created in Him and of Him, to draw
   her life from Him and to display that resurrection life.

   God has a Son who is known to be the only begotten, and God is seeking
   that the only begotten Son should have brethren. From the position of
   only begotten He will become the first begotten, and instead of the Son
   alone God will have many sons. One grain of wheat has died and many
   grains will spring up. The first grain was once the only grain; now it
   is changed to be the first grain of many. The Lord Jesus laid down His
   life, and that life emerged in many lives. These are the Biblical
   figures we have used hitherto in our study to express this truth. Now,
   in the figure just considered, the singular takes the place of the
   plural. The outcome of the Cross is a single person: a Bride for the
   Son. Christ loved the Church and gave Himself up for it.
     __________________________________________________________________

One Living Sacrifice

   We have said that there is an aspect of the death of Christ presented
   to us in Ephesians 5 which is to some extent different from that which
   we have been studying in Romans. Yet in fact this aspect is the very
   end to which our study of Romans has been moving, and it is into this
   that the letter is leading us as we shall now see, for redemption leads
   us back into God's original line of purpose.

   In chapter 8 Paul speaks to us of Christ as the firstborn Son among
   many Spirit-led "sons of God" (Rom. 8:14). "For whom he foreknew, he
   also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he
   might be the firstborn among many brethren: and whom he foreordained,
   them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and
   whom he justified, them he also glorified" (Rom. 8:29, 30). Here
   justification is seen to lead on to glory, a glory that is expressed
   not in one or more individuals but in a plurality: in many who manifest
   the image of One. And this object of our redemption is further set
   forth, as we have seen, in "the love of Christ" for His own, which is
   the subject of the last verses of the chapter (8:35-39). But what is
   implicit here in chapter 8 becomes explicit as we move over into
   chapter 12, the subject of which is the Body of Christ.

   After the first eight chapters of Romans, which we have been studying,
   there follows a parenthesis in which God's sovereign dealings with
   Israel are taken up and dealt with, before the theme of the first
   chapters is resumed. Thus, for our present purpose, the argument of
   chapter 12 follows that of chapter 8 and not of chapter 11. We might
   very simply summarize these chapters thus: Our sins are forgiven (ch.
   5), we are dead with Christ (ch. 6), we are by nature utterly helpless
   (ch. 7), therefore we rely upon the indwelling Spirit (ch. 8). After
   this, and as a consequence of it: "We... are one body in Christ" (ch.
   12). It is as though this were the logical outcome of all that has gone
   before, and the thing to which it has all been leading.

   Romans 12 and the following chapter contain some very practical
   instructions for our life and walk. These are introduced with an
   emphasis once again on consecration. In chapter 6:13 Paul has said:
   "Present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members
   as instruments of righteousness unto God". But now in chapter 12:1 the
   emphasis is a little different: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
   the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
   acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service". This new appeal
   for consecration is made to us as "brethren", linking us in thought to
   the "many brethren" of chapter 8:29. It is a call to us for a united
   step of faith, the presenting of our bodies as one "living sacrifice"
   unto God.

   This is something that goes beyond the merely individual, for it
   implies contribution to a whole. The presenting' is personal but the
   sacrifice is corporate; it is one sacrifice. Intelligent service to God
   is one service. We need never feel our contribution is not needed, for
   if it contributes to the service, God is satisfied. And it is through
   this kind of service that we prove "what is the good and acceptable and
   perfect will of God" (ch. 12:2), or, in other words, realize God's
   eternal purpose in Christ Jesus. So Paul's appeal "to every man that is
   among you" (12:3) is in the light of this new Divine fact, that "we,
   who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of
   another" (12:5), and it is on this basis that the practical
   instructions follow.

   The vessel through which the Lord Jesus can reveal Himself in this
   generation is not the individual but the Body. "God hath dealt to each
   man a measure of faith" (12:3), but alone in isolation man can never
   fulfill God's purpose. It requires a complete Body to attain to the
   stature of Christ and to display His glory. Oh that we might really see
   this!

   So Romans 12:3-6 draws from the figure of the human body the lesson of
   our inter-dependence. Individual Christians are not the Body but are
   members of the Body, and in a human body "all the members have not the
   same office". The ear must not imagine itself to be an eye. No amount
   of prayer will give sight to the ear--but the whole body can see
   through the eye. So (speaking figuratively) I may have only the gift of
   hearing, but I can see through others who have the gift of sight; or,
   perhaps I can walk but cannot work, so I receive help from the hands.
   An all-too-common attitude to the things of the Lord is that, What I
   know, I know; and what I don't know, I don't know, and can do quite
   well without.' But in Christ, the things we do not know others do, and
   we may know them and enter into the enjoyment of them through others.

   Let me stress that this is not just a comfortable thought. It is a
   vital factor in the life of God's people. We cannot get along without
   one another. That is why fellowship in prayer is so important. Prayer
   together brings in the help of the Body, as must be clear from Matthew
   18:19, 20. Trusting the Lord by myself may not be enough. I must trust
   Him with others. I must learn to pray "Our Father..." on the basis of
   oneness with the Body, for without the help of the Body I cannot get
   through. In the sphere of service this is even more apparent. Alone I
   cannot serve the Lord effectively, and He will spare no pains to teach
   me this. He will bring things to an end, allowing doors to close and
   leaving me ineffectively knocking my head against a blank wall until I
   realize that I need the help of the Body as well as of the Lord. For
   the life of Christ is the life of the Body, and His gifts are given to
   us for work that builds up the Body.

   The Body is not an illustration but a fact. The Bible does not just say
   that the Church is like a body, but that it is the Body of Christ. "We,
   who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of
   another." All the members together are one Body, for all share His
   life--as though He were Himself distributed among His members. I was
   once with a group of Chinese believers who found it very hard to
   understand how the Body could be one when they were all separate
   individual men and women who made it up. One Sunday I was about to
   break the bread at the Lord's table and I asked them to look very
   carefully at the loaf before I broke it. Then, after it had been
   distributed and eaten, I pointed out that though it was inside all of
   them it was still one loaf--not many. The loaf was divided, but Christ
   is not divided even in the sense in which that loaf was. He is still
   one Spirit in us, and we are all one in Him.

   This is the very opposite of man's condition by nature. In Adam I have
   the life of Adam, but that is essentially individual. There is no
   union, no fellowship in sin, but only self-interest and distrust of
   others. As I go on with the Lord I soon discover, not only that the
   problem of sin and of my natural strength has to be dealt with, but
   that there is also a further problem created by my individual' life,
   the life that is sufficient in itself and does not recognize its need
   for and union in the Body. I may have got over the problems of sin and
   the flesh, and yet still be a confirmed individualist. I want holiness
   and victory and fruitfulness for myself personally and apart, albeit
   from the purest motives. but such an attitude ignores the Body, and so
   cannot provide God with satisfaction. he must deal with me therefore in
   this matter also, or I shall remain in conflict with His ends. God does
   not blame me for being an individual, but for my individualism. His
   greatest problem is not the outward divisions and denominations that
   divide His Church but our own individualistic hearts.

   Yes, the Cross must do its work here, reminding me that in Christ I
   have died to that old life of independence which I inherited from Adam,
   and that in resurrection I have become not just an individual believer
   in Christ but a member of His Body. There is a vast difference between
   the two. When I see this, I shall at once have done with independence
   and shall seek fellowship. The life of Christ in me will gravitate to
   the life of Christ in others. I can no longer take an individual line.
   Jealousy will go. Competition will go. Private work will go. My
   interests, my ambitions, my preferences, all will go. It will no longer
   matter which of us does the work. All that will matter will be that the
   Body grows.

   I said: When I see this...' That is the great need: to see the Body of
   Christ as another great Divine fact; to have it break in upon our
   spirits by heavenly revelation that "we, who are many, are one body in
   Christ". Only the Holy Spirit can bring this home to us in all its
   meaning, but when He does it will revolutionize our life and work.
     __________________________________________________________________

More Than Conquerors Through Him

   We only see history back to the Fall. God sees it from the beginning.
   There was something in God's mind before the Fall, and in the ages to
   come that thing is to be fully realized. God knew all about sin and
   redemption; yet in His great purpose for the Church set forth in
   Genesis 2 there is no view of sin. It is as though (to speak in finite
   terms) He leaps in thought right over the whole story of redemption and
   sees the Church in future eternity, having a ministry and a (future)
   history which is altogether apart from sin and wholly of God. It is the
   Body of Christ in glory, expressing nothing of fallen man but only that
   which is the image of the glorified Son of man. This is the Church that
   has satisfied God's heart and has attained dominion.

   In Ephesians 5 we stand within the history of redemption, and yet
   through grace we still have this eternal purpose of God in view as
   expressed in the statement that He will present unto himself a glorious
   Church'. But now we note that the water of life and the cleansing Word
   are needed to prepare the Church (now marred by the Fall) for
   presentation to Christ in glory. For now there are defects to be
   remedied and wounds to be healed. And yet how precious is the promise
   and how gracious are the words used of her: "not having spot"--the
   scars of sin, whose very history is now forgotten; "or wrinkle"--the
   marks of age and of time lost, for all is now made up and all is new;
   and "without blemish"--so that Satan or demons or men can find no
   ground for blame in her.

   This is where we are now. The age is closing, and Satan's power is
   greater than ever. Our warfare is with angels and principalities and
   powers (Rom. 8:38; Eph. 6:12) who are set to withstand and destroy the
   work of God in us by laying many things to the charge of God's elect.
   Alone we could never be their match, but what we alone cannot do the
   Church can. Sin, self-reliance and individualism were Satan's
   master-strokes at the heart of God's purpose in man, and in the Cross
   God has undone them. As we put our faith in what He has done--in "God
   that justifieth" and in "Christ Jesus that died" (Rom. 8:33, 34)--we
   present a front against which the very gates of Hades shall not
   prevail. We, His Church, are "more than conquerors through him that
   loved us" (Rom. 8:37).

Chapter 12: The Cross and the Soul Life

   God has made full provision for our redemption in the Cross of Christ,
   but He has not stopped there. In that Cross He has also made secure
   beyond possibility of failure that eternal plan which Paul speaks of as
   having been from all the ages "hid in God who created all things". That
   plan He has now proclaimed "to the intent that now unto the
   principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made
   known through the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the
   eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Eph.
   3:9-11).

   We have said that the work of the Cross has two consequences which bear
   directly upon the realizing of that purpose in us. On the one hand it
   has issued in the release of His life that it may find expression in us
   through the indwelling Spirit. On the other hand it has made possible
   what we speak of as bearing the cross'; that is, our co-operation in
   the daily inworking of His death whereby way is made in us for the
   manifestation of that new life, through the bringing of the natural
   man' progressively into his right place of subjection to the Holy
   Spirit. Clearly these are the positive and the negative sides of one
   thing. Equally clearly we are now touching more particularly on the
   matter of progress in a life lived for God. Hitherto in dealing with
   the Christian life we have placed our main emphasis upon the crisis by
   which it is entered. Now our concern is more definitely with the walk
   of the disciple, having especially in view his training as a servant of
   God. It is of him that the Lord Jesus said: "Whosoever doth not bear
   his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:27).

   So we come to a consideration of the natural man and the bearing of the
   cross'. To understand this we must, at the risk of being tedious, go
   back once more to Genesis and consider what it was that God sought to
   have in man at the beginning and how His purpose was frustrated. In
   this way we shall be able to grasp the principles by which we can come
   again to live in line with that purpose.
     __________________________________________________________________

The True Nature Of The Fall

   If we have even a little revelation of the plan of God we shall always
   think much of the word man'. We shall say with the Psalmist, "What is
   man, that thou art mindful of him?" The Bible makes it clear that what
   God desires above all things is a man--a man who will be after His own
   heart.

   So God created a man. In Genesis 2:7 we learn that Adam was created a
   living soul, with a spirit inside to commune with God and with a body
   outside to have contact with the material world. (Such New Testament
   verses as 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12 confirm this threefold
   character of man's being.) With his spirit Adam was in touch with the
   spiritual world of God; with his body he was in touch with the physical
   world of material things. He gathered up these two sides of God's
   creative act into himself to become a personality, an entity living in
   the world, moving by itself and having powers of free choice. Viewed
   thus as a whole, he was found to be a self-conscious and
   self-expressing being, "a living soul".

   We saw earlier that Adam was created perfect--by which we mean that he
   was without imperfections because created by God--but that he was not
   yet perfected. He needed a finishing touch somewhere. God had not yet
   done all that He intended to do in Adam. There was more in view, but it
   was as yet in abeyance. God was moving towards the fulfillment of His
   purpose in creating man, a purpose which went beyond man himself, for
   it had in view the securing to God of all His rights in the universe
   through man's instrumentality. But how could man be instrumental in
   this? Only by a co-operation that sprang from living union with God.
   God was seeking to have not merely a race of men of one blood upon the
   earth, but a race which had, in addition, His life resident within its
   members. Such a race will eventually compass the downfall of Satan and
   bring to fulfillment all that God has set His heart upon. It is that
   that was in view with the creation of man.

   Then again, we saw that Adam was created neutral. He had a spirit which
   enabled him to hold communion with God; but as man he was not yet, so
   to speak, finally orientated; he had powers of choice and he could, if
   he liked, turn the opposite way. God's goal in man was sonship', or, in
   other words, the expression of His life in human beings. That Divine
   life was represented in the garden by the tree of life, bearing a fruit
   that could be accepted, received, taken in. If Adam, created neutral,
   were voluntarily to turn that way and, choosing dependence upon God,
   were to receive of the tree of life (representing God's own life), God
   would then have that life in union with men; He would have realized
   sonship'. But if instead Adam should turn to the tree of the knowledge
   of good and evil, he would as a result be free' to develop himself on
   his own lines apart from God. Because, however, this latter choice
   involved complicity with Satan, Adam would thereby put beyond his reach
   the attaining of his God-appointed goal.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Root Question: The Human Soul

   Now we know the course that Adam chose. Standing between the two trees,
   he yielded to Satan and took of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.
   This determined the lines of his development. From then on he could
   command a knowledge; he knew'. But--and here we come to the point--the
   fruit of the tree of knowledge made the first man over-developed in his
   soul. The emotion was touched, because the fruit was pleasant to the
   eyes, making him desire'; the mind with its reasoning power was
   developed, for he was made wise'; and the will was strengthened, so
   that in future he could always decide which way he would go. The whole
   fruit ministered to the expansion and full development of the soul, so
   that not only was the man a living soul, but from henceforth man will
   live by the soul. It is not merely that man has a soul, but that from
   that day on the soul, with its independent powers of free choice, takes
   the place of the spirit as the animating power of man.

   We have to distinguish here between two things, for the difference is
   most important. God does not mind--in fact He intends--that we should
   have a soul such as He gave to Adam. But what God has set Himself to do
   is to reverse something. There is something in man today which is not
   just the fact of having a soul, but which constitutes a living by the
   soul. It was this that Satan brought about in the Fall. He trapped man
   into taking a course by which he could develop his soul so as to derive
   his very life from it.

   We must however be careful. To remedy this does not mean that we are
   going to cross out the soul altogether. You cannot do that. When today
   the Cross is really working in us, we do not become inert, insensate,
   characterless. No, we still possess a soul, and whenever we receive
   something from God the soul will still be used in relation to it, as an
   instrument, a faculty, in a true subjection to Him. But the point is,
   Are we keeping within God's appointed limit--within the bounds set by
   Him in the Garden at the beginning--with regard to the soul, or are we
   getting outside those bounds?

   What God is now doing is the pruning work of the vinedresser. In our
   souls there is an uncontrolled development, an untimely growth, that
   has to be checked and dealt with. God must cut that off. So now there
   are two things before us to which our eyes must be opened. On the one
   hand God is seeking to bring us to the place where we live by the life
   of His Son. On the other hand He is doing a direct work in our hearts
   to undo that other natural resource that is the result of the fruit of
   knowledge. Every day we are learning these two lessons: a rising up of
   the life of this One, and a checking and a handing over to death of
   that other soul-life. These two processes go on all the time, for God
   is seeking the fully developed life of His Son in us in order to
   manifest Himself, and to that end He is bringing us back, as to our
   soul, to Adam's starting-point. So Paul says: "We which live are always
   delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may
   be manifested in our mortal flesh" (2 Cor. 4:11).

   What does this mean? It simply means that I will not take any action
   without relying on God. I will find no sufficiency in myself. I will
   not take any step just because I have the power to do so. Even though I
   have that inherited power within me, I will not use it; I will put no
   reliance in myself. By taking the fruit, Adam became possessed of an
   inherent power to act, but a power which played right into Satan's
   hands. You lose that power to act when you come to know the Lord. The
   Lord cuts it off and you find you can no longer act on your own
   initiative. You have to live by the life of Another; you have to draw
   everything from Him.

   Oh, friends, I think we all know ourselves in measure, but many a time
   we do not truly tremble at ourselves. We may, in a manner of courtesy
   to God, say: If the Lord does not want it, I cannot do it', but in
   reality our subconscious thought is that really we can do it quite well
   ourselves, even if God does not ask us to do it nor empower us for it.
   Too often we have been caused to act, to think, to decide, to have
   power, apart from Him. Many of us Christians today are men with
   over-developed souls. We have grown too big in ourselves. We have
   become big-souled'. When we are in that condition, the life of the Son
   of God in us is confined and almost crowded out of action.
     __________________________________________________________________

Natural Energy In The Work Of God

   The power, the energy of the soul is present with us all. Those who
   have been taught by the Lord repudiate that principle as a life
   principle; they refuse to live by it; they will not let it reign, nor
   allow it to be the power-spring of the work of God. But those who have
   not been taught of God rely upon it; they utilize it; they think it is
   the power.

   Let us take first an obvious illustration of this. Far too many of us
   in the past have reasoned as follows. Here is a delightfully
   good-natured man, with a clear brain, splendid managing powers and
   sound judgment. In our hearts we say, If that man could be a Christian,
   what an asset he would be to the Church! If only he were the Lord's,
   what a lot it would mean to His cause!'

   But think for a moment. Where did that man's good nature come from?
   Whence are those splendid managing powers and that good judgment? Not
   form new birth, for he is not yet born again. We know we have all been
   born of the flesh; therefore we need a new birth. But the Lord Jesus
   had something to say about this in John 3:6: "That which is born of the
   flesh is flesh". Everything which comes not by new birth but by natural
   birth is flesh and will only bring glory to man, not God. That
   statement is not very palatable, but it is true.

   We have spoken of soul-power or natural energy. What is this natural
   energy? It is simply what I can do, what I am of myself, what I have
   inherited of natural gifts and resources. We are none of us without the
   power of the soul, and our first need is to recognize it for what it
   is.

   Take for example the human mind. I may have by nature a keen mind.
   Before my new birth I had it naturally, as something developed from my
   natural birth. But the trouble arises here. I become converted, I am
   born anew, a deep work is effected in my spirit, and essential union
   with God that has been set up in my spirit, but at the same time I
   carry over with me something which I derive from my natural birth. Now
   what am I going to do about it?

   The natural tendency is this. Formerly I used to use my mind to pore
   over history, over business, over chemistry, over questions of the
   world, or literature, or poetry. I used my keen mind to get the best
   out of those studies. But now my desire has been changed, so henceforth
   I employ the same mind in the things of God. I have therefore changed
   my subject of interest, but I have not changed my method of working.
   That is the whole point. My interests have been utterly changed (praise
   God for that!), but now I utilize the same power to study Corinthians
   and Ephesians that I used before to pursue history and geography. But
   that power is not of God; and God will not allow that. The trouble with
   so many of us is that we have changed the channel into which our
   energies are directed, but we have not changed the source of those
   energies.

   You will find there are many such things which we carry over into the
   service of God. Consider the matter of eloquence. There are some men
   who are born orators; they can present a case very convincingly indeed.
   Then they become converted, and, without asking ourselves where they
   really stand in relation to spiritual things, we put them on the
   platform and make preachers of them. We encourage them to use their
   natural powers for preaching, and again it is a change of subject but
   the same power. We forget that, in the matter of our resource for
   handling the things of God, it is a question not of comparative value
   but of origin--of where the resource springs from. It is not so much a
   matter of what we are doing, but of what powers we are employing to do
   it. We think too little of the source of our energy and too much of the
   end to which it is directed, forgetting that with God the end never
   justifies the means.

   The following hypothetical case will help us to test the truth of our
   argument. Mr. A. is a very good speaker: he can talk fluently and most
   convincingly on any subject, but in practical things he is a very bad
   manager. Mr. B., on the other hand, is a poor speaker: he cannot
   express himself clearly but wanders all round his subject, never coming
   to a point; yet on the other hand he is a splendid manager, most
   competent in all matters of business. Both these men get converted, and
   both become earnest Christians. Let us suppose now that I call on them
   both and ask them to speak at a convention, and that both accept.

   Now what will happen? I have asked the self-same thing of both men, but
   who do you think will pray the harder? Certainly Mr. B. Why? Because he
   is no speaker. In the matter of eloquence he has no resources of his
   own to depend upon. He will pray: Lord, if you do not give me power for
   this, I cannot do it'. Of course Mr. A. will pray too, but maybe not in
   the same way as Mr. B. because he has something of natural resource
   upon which to rely.

   Now let us suppose that, instead of asking them to speak, I ask them
   both to take charge of the practical side of affairs at the convention.
   What will happen? The position will be exactly reversed. Now it will be
   Mr. A.s turn to pray hard, for he knows full well that he has no
   organizing ability. Mr. B. of course will pray too, but perhaps without
   quite the same urgency, for though he knows his need of the Lord he is
   not nearly so conscious of his need in business matters as is Mr. A.

   Do you see the difference between natural and spiritual gifts? Anything
   we can do without prayer and without an utter dependence upon God must
   come from that spring of natural life, and is suspect. We must see this
   clearly. Of course it is not true that those only are suited for a
   particular work who lack the natural gift for it. The point is that,
   whether naturally gifted or not, they must know the touch of the Cross
   in death upon all that is of nature, and their complete dependence upon
   the God of resurrection. All too readily do we envy our neighbor who
   has some outstanding natural gift, and fail to realize that our own
   possession of it, apart from such a working of the Cross, may easily
   prove a barrier to the very thing that God is seeking to manifest in
   us.

   Shortly after my conversion I went out preaching in the villages. I had
   had a good education and was well versed in the Scriptures, so I
   considered myself thoroughly capable of instructing the village folk,
   among whom were quite a number of illiterate women. But after several
   visits I discovered that, despite their illiteracy, those women hand an
   intimate knowledge of the Lord. I knew the Book they haltingly read;
   they knew the One of whom the Book spoke. I had much in the flesh; they
   had much in the Spirit. How many Christian teachers today are teaching
   others as I was then, very largely in the strength of their carnal
   equipment!

   Once I met a young brother--young, that is to say, in years, but who
   had learned a good deal of the Lord. The Lord had brought him through
   much tribulation to gain that knowledge of Himself. As I was talking to
   him I said, Brother, what has the Lord really been teaching you these
   days?' He said, Only one thing: that I can do nothing apart from him.'
   Do you really mean', I said, that you can do nothing?' Well, no', he
   replied. I can do many things! In fact that has been just my trouble.
   Oh, you know, I have always been so confident in myself. I know I am
   well able to do lots of things.' So I asked, What then do you mean when
   you say you can do nothing apart from Him?' He answered, The Lord has
   shown me that I can do anything, but that He has said, "Apart from me
   ye can do nothing". So it comes to this, that everything I have done
   and can do apart from Him is nothing!'

   We have to come to that valuation. I do not mean to say we cannot do a
   lot of things, for we can. We can take meetings, and build churches, we
   can go to the ends of the earth and found missions, and we can seem to
   bear fruit; but remember that the Lord's word is: "Every plant which my
   heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up" (Matt. 15:13). God is
   the only legitimate Originator in the universe (Gen. 1:1). Anything
   that you plan and set on foot has its origin in the flesh, and it will
   never reach the realm of the Spirit however earnestly you seek God's
   blessing on it. It may last for years, and then you may think you will
   adjust here and improve there and maybe bring it on a better plane, but
   it cannot be done.

   Origin determines destination, and what was "of the flesh" originally
   will never be made spiritual by any amount of improvement'. That which
   is born of the flesh is flesh, and it will never be otherwise. Anything
   for which we are sufficient in ourselves is nothing' in God's estimate,
   and we have to accept His estimate and write it down as nothing. "The
   flesh profiteth nothing." It is only what comes from above that will
   abide.

   We cannot see this simply by being told it. God must teach us what is
   meant, by putting His finger on something which He sees and saying:
   This is natural; this has its source in the old creation; this cannot
   abide.' Until He does so, we may agree in principle but we can never
   really see it. We may assent to, and even enjoy, the teaching, but we
   shall never truly loathe ourselves.

   But there will come a day when God opens our eyes. Facing a particular
   issue we shall have to say, as by revelation: It is unclean, it is
   impure; Lord, I see it!' The word purity' is a blessed word. I always
   associate it with the Spirit. Purity means something altogether of the
   Spirit. Impurity means mixture. When God opens our eyes to see that the
   natural life is something He can never use in His work, then we find we
   do not enjoy the doctrine any longer. Rather we loathe ourselves for
   the impurity that is in us; but when that point is reached, God begins
   His work of deliverance. We are going on shortly to look at the
   provision He has made for that deliverance, but we must stay for a
   little longer with this matter of revelation.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Light Of God And Knowledge

   Of course, if one does not set out to serve the Lord whole-heartedly,
   one does not feel the necessity for light. It is only when one has been
   apprehended by God, and seeks to go forward with Him, that one finds
   how necessary light is. There is a fundamental need of light in order
   for us to know the mind of God; to know what is of the spirit and what
   is of the soul; to know what is Divine and what is merely of man; to
   discern what is truly heavenly and what is only earthly; to understand
   the difference between things which are spiritual and things which are
   carnal; to know whether God is really leading us or whether we are
   walking by our feelings, senses or imaginations. It is when we have
   reached a position where we would like to follow God fully that we find
   light to be the most necessary thing in the Christian life.

   In my conversations with younger brothers and sisters one question
   comes up again and again. It is: How can I know that I am walking in
   the Spirit? How do I distinguish which prompting within me is from the
   Holy Spirit and which is from myself? It seems that all are alike in
   this; but some have gone further. They are trying to look within, to
   differentiate, to discriminate to analyze, and in doing so are bringing
   themselves into deeper bondage. Now this is a situation which is really
   dangerous to Christian life, for inward knowledge will never be reached
   along the barren path of self-analysis.

   We are never told in the Word of God to examine our inward condition.
   [15] That way ends only to uncertainty, vacillation and despair. Of
   course we have to have self-knowledge. We have to know what is going on
   within. We do not want to live in a fool's paradise; to have gone
   altogether wrong and yet not know we have gone wrong; to have a spartan
   will and yet think we are pursuing the will of God. But such
   self-knowledge does not come by our turning within; by our analyzing
   our feelings and motives and everything that is going on inside, and
   then trying to pronounce whether we are walking in the flesh or in the
   Spirit.

   There are several passages in the Psalms which illumine this subject.
   The first is in Psalm 36:9: "In thy light shall we see light". I think
   that is one of the best verses in the old Testament. There are two
   lights there. There is "thy light", and then, when we have come into
   that light, we shall "see light".

   Now those two lights are different. We might say that the first is
   objective and the second subjective. The first light is the light which
   belongs to God but is shed upon us; the second is the knowledge
   imparted by that light. "In thy light shall we see light": we shall
   know something; we shall be clear about something; we shall see. No
   turning within, no introspective self-examination will ever bring us to
   that clear place. No, it is when there is light coming from God that we
   see.

   I think it is so simple. If we want to satisfy ourselves that our face
   is clean, what do we do? Do we feel it carefully all over with our
   hands? No, of course not. We find a mirror and we bring it to the
   light. In that light everything becomes clear. No sight ever came by
   feeling or analyzing. Sight only comes by the light of God coming in;
   and when once it has come, there is no longer need to ask if a thing is
   right or wrong. We know.

   You remember again how in Psalm 139:23 the writer says: "Search me, O
   God, and know my heart". You realize, do you not, what it means to say
   Search me'? It certainly does not mean that I search myself. Search me'
   means You search me!' That is the way of illumination. It is for God to
   come in and search; it is not for me to search. Of course that will
   never mean that I may go blindly on, careless of my true condition.
   That is not the point. The point is that however much my
   self-examination may reveal in me that needs putting right, such
   searching never really gets below the surface. My true knowledge of
   self comes not from my searching myself but from God searching me.

   But, you ask, what does it mean in practice for us to come into the
   light? How does it work? How do we see light in His light? Here again
   the Psalmist comes to our help. "The entrance of Thy words giveth
   light; it giveth understanding unto the simple" (Psalm 119:130 A.V.).
   In spiritual things we are all simple'. We are dependent upon God to
   give us understanding, and especially is this so in the matter of our
   own true nature. And it is here that the Word of God operates. In the
   New Testament the passage which states this most clearly is in the
   Epistle to the Hebrews: "The word of God is living, and active, and
   sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of
   soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the
   thoughts and intents of the heart. And there is no creature that is not
   manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before
   the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (Heb. 4:12, 13). Yes, it is
   the Word of God, the penetrating Scripture of Truth, that settles our
   questions. It is that which discerns our motives and defines for us
   their true source in soul or spirit.

   With this I think we can pass on from the doctrinal to the practical
   side of things. Many of us, I am sure, are living quite honestly before
   God. We have been making progress, and we do not know of anything much
   wrong with us. Then one day, as we go on, we meet with a fulfillment of
   that word: "The entrance of Thy words giveth light". Some servant of
   God has been used by Him to confront us with His living Word, and that
   Word has made an entrance into us. Or perhaps we ourselves have been
   waiting before God and, whether from our memory of Scripture or from
   the page itself, His Word has come to us in power. Then it is we see
   something which we have never seen before. We are convicted. We know
   where we are wrong, and we look up and confess: Lord, I see it. There
   is impurity there. There is mixture. How blind I was! Just fancy that
   for so many years I have been wrong there and have never known it!'
   Light comes in and we see light. The light of God brings us to see the
   light concerning ourselves, and it is an abiding principle that every
   knowledge of self comes to us in that way.

   It may not always be the Scriptures. Some of us have known saints who
   really knew the Lord, and through praying with them or talking with
   them, in the light of God radiating from them, we have seen something
   which we never saw before. I have met one such, who is now with the
   Lord, and I always think of her as a lighted' Christian. If I did but
   walk into her room, I was brought immediately to a sense of God. In
   those days I was very young and had been converted about two years, and
   I had lots of plans, lots of beautiful thoughts, lots of schemes for
   the Lord to sanction, a hundred and one things which I thought would be
   marvelous if they were all brought to fruition. With all these things I
   came to her to try to persuade her; to tell her that this or that was
   the thing to do.

   Before I could open my mouth she would just say a few words in quite an
   ordinary way. Light dawned! It simply put me to shame. My doing' was
   all so natural, so full of man. Something happened. I was brought to a
   place where I could say: Lord, my mind is set only in creaturely
   activities, but here is someone who is not out for them at all'. She
   had but one motive, one desire, and that was for God. Written in the
   front of her Bible were these words: Lord, I want nothing for myself',
   Yes, she lived for God alone, and where that is the case you will find
   that such a one is bathed in light, and that that light illuminates
   others. That is real witness. [16] Light has one law: it shines
   wherever it is admitted. That is the only requirement. We may shut it
   out of ourselves; it fears nothing else. If we throw ourselves open to
   God, He will reveal. The trouble comes when we have closed areas,
   locked and barred places in our hearts, where we think with pride that
   we are right. Our defeat lies then not only in our being wrong but in
   our not knowing that we are wrong. Wrong may be a question of natural
   strength; ignorance of it is a question of light. You can see the
   natural strength in some but they cannot see it themselves. Oh, we need
   to be sincere and humble, and to open ourselves before God! Those who
   are open can see. God is light, and we cannot live in His light and be
   without understanding. Let us say again with the Psalmist: "O send out
   Thy light and Thy truth: let them lead me" (Psalm 43:3).

   We praise God that sin is being brought to the notice of Christians
   today more than hitherto. In many places the eyes of Christians have
   been opened to see that victory over sins, as items, is important in
   Christian life, and in consequence many are walking closer to the Lord
   in seeking deliverance and victory over them. Praise the Lord for any
   movement toward Himself, any movement back to real holiness unto God!
   But that is not enough. There is one thing that must be touched, and
   that is the very life of the man, not merely his sins. The question of
   the personality of the man, of his soul-power, is the heart of the
   matter. To make the question of sins to be everything is still to be on
   the surface. Holiness, if you only regard sins, is still something on
   the outside, still superficial. You have not yet got to the root of the
   evil.

   Adam did not let sin into the world by committing murder. That came
   later. Adam let in sin by choosing to have his soul developed to a
   place where he cold go on by himself apart from God. When, therefore,
   God secures a race of men who will be to His glory, and who will be His
   instrument to accomplish His purpose in the universe, they will be a
   people whose life--yea, whose very breath--is dependent upon Him. He
   will be the "tree of life" to them.

   What I feel more and more the need of in myself, and what I feel that
   we all as the Lord's children need to seek from God, is a real
   revelation of ourselves. I repeat that I do not mean we should be for
   ever looking in on ourselves and asking: Now, is this soul or is it
   spirit?' That will never get us anywhere; it is darkness. No, Scripture
   shows us how the saints were brought to self-knowledge. It was always
   by light from God, and that light is God Himself. Isaiah, Ezekiel,
   Daniel, Peter, Paul, John, all came to a knowledge of themselves
   because the Lord flashed Himself upon them, and that flash brought
   revelation and conviction. (Isa. 6:5; Ezek. 1:28; Dan. 10:8; Luke
   22:61, 62; Acts 9:3-5; Rev. 1:17).

   We can never know the hatefulness of sin and the hatefulness of
   ourselves unless there is that flash of God upon us. I speak not of a
   sensation but of an inward revelation of the Lord Himself through His
   Word. It does for us what doctrine alone can never do.

   Christ is our light. He is the living Word, and when we read the
   Scriptures that life in Him brings revelation. "The life was the light
   of men" (John 1:4). Such illumination may not come to us all at once,
   but gradually; but it will be more and more clear and searching, until
   we see ourselves in the light of God and all our self-confidence is
   gone. For light is the purest thing in the world. It cleanses. It
   sterilizes. It kills what should not be there. In its radiance the
   dividing asunder of joints and marrow' becomes to us a fact and no mere
   teaching. We know fear and trembling as we recognize the corruption of
   man's nature, the hatefulness of our own selves, and the real threat to
   the work of God of our unrestrained soul-life and energy. As never
   before, we know how much of us needs God's drastic dealing if He is to
   use us, and we know that, apart from Him, as servants of God we are
   finished.

   But here the Cross, in its widest meaning, will come to our help again,
   and we shall seek now to examine an aspect of its work which meets and
   deals with our problem of the human soul. For only a thorough
   understanding of the Cross can bring us to that place of dependence
   which the Lord Jesus Himself voluntarily took when He said: "I can of
   myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous;
   because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me"
   (John 5:30).

   [15] The two apparent exceptions to this are found in 1 Corinthians

   to discern ourselves as to whether we recognize the Lord's body or not,
   and this is in particular connection with the Lord's table. It is not
   concerned with self-knowledge as such. The strong command of Paul in
   the latter passage is to examine ourselves as to whether or not we are
   "in the faith". It is a question of the existence or otherwise in us of
   a fundamental faith; of whether, in fact, we are Christians. This is in
   no way related to our daily walk in the Spirit, or to

Chapter 13: The Path of Progress: Bearing the Cross

   In our previous chapter we have touched several times upon the matter
   of service for the Lord. As we come now to look at the provision that
   God has made to meet the problem created by the soul-life of man, it
   will be helpful if we approach that problem by considering first the
   principles which govern our work for Him and from which no one who
   tries to serve Him may deviate. The basis of our salvation, as we well
   know, is the fact of our Lord's death and resurrection; but the
   conditions of our service are no less definite. Just as the fact of the
   death and resurrection of the Lord is the ground of our acceptance with
   God, so the principle of death and resurrection is the basis of our
   life and service for Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Basis Of All True Ministry

   No one can be a true servant of God without knowing the principle of
   death and the principle of resurrection. Even the Lord Jesus Himself
   served on that basis. You will find in Matthew 3 that, before His
   public ministry ever began, our Lord was baptized. He was baptized not
   because He had any sin, or anything which needed cleansing. No, we know
   the meaning of baptism: it is a figure of death and resurrection. The
   ministry of the Lord did not begin until He was on that ground. After
   He had been baptized and had voluntarily taken the ground of death and
   resurrection, the Holy Spirit came upon Him, and then He ministered.

   What does this teach us? Our Lord was a sinless Man. None but He has
   trodden this earth and known no sin. Yet as Man He had a separate
   personality from His Father. Now we must tread very carefully when we
   touch our Lord; but remember His words: "I seek not mine own will, but
   the will of him that sent me". What does this mean? It certainly does
   not mean that the Lord had no will of His own. He had a will, as His
   own words show. As Son of man He had a will, but He did not do it; He
   came to do the will of the Father. So this is the point. That thing in
   Him which is in distinction from the Father is the human soul, which He
   assumed when He was "found in fashion as a man". Being a perfect Man
   our Lord had a soul, and of course a body, just as you and I have a
   soul and a body, and it was possible for Him to act from the soul--that
   is, from Himself.

   You remember that immediately after the Lord's baptism, and before His
   public ministry began, Satan came and tempted Him. He tempted Him to
   satisfy His essential needs by turning stones to bread; to secure
   immediate respect for His ministry by appearing miraculously in the
   temple court; to assume without delay the world dominion destined for
   Him; and you are inclined to wonder why he tempted Him to do such
   strange things. He might rather, you feel, have tempted Him to sin in a
   more thoroughgoing way. But he did not; he knew better. He only said:
   "If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread".
   What did it mean? The implication was this: If You are the Son of God
   You must do something to prove it. Here is a challenge. Some will
   certainly raise a question as to whether Your claim is real or not. Why
   do You not settle the matter finally now by coming out and proving it?'

   The whole subtle object of Satan was to get the Lord to act for
   Himself--that is, from the soul--and, by the stand He took, the Lord
   Jesus absolutely repudiated such action. In Adam, man had acted from
   himself apart from God; that was the whole tragedy of the garden. Now
   in a similar situation the Son of man takes another ground. Later He
   defines it as His basic life-principle--and I like the word in the
   Greek: "The Son can do nothing out from himself" (John 5:19). That
   total denial of the soul-life was to govern all His ministry.

   So we can safely say that all the work which the Lord Jesus did on
   earth, prior to His actual death on the cross, was done with the
   principle of death on the cross, and resurrection as basis, even though
   as an actual event Calvary still lay in the future. Everything He did
   was on that ground. But if this is so--if the Son of man has to go
   through death and resurrection (in figure and in principle) in order to
   work, can we do otherwise? Surely no servant of the Lord can serve Him
   without himself knowing the working of that principle in his life. It
   is of course out of the question. The Lord made this very clear to His
   disciples when He left them. He had died and He was risen, and He told
   them to wait in Jerusalem for the Spirit to come upon them. Now what is
   this power of the Holy Spirit, this "power from on high" of which He
   spoke? It is nothing less than the virtue of His death, resurrection
   and ascension. To use another figure, the Holy Spirit is the Vessel in
   whom all the values of the death, resurrection and exaltation of the
   Lord are deposited, that they may be brought to us. He is the one who
   contains' those values and mediates them to men. That is the reason why
   the Spirit could not be given before the Lord had been glorified. Then
   only could He rest upon men and women that they might witness; and
   without the values of the death and resurrection of Christ no such
   witness is possible.

   If we turn to the Old Testament we find the same thing is there. I
   would refer you to a familiar passage in the seventeenth chapter of
   Numbers. The matter of Aaron's ministry has been contested. There is a
   question among the people as to whether Aaron is truly the chosen of
   God. They have entertained a suspicion, and have said in effect:
   Whether that man is ordained of God or not, we do not know!' and so God
   sets out to prove who is His servant and who is not. How does He do so?
   Twelve dead rods are put before the Lord in the sanctuary over against
   the testimony, and they are there for a night. Then, in the morning,
   the Lord indicates His chosen minister by the rod which buds, blossoms
   and bears fruit.

   We all know the meaning of that. The budding rod speaks of
   resurrection. It is death and resurrection that marks God-recognized
   ministry. Without that you have nothing. The budding of Aaron's rod
   proved him to be on a true basis, and God will only recognize as His
   ministers those who have come through death to resurrection ground.

   We have seen that the death of the Lord works in different ways and has
   different aspects. We know how His death has worked in regard to the
   forgiveness of our sins. We all know that our forgiveness is based upon
   the shed Blood, and that without the shedding of Blood there is no
   remission. Then we have come further and in Romans 6 have seen how
   death works to meet the power of sin. We have learned that our old man
   has been crucified in order that henceforth we should not serve sin,
   and we have praised the Lord that here too His death has worked for our
   deliverance. Further on still the question of human self-will arises,
   and the need for consecration is apparent; and we find death working
   that way to bring about in us a willingness to let go our own wills and
   obey the Lord. That indeed constitutes a starting point for our
   ministry, but still it does not touch the core of the question. There
   may still be the lack of knowledge of what is meant by the soul.

   Then another phase is presented to us in Romans 7 where the question of
   holiness of life is in view--a living, personal holiness. There you
   find a true man of God trying to please God in righteousness, and he
   comes under the law and the law finds him out. He is trying to please
   God by using his own carnal power, and the Cross has to bring him to
   the place where he says, I cannot do it. I cannot satisfy God with my
   powers; I can only trust the Holy Spirit to do that in me.' I believe
   some of us have passed through deep waters to learn this, and to
   discover the value of the death of the Lord working in this way.

   Now mark you, there is still a great difference between "the flesh", as
   spoken of in Romans 7 in relation to holiness of life, and the working
   of the natural energies of the soul-life in the service of the Lord.
   With all the above being known--and known in experience--there still
   remains this one sphere more which the death of the Lord must enter
   before we are actually of use to Him in service. Even with all these
   experiences we are still unsafe for Him to use until this further thing
   is effected in us. How many of God's servants are used by Him, as we
   say in China, to build twelve feet of wall, only, when they have done
   so, to undo it all by themselves pulling down fifteen feet! We are used
   in a sense, but at the same time we destroy our own work, and sometimes
   that of others also, because of there being somewhere something undealt
   with by the Cross.

   Now we have to see how the Lord has set out to deal with the soul, and
   then more particularly how this touches the question of our service for
   Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Subjective Working Of The Cross

   We must keep before us now four passages from the Gospels. They are:
   Matthew 10:34-39; Mark 8:32-35; Luke 17:32-34; and John 12:24-26. These
   four passages have something in common. In each you have the Lord
   Himself speaking to us concerning the soul-activity of man, and in each
   a different aspect or manifestation of the soul-life is touched upon.
   In these verses He makes it very plain that the soul of man can be
   dealt with in one way and in one way only, and that is by our bearing
   the cross daily and following Him.

   As we have just seen, the soul-life or natural life that is here in
   view is something further than what we have in those passages which are
   concerned with the old man or the flesh. We have sought to make quite
   clear that, in respect of our old man, God emphasizes the thing He has
   done once for all in crucifying us with Christ on the Cross. We have
   seen that three times in the Epistle to the Galatians the crucifying'
   aspect of the Cross is referred to as a thing accomplished; and in
   Romans 6:6 we have the clear statement that "our old man was
   crucified", which, if the tense of the word means anything, we might
   well paraphrase: Our old man has been finally and for ever crucified'.
   It is something done, to be apprehended by Divine revelation and then
   appropriated by faith.

   But there is a further aspect of the Cross, namely that implied in the
   expression bearing his cross daily', which is before us now. The Cross
   has borne me; now I must bear it; and this bearing of the Cross is an
   inward thing. It is this that we mean when we speak of the subjective
   working of the Cross'. Moreover it is a daily process; it is a step by
   step following after Him. It is this which is now brought before us in
   relation to the soul, and let us note that the emphasis here is not
   quite the same as with the old man. We do not have here the
   crucifixion' of the soul itself, in the sense that our natural gifts
   and faculties, our personality and our individuality, are to be put
   away altogether. Were it so it could hardly be said of us, as it is in
   Hebrews 10:39, that we are to "have faith unto the saving of the soul".
   (Compare 1 Peter 1:9; Luke 21:19.) No, we do not lose our souls in this
   sense, for to do so would be to lose our individual existence
   completely. The soul is still there with its natural endowments, but
   the Cross is brought to bear upon it to bring those natural endowments
   into death--to put the mark of His death upon them--and thereafter, as
   God may please, to give them back to us in resurrection.

   It is in this sense that Paul, writing to the Philippians, expresses
   the desire "that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
   the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death"
   (Phil. 3:10). The mark of death is upon the soul all the time to bring
   it to the place where it is always subordinate to the Spirit and never
   independently asserts itself. Only the Cross, working in such a way,
   could make a man of the calibre of Paul, and with the natural resources
   hinted at in Philippians 3, so distrust his own natural strength that
   he could write to the Corinthians: "I determined not to know anything
   among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I was with you in
   weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. And my speech and my
   preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration
   of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the
   wisdom of men, but in the power of God" (1 Cor. 2:2, 5).

   The soul is the seat of the affections, and what a great part of our
   decisions and actions is influenced by these! There is nothing
   deliberately sinful about them, mind you, but it is simply that there
   is something in us which can go out in natural affection to another
   person and which as a result can influence wrongly our whole course of
   action. So in the first of the four passages before us the Lord has to
   say: "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me;
   and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
   And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy
   of me" (Matt. 10:37, 38). You note that to follow the Lord in the way
   of the Cross is set before us as His normal, His only way for us. What
   immediately follows? "He that findeth his soul shall lose it; and he
   that loseth his soul for my sake shall find it" (Matt. 10:39, mg.).

   The secret danger lies in that subtle working of the affections to turn
   us away from the pathway of God; and the key to the matter is the soul.
   The Cross has to deal with that. I have to "lose" my soul in the sense
   in which the Lord meant those words, and which we are seeking here to
   explain.

   Some of us know well what it means to lose our soul. We can no longer
   fulfill its desire; we cannot give in to it; we cannot gratify it: that
   is the loss' of the soul. We are going through a painful process to
   discourage what the soul is asking for. And many a time we have to
   confess that it is not any definite sin that is keeping us from
   following the Lord to the end. We are held up because of some secret
   love somewhere, some perfectly natural affection diverting our course.
   Yes, affection plays a great part in our lives, and the Cross has to
   come in there and do its work.

   Then we pass to the reference in Mark chapter 8. I think that is a most
   important passage. Our Lord had just taught His disciples at Caesarea
   Philippi that He was going to suffer death at the hands of the elders
   of the Jews, and then Peter, with all his love for his Master, came up
   and rebuked Him and said to Him: Lord, do not do it; pity Thyself: this
   shall never come to Thee!' Out of his love for the Lord he appealed to
   Him to spare Himself; and the Lord rebuked Peter, as He would rebuke
   Satan, for caring for the things of men and not the things of God. And
   then to all present the word was spoken once more: "If any man would
   come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
   me. For whosoever will save his soul shall lose it; and whosoever shall
   lose his soul for my sake and the gospel's shall save it" (Mark 8:34,
   35, mg.).

   The whole question at issue is again that of the soul, and here it is
   particularly of the soul's desire for self-preservation. There is that
   subtle working of the soul which says, If I could be allowed to live I
   would do anything, be willing for anything; but I must be kept alive!'
   There you have the soul almost crying out for help. Going to the Cross,
   being crucified--oh that is really too much! Have mercy on yourself;
   pity yourself! Do you mean to say you are going against yourself and
   going with God?' Some of us know well that in order to go on with God
   we have many a time to go against the voice of the soul- our own or
   other people's--and to let the Cross come in to silence that appeal for
   self-preservation.

   Am I afraid of the will of God? The dear saint whom I have already
   mentioned as having had such an influence upon the course of my life,
   many times asked me the question: Do you like the will of God?' It is a
   tremendous question. She did not ask, Do you do the will of God?' she
   always asked, Do you like the will of God?' That question cuts deeper
   than anything else. I remember once she was having a controversy with
   the Lord over a certain matter. She knew what the Lord wanted, and in
   her heart she wanted it too. But is was difficult, and I heard her pray
   like this: Lord, I confess I don't like it, but please do not give in
   to me. Just wait, Lord--and I will give in to Thee.' She did not want
   the Lord to yield to her and to reduce His demands upon her. She wanted
   nothing but to please Him.

   Many a time we have to come to the place where we are willing to let go
   things we think to be good and precious--yes, and even, it may be, the
   very things of God themselves--that His will may be done. Peter's
   concern was for his Lord and was dictated by his natural love for Him.
   We might feel that Peter had a marvelous love for his Lord, sufficient
   even for him to dare to rebuke Him. Only a strong love could bring one
   to attempt that! Yes, but when there is purity of spirit without that
   mixture of soul, you will not be led into Peter's mistake. You will
   recognize the will of God and you will find that that is what your
   heart delights in alone. You will no longer even shed a tear in
   sympathy with the flesh. Yes, the Cross cuts deeply, and we see here
   once more how utterly it has to deal with the soul.

   Once again the Lord Jesus deals with the matter of the soul in Luke
   chapter 17, and now it is in relation to His return. Speaking of "the
   day that the Son of man is revealed", He draws a parallel between that
   day and "the day that Lot went out from Sodom" (verses 29, 30). A
   little later He speaks of the rapture' in the twice repeated words:
   "One shall be taken, and the other shall be left" (verses 34, 35). But
   between His reference to the calling of Lot out of Sodom and this
   allusion to the rapture, the Lord says these remarkable words: "In that
   day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let
   him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field
   likewise not return back. Remember Lot's wife" (verses 31, 32).
   Remember Lot's wife! Why? because "whosoever shall seek to gain his
   soul shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose his soul shall save it
   alive" (verse 33, mg.).

   If I mistake not, this is the one passage in the New Testament that
   tells of our reaction to the rapture call. We may have thought that
   when the Son of man comes we shall be taken up automatically, as it
   were, because of what we read in 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52: "We shall all
   be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
   trump..." Well, however we reconcile the two passages, this one in
   Luke's Gospel should at least make us pause and reflect; for the
   emphasis is here very strongly upon one being taken and the other left.
   It is a matter of our reaction to the call to go, and on the basis of
   this a most urgent appeal is made to us to be ready (compare Matt.
   24:42).

   There is surely a reason for this. Clearly that call is not going to
   produce a miraculous last-minute change in us out of all relation to
   our previous walk with the Lord. No, in that moment we shall discover
   our heart's real treasure. If it is the Lord Himself, then there will
   be no backward look. A backward glance decides everything. It is so
   easy to become more attached to the gifts of God than to the Giver--and
   even, I should add, to the work of God than to God Himself.

   Let me illustrate. At the present time [17] I am writing a book. I have
   finished eight chapters and I have another nine to write, about which I
   am very seriously exercised before the Lord. But if the call to come up
   hither' should come and my reaction were to be What about my book?' the
   answer might well be, All right, stay down and finish it!' That
   precious thing which we are doing downstairs in the house' can be
   enough to pin us down, a peg that holds us to earth.

   It is all a question of our living by the soul or by the spirit. Here
   in this passage in Luke, we have depicted the soul-life in its
   engagement with the things of the earth--and mark you, not sinful
   things either. The Lord only mentioned marrying, planting, eating,
   selling--all perfectly legitimate activities with which there is
   nothing essentially wrong. But it is occupation with them, so that your
   heart goes out to them, that is enough to pin you down. The way out of
   that danger is by the losing of the soul. This is beautifully
   illustrated in the action of Peter when he recognized the risen Lord
   Jesus by the lake-side. Though with the others he had returned to his
   former employment, there was now no thought of the ship, nor even of
   the net full of fishes so miraculously provided. When he heard John's
   cry of recognition: "it is the Lord", we read that "he cast himself
   into the sea".

   That is true detachment. The question at issue is always, Where is my
   heart? The cross has to work in us a true spiritual detachment from
   anything and anyone outside of the Lord Himself.

   But, even here, we are as yet only dealing with the more outward
   aspects of the soul's activity. The soul giving rein to its affections,
   the soul asserting itself and trying to manipulate things, the soul
   becoming preoccupied with things, the soul becoming preoccupied with
   things on the earth: these are still small things, and do not yet touch
   the real heart of the matter. There is something which is deeper yet,
   and which I will try now to explain.

The Cross And Fruitfulness

   Let us read again John 12:24, 25. "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by
   itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. He that loveth his
   life (Greek soul', as in the above passages) loseth it; and he that
   hateth his life (soul') in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."

   Here we have the inward working of the Cross of which we have been
   speaking--the losing of the soul--linked with and likened to that
   aspect of the death of the Lord Jesus Himself which we have already
   seen depicted in the grain of wheat, namely, His death with a view to
   increase. The end in view is fruitfulness. There is a grain of wheat
   with life in it, but "it abideth alone". It has the power to impart its
   life to others; but to do so it must go down into death.

   Now we know the way the Lord Jesus took. He passed into death, and, as
   we saw earlier, His life emerged in many lives. The Son died, and came
   forth as the first of "many sons". He let go His life that we might
   receive it. It is in this aspect of His death that we are called to
   die. It is here that He makes clear the value of conformity to His
   death, which is that we lose our own natural life, our soul, in order
   that we may become life-imparters, sharing thereafter with others the
   new life of God which is in us. This is the secret of ministry, the
   path of real fruitfulness to God. As Paul says: "We which live are
   always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of
   Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death worketh in
   us, but life in you" (2 Cor. 4:11, 12).

   We are coming to our point. There is new life in us, if we have
   received Christ. We all have that precious possession, the treasure in
   the vessel. Praise the Lord for the reality of His life within us! But
   why is there so little expression of that life? Why is there an abiding
   alone'? Why is it not overflowing and imparting life to others? Why is
   it scarcely making itself apparent even in our own lives? The reason
   why there is so little sign of life where life is present is that the
   soul in us is enveloping and confining that life (as the husk envelopes
   the grain of wheat) so that it cannot find outlet. We are living in the
   soul; we are working and serving in our own natural strength; we are
   not drawing from God. It is the soul that stands in the way of the
   springing up of life. Lose it; for that way lies fullness.

A Dark Night--A Resurrection Morn

   So we come back to the almond rod, which was brought into the sanctuary
   for a night--a dark night in which there was nothing to be seen--and
   then in the morning it budded. There you have set forth the death and
   resurrection, the life yielded up and the life fained, and there you
   have the ministry attested. But how does this work out in practice? How
   do I recognize that God is dealing with me in this way?

   First we must be clear about one thing: the soul with its fund of
   natural energy and resource will continue with us until our death. Till
   then there will be an unending day-by-day need for the Cross to operate
   in us, dredging deeply that well-spring of nature. This is the
   life-long condition of service that is laid down in the words: "Let him
   deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me" (Mark 8:34). We
   never get past that. He who evades it "is not worthy of me" (Matt.
   10:38); he "cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:27). Death and resurrection
   must remain an abiding principle of our lives for the losing of the
   soul and the uprising of the Spirit.

   Yet here too there may be a crisis that, once reached and passed, can
   transform our whole life and service for God. It is a wicket gate by
   which we may enter upon an entirely new pathway. Such a crisis occurred
   in the life of Jacob at Peniel. It was the natural man' in Jacob that
   was seeking to serve God and to attain His end. Jacob knew well that
   God had said: "The elder shall serve the younger", but he was trying to
   compass that end through his own ingenuity and resource. God had to
   cripple that strength of nature in Jacob, and that He did when He
   touched the sinew of Jacob's thigh. Jacob continued to walk thereafter,
   but he continued to be lame. He was a different Jacob, as his change of
   name implies. He had his feet and he could use them, but the strength
   had been touched, and he limped from an injury from which he would
   never quite recover.

   God must bring us to a point--I cannot tell you how it will be, but He
   will do it--where, through a deep and dark experience, our natural
   power is touched and fundamentally weakened, so that we no longer dare
   trust ourselves. He has had to deal with some of us very harshly, and
   take us through difficult and painful ways, in order to get us there.
   At length there comes a time when we no longer like' to do Christian
   work--indeed we almost dread to do things in the Lord's Name. But then
   at last it is that He can begin to use us.

   I can tell you this, that for a year after I was converted I had a lust
   to preach. It was impossible to stay silent. It was as though there was
   something moving within me that drove me forward, and I had to keep
   going. Preaching had become my very life. The Lord may graciously allow
   you to go on a long while like that--and not only so but with a fair
   measure of blessing--until one day that natural force impelling you is
   touched, and from then on you no longer do it because you want to do it
   but because the Lord wants it. Before that experience you preached for
   the sake of satisfaction you got from serving God in that way; and yet
   sometimes the Lord could not move you to do one thing that He wanted
   done. You were living by the natural life, and that life varies a good
   deal. It is the slave of your temperament. When emotionally you are set
   on His way you go ahead at full speed, but when your emotions are
   directed the other way you are reluctant to move at all, even when duty
   calls. You are not pliable in the Lord's hands. He has therefore to
   weaken that strength of preference, of like and dislike, in you, until
   you will do a thing because He wants it and not because you like it.
   You may enjoy it or you may not, but you will do it just the same. It
   is not that you can derive a certain satisfaction from preaching or
   from doing this or that work for God, and therefore you do it. No, you
   do it now because it is the will of God, and regardless of whether or
   not it gives you conscious joy. The true joy you know in doing His will
   lies deeper than your variable emotions.

   God is bringing you to the place where He has but to express a wish and
   you respond instantly. That is the spirit of the Servant (Psalm 40:7,
   8), but such a spirit does not come naturally to any of us. It comes
   only when our soul, the seat of our natural energy and will and
   affections, has known the touch of the Cross. Yet such a servant-spirit
   is what He seeks and will have in us all. The way to it may be a
   painful, long-drawn-out process with some of us, or it may be just one
   stroke; but God has His ways and we must have regard to them.

   Every true servant of God must know at some time that disabling from
   which he can never recover; he can never be quite the same again. There
   must be that established in you which means that from henceforth you
   will really fear yourself. You will fear to do anything out from'
   yourself, for, like Jacob, you know what kind of sovereign dealing you
   will incur if you do it; you know what a bad time you will have in your
   own heart before the Lord if you move out on the impulse of your soul.
   You have known something of the chastening hand of a loving God upon
   you, a God who "dealeth with you as with sons" (Heb. 12:7). The Spirit
   Himself bears witness in your spirit to that relationship, and to the
   inheritance and glory that are ours "if so be that we suffer with him"
   (Rom. 8:16, 17); and your response to the Father of our spirits' is:
   "Abba, Father".

   But when this is really established in you, you have come to a new
   place which we speak of as resurrection ground'. Death in principle may
   have had to be wrought out to a crisis in your natural life, but when
   it has, then you find God releases you into resurrection. You discover
   that what you have lost is coming back--though not as before. The
   principle of life is at work in you now--something that empowers and
   strengthens you, something that animates you, giving you life. From
   henceforth what you have lost will be brought back - but now under
   discipline, under control.

   Let me make this quite clear again. If we want to be spiritual people,
   there is no need for us to amputate our hands or feet; we can still
   have our body. In the same way we can have our soul, with the full use
   of its faculties; and yet the soul is not now our life-spring. We are
   no longer living in it, we are no longer drawing from it and living by
   it; we use it. When the body becomes our life we live like beasts. When
   the soul becomes our life we live as rebels and fugitives from God
   --gifted, cultured, educated, no doubt, but alienated from the life of
   God. But when we come to live our life in the Spirit and by the Spirit,
   though we still use our soul faculties just as we do our physical
   faculties, they are now the servants of the Spirit; and when we have
   reached that point God can really use us.

   But the difficulty with many of us is that dark night. The Lord
   graciously laid me aside once in my life for a number of months and put
   me, spiritually, into utter darkness. It was almost as though He had
   forsaken me--almost as though nothing was going on and I had really
   come to the end of everything. And then by degrees He brought things
   back again. The temptation is always to try to help God by taking
   things back ourselves; but remember, there must be a full night in the
   sanctuary--a full night in darkness. It cannot be hurried; He knows
   what He is doing.

   We would like to have death and resurrection put together within one
   hour of each other. We cannot face the thought that God will keep us
   aside for so long a time; we cannot bear to wait. And I cannot tell you
   how long He will take, but in principle I think it is quite safe to say
   this, that there will be a definite period when He will keep you there.
   It will seem as though nothing is happening; everything you valued is
   slipping from your grasp. There confronts you a blank wall with no door
   in it. Seemingly everyone else is being blessed and used, while you
   yourself have been passed by and are losing out. Lie quiet. All is in
   darkness, but it is only for a night. It must indeed be a full night,
   but that is all. Afterwards you will find that everything is given back
   to you in glorious resurrection; and nothing can measure the difference
   between what was before and what now is!

   I was sitting one day at supper with a young brother to whom the Lord
   had been speaking on this very question of our natural energy. He said
   to me, It is a blessed thing when you know the Lord has met you and
   touched you in that fundamental way, and that disabling touch has been
   received.' There was a plate of biscuits between us on the table, and I
   picked one up and broke it in half as though to eat it. Then, fitting
   the two pieces together again carefully, I said, It looks all right,
   but it is never quite the same again, is it? When once your back is
   broken, you will yield ever after to the slightest touch from God.'

   That is it. The Lord knows what He is doing with His own, and He has
   left no aspect of our need unmet in His Cross, that the glory of the
   Son may be manifested in the sons. Disciples who have gone this way
   can, I believe, truly echo the words of the apostle Paul, who could
   claim to serve God "in my spirit in the gospel of his Son" (Rom. 1:9).
   They have learned, as he had, the secret of such a ministry: "We...
   worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no
   confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3).

   Few can have led a more active life than Paul's. To the Romans he puts
   it on record that he has preached the Gospel from Jerusalem to
   Illyricum (Rom. 15:19) and that he is ready now to go on to Rome (1:10)
   and thence, if possible, to Spain (15:24, 28). Yet in all this service,
   embracing as it does the whole Mediterranean world, his heart is set on
   one object only--the uplifting of the One who has made it all possible.
   "I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to
   God. For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ
   wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and
   deed" (Rom. 15:17, 18). That is spiritual service.

   May God make each one of us, as truly as he was, "a bondservant of
   Jesus Christ".

Chapter 14: The Goal of the Gospel

   For our final chapter we will take as our starting-point an incident in
   the Gospels that occurs under the very shadow of the Cross--an incident
   that, in its details, is at once historic and prophetic.

   "And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat
   at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of
   spikenard very costly; and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his
   head... Jesus said... Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel
   shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this
   woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her" (Mark 14:3,
   6, 9).

   Thus the Lord ordained that the story of Mary anointing Him with that
   costly ointment should always accompany the story of the Gospel; that
   what Mary has done should always be coupled with what the Lord has
   done. That is His own statement. What does He intend that we should
   understand by it?

   I think we all know the story of Mary's action well. From the details
   given in John chapter 12, where the incident follows not long after her
   brother's restoration to life, we may gather that the family was not a
   specially wealthy one. The sisters had to work in the house themselves,
   for we are told that at this feast "Martha also served" (John 12:2 and
   compare Luke 10:40). [18] No doubt every penny mattered to them. Yet
   one of those sisters, Mary, having among her treasures an alabaster
   cruse containing three hundred pence' worth of ointment, expended the
   whole thing on the Lord. Human reasoning said this was really too much;
   it was giving the Lord more than His due. That is why Judas took the
   lead, and the other disciples supported him, in voicing a general
   complaint that Mary's action was a wasteful one.
     __________________________________________________________________

Waste

   "But there were some that had indignation among themselves, saying, To
   what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made? For this
   ointment might have been sold for above three hundred pence and given
   to the poor. And they murmured against her" (Mark 14:4, 5). These words
   bring us to what I believe the Lord would have us consider finally
   together, namely, that which is signified by the little word "waste".

   What is waste? Waste means, among other things, giving more than is
   necessary. If a shilling will do and you give a point, it is a waste.
   If two ounces will do and you give a kilogram, it is a waste. If three
   days will suffice to finish a task well enough and you lavish five days
   or a week on it, it is a waste. Waste means that you give something too
   much for something too little. If someone is receiving more than he is
   considered to be worth, then that is waste.

   But remember, we are dealing here with something which the Lord said
   had to go out with the Gospel, wherever that Gospel should be carried.
   Why? Because He intends that the preaching of the Gospel should issue
   in something along the very lines of the action of Mary here, namely,
   that people should come to Him and waste themselves on Him. This is the
   result that He is seeking.

   We must look at this question of wasting on the Lord from two angles:
   that of Judas (John 12:4-6) and that of the other disciples (Matt.
   26:8, 9); and for our present purpose we will run together the parallel
   accounts.

   All the twelve thought is a waste. To Judas of course, who had never
   called Jesus Lord', everything that was poured out upon Him was waste.
   Not only was ointment waste; even water would have been waste. Here
   Judas stands for the world. In the world's estimation the service of
   the Lord, and our giving ourselves to Him for such service, is sheer
   waste. He has never been loved, never had a place in the hearts of the
   world, so any giving to Him is a waste. Many say: Such-and-such a man
   could make good in the world if only he were not a Christian!' Because
   a man has some natural talent or other asset in the world's eyes, they
   count such people are really too good for the Lord. What waste of a
   useful life!' they say.

   Let me give a personal instance. In 1929 I returned from Shanghai to my
   home town of Foochow. One day I was walking along the street with a
   stick, very weak and in broken health, and I met one of my old college
   professors. He took me into a teashop where we sat down. He looked at
   me from head to foot and from foot to head, and then he said: Now look
   here; during your college days we thought a good deal of you and we had
   hopes that you would achieve something great. Do you mean to tell me
   that this is what you are?' Looking at me with penetrating eyes, he
   asked that very pointed question. I must confess that, on hearing it,
   my first desire was to break down and weep. My career, my health,
   everything had gone, and here was my old professor who taught me law in
   the school, asking me: Are you still in this condition, with no
   success, no progress, nothing to show?'

   But the very next moment--and I have to admit that in all my life it
   was the first time--I really knew what it meant to have the "spirit of
   glory" resting upon me. The thought of being able to pour our my life
   for my Lord flooded my soul with glory. Nothing short of the Spirit of
   glory was on me then. I could look up and without a reservation say:
   Lord, I praise Thee! This is the best thing possible; it is the right
   course that I have chosen!' To my professor it seemed a total waste to
   serve the Lord; but that is what the Gospel is for--to bring us to a
   true estimate of His worth.

   Judas felt it a waste. We could manage better with the money by using
   it in some other way. There are plenty of poor people. Why not rather
   give it for charity, do some social service for their uplift, help the
   poor in some practical way? Why pour it out at the feet of Jesus?' (See
   John 12:4-6.) That is always the way the world reasons. Can you not do
   something better with yourself than this? It is going a bit too far to
   give yourself altogether to the Lord!'

   But if the Lord is worthy, then how can it be a waste? He is worthy to
   be so served. He is worthy for me to be His prisoner. He is worthy for
   me just to live for Him. He is worthy! What the world says about this
   does not matter. The Lord says: Do not trouble her'. So let us not be
   troubled. Men may say what they like, but we can stand on this ground,
   that the Lord said: It is a good work. Every true work is not done on
   the poor; every true work is done to Me'. When once our eyes have been
   opened to the real worth of our Lord Jesus, nothing is too good for
   Him.

   But I do not want to dwell too much on Judas. Let us go on to see what
   was the attitude of the other disciples, because their reaction affects
   us even more than does his. We do not greatly mind what the world is
   saying; we can stand that, but we do very much mind what other
   Christians are saying who ought to understand. And yet we find that
   they said the same thing as Judas; and they not only said it but they
   were very upset, very indignant about it. "When the disciples saw it,
   they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this
   ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor" (Matt.
   26:8, 9).

   Of course we know that the attitude of mind is all too common among
   Christians which says, Get all you can for as little as possible'. That
   however is not what is in view here, but something deeper. Let me
   illustrate. Has someone been telling you that you are wasting your life
   be sitting still and not doing much? They say, Here are people who
   ought to get out into this or that kind of work. They could be used to
   help this or that group of people. Why are they not more active?'-- and
   in saying so, their whole idea is use. Everything ought to be used to
   the full in ways they understand.

   There are those who have been very concerned with some dear servants of
   the Lord on this very ground, that they are apparently not doing
   enough. They could do so much more, they think, if they could secure an
   entry somewhere and enjoy a greater acceptance and prominence in
   certain circles. They could then be used in a far greater way. I have
   spoken already of a sister whom I knew for a long time and who, I
   think, is the one by whom I have been helped most. She was used of the
   Lord in a very real way during those years when I was associated with
   her, though to some of us at the time this was not so apparent. The one
   concern in my heart was this: She is not used!' Constantly I said to
   myself, Why does she not get out and take some meetings, go somewhere,
   do something? It is a waste for her to be living in that small village
   with nothing happening!' Sometimes, when I went to see her, I almost
   shouted at her. I said, No one knows the Lord as you do. You know the
   Book in a most living way. Do you not see the need around? Why don't
   you do something? It is a waste of time, a waste of energy, a waste of
   money, a waste of everything, just sitting here and doing nothing!'

   But no, brethren, that is not the first thing with the Lord. He wants
   you and me to be used, certainly. God forbid that I should preach
   inactivity or seek to justify a complacent attitude to the world's
   need. As Jesus Himself says here, "the gospel shall be preached
   throughout the whole world". But the question is one of emphasis.
   Looking back today, I realize how greatly the Lord was in fact using
   that dear sister to speak to a number of us who, as young men, were at
   that time in His training school for this very work of the Gospel. I
   cannot thank God enough for her.

   What, then, is the secret? Clearly it is this, that in approving Mary's
   action at Bethany, the Lord Jesus was laying down one thing as a basis
   of all service: that you pour out all you have, your very self, unto
   Him; and if that should be all He allows you to do, that is enough. It
   is not first of all a question of whether the poor' have been helped or
   not. The first question is: Has the Lord been satisfied?

   There is many a meeting we might address, many a convention at which we
   might minister, many a Gospel campaign in which we might have a share.
   It is not that we are unable to do it. We could labor and be used to
   the full; but the Lord is not so concerned about our ceaseless
   occupation in work for Him. That is not His first object. The service
   of the Lord is not to be measured by tangible results. No, my friends,
   the Lord's first concern is with our position at His feet and our
   anointing of His head. Whatever we have as an alabaster box': the most
   precious thing, the thing dearest in the world to us--yes, let me say
   it, the outflow from us of a life that is produced by the very Cross
   itself--we give that all up to the Lord. To some, even of those who
   should understand, it seems a waste; but that is what He seeks above
   all. Often enough the giving to Him will be in tireless service, but He
   reserves to Himself the right to suspend the service for a time in
   order to discover to us whether it is that or Himself that holds us.
     __________________________________________________________________

Ministering To His Pleasure

   "Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached... that also which this woman
   hath done shall be spoken of" (Mark 14:9).

   Why did the Lord say this? Because the Gospel is meant to produce this.
   It is what the Gospel is for. The Gospel is not just to satisfy
   sinners. Praise the Lord, sinners will be satisfied! but their
   satisfaction is, we may say, a blessed by-product of the Gospel and not
   its primary aim. The Gospel is preached in the first place so that the
   Lord may be satisfied.

   I am afraid we lay too much emphasis on the good of sinners and we have
   not sufficiently appreciated what the Lord has in view as His goal. We
   have been thinking how the sinner will fare if there is no Gospel, but
   that is not the main consideration. Yes, Praise God! the sinner has his
   part. God meets his need and showers him with blessings; but that is
   not the most important thing. The first thing is this, that everything
   should be to the satisfaction of the Son of God. It is only when He is
   satisfied that we shall be satisfied and the sinner will be satisfied.
   I have never met a soul who has set out to satisfy the Lord and has not
   been satisfied himself. It is impossible. Our satisfaction comes
   unfailingly when we satisfy Him first.

   But we have to remember this, that He will never be satisfied without
   our wasting' ourselves upon Him. Have you ever given too much to the
   Lord? May I tell you something? One lesson some of us have come to
   learn is this, that in Divine service the principle of waste is the
   principle of power. The principle which determines usefulness is the
   very principle of scattering. Real usefulness in the hand of God is
   measured in terms of waste'. The more you think you can do, and the
   more you employ your gifts up to the very limit (and some even go over
   the limit!) in order to do it, the more you find that you are applying
   the principle of the world and not of the Lord. God's ways with us are
   all designed to establish in us this other principle, namely, that our
   work for Him springs out of our ministering to Him. I do not mean that
   we are going to do nothing; but the first thing for us must be the Lord
   Himself, not His work.

   But we must come down to very practical issues. You say: I have given
   up a position; I have given up a ministry; I have foregone certain
   attractive possibilities of a bright future, in order to go on with the
   Lord in this way. Now I try to serve Him. Sometimes it seems that the
   Lord hears me, and sometimes He keeps me waiting for a definite answer.
   Sometimes He uses me, but sometimes it seems that He passes my by.
   Then, when this is so, I compare myself with that other fellow who is
   in a certain big system. He too had a bright future, but he has never
   given it up. He continues on and he serves the Lord. He sees souls
   saved and the Lord blesses his ministry. He is successful--I do not
   mean materially, but spiritually--and I sometimes think he looks more
   like a Christian than I do, so happy, so satisfied. After all, what do
   I get out of this? He has a good time; I have all the bad time. He has
   never gone this way, and yet he has much that Christians today regard
   as spiritual prosperity, while I have all sorts of complications coming
   to me. What is the meaning of it all? Am I wasting my life? Have I
   really given too much?'

   So there is your problem. You feel that were you to follow in that
   other brother's steps--were you, shall we say, to consecrate yourself
   enough for the blessing but not enough for the trouble, enough for the
   Lord to use you but not enough for Him to shut you up--all would be
   perfectly all right. But would it? You know perfectly well that it
   would not.

   Takes your eyes off that other man! Look at your Lord, and ask yourself
   again what it is that He values most highly. The principle of waste is
   the principle that He would have govern us. She is doing this for Me.'
   Real satisfaction is brought to the heart of the Son of God only when
   we are really, as people would think, wasting' ourselves upon Him. It
   seems as though we are giving too much and getting nothing--and that is
   the secret of pleasing God.

   Oh, friends, what are we after? Are we after use' as those disciples
   were? They wanted to make every penny of those three hundred pence go
   to its full length. The whole question was one of obvious usefulness'
   to God in terms that could be measured and put on record. The Lord
   waits to hear us say: Lord, I do not mind about that. If I can only
   please Thee, it is enough'.
     __________________________________________________________________

Anointing Him Beforehand

   "Let her alone; why trouble ye her? She hath wrought a good work on me.
   For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do
   them good: but me ye have not always. She hath done what she could: she
   hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying" (Mark 14:6-8).

   In these verses the Lord Jesus introduces a time-factor with the word
   beforehand', and this is something of which we can have a new
   application today, for it is as important to us now as it was to her
   then. We all know that in the age to come we shall be called to a
   greater work--not to inactivity. "Well done, good and faithful servant:
   thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many
   things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" (Matthew 25:21; and
   compare Matthew 24:47 and Luke 19:17). Yes, there will be a greater
   work; for the work of God's house will go on, just as in the story the
   care of the poor went on. The poor would always be with them, but they
   could not always have Him. There was something, represented by this
   pouring out of the ointment, which Mary had to do beforehand or she
   would have no later opportunity. I believe that in that day we shall
   all love Him as we have never done now, but yet that it will be most
   blessed for those who have poured out their all upon the Lord today.
   When we see Him face to face I trust that we shall all break and pour
   out everything for Him. But today--what are we doing today?

   Several days after Mary broke the alabaster box and poured the ointment
   on Jesus' head, there were some women who went early in the morning to
   anoint the body of the Lord. Did they do it? Did they succeed in their
   purpose on that first day of the week? No, there was only one soul who
   succeeded in anointing the Lord, and it was Mary, who anointed Him
   before hand. The others never did it, for He had risen. Now I suggest
   that in just such a way the matter of time may be important to us also,
   and that the whole question for us is : What am I doing to the Lord
   today?

   Have our eyes been opened to see the preciousness of the One whom we
   are serving? Have we come to see that nothing less than the dearest,
   the costliest, the most precious, is fit for Him? Have we come to see
   that working for the poor, working for the benefit of the world,
   working for the souls of men and for the eternal good of the
   sinner--all these so necessary and valuable things--are right only if
   they are in their place? In themselves, as things apart, they are as
   nothing compared with work that is done to the Lord.

   The Lord has to open our eyes to His worth. If there is in the world
   some precious art treasure, and I pay the high price asked for it, be
   it one thousand, ten thousand, or even a million pounds, dare anyone
   say it is a waste? The idea of waste only comes into our Christianity
   when we underestimate the worth of our Lord. The whole question is: How
   precious is He to us now? If we do not think much of Him, then of
   course to give Him anything at all, however small, will seem to us a
   wicked waste. But when He is really precious to our soul, nothing will
   be too good, nothing too costly for Him; everything we have, our
   dearest, our most priceless treasure, we shall pour out upon Him, and
   we shall not count it a shame to have done so.

   Of Mary the Lord said: "She hath done what she could". What does that
   mean? It means that she had given up her all. She had kept nothing in
   reserve for a future day. She had lavished on Him all she had; and yet
   on the resurrection morning she had no reason to regret her
   extravagance. And the Lord will not be satisfied with anything less
   from us than that we too should have done what we could'. By this,
   remember, I do not mean the expenditure of our effort and energy in
   trying to do something for Him, for that is not the point here. What
   the Lord Jesus looks for in us is a life laid at His feet--and that in
   view of His death and burial and of a future day. His burial was
   already in view that day in the home in Bethany. Today it is His
   crowning that is in view--when He shall be acclaimed in glory as the
   Anointed One, the Christ of God. Yes, then we shall pour out our all
   upon Him! But it is a precious thing--indeed it is a far more precious
   thing to Him--that we should anoint Him now, not with any material oil
   but with something costly, something from our hearts.

   That which is merely external and superficial has no place here. It has
   already been dealt with by the Cross, and we have given our consent to
   God's judgment upon it and learnt to know in experience its cutting
   off. What God is demanding of us now is represented by that flask of
   alabaster: something mined from the depths, something turned and chased
   and wrought upon, something that, because it is so truly of the Lord,
   we cherish as Mary cherished that flask--and we would not, we dare not
   break it. It comes now from the heart, from the very depth of our
   being; and we come to the Lord with that, and we break it and pour it
   out and say: Lord, here it is. It is all Yours, because You are
   worthy!'--and the Lord has got what He desired. May He receive such an
   anointing from us today.

Fragrance

   "And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment" (John 12:3).
   By the breaking of that flask and the anointing of the Lord Jesus, the
   house was pervaded with the sweetest fragrance. Everyone could smell it
   and none could be unaware of it. What is the significance of this?

   Whenever you meet someone who has really suffered--someone who has gone
   through experiences with the Lord that have brought limitation, and
   who, instead of trying to break free in order to be used', has been
   willing to be imprisoned by Him and has thus learned to find
   satisfaction in the Lord and nowhere else--then immediately you become
   aware of something. Immediately your spiritual senses detect a sweet
   savour of Christ. Something has been crushed, something has been broken
   in that life, and so you smell the odor. The odor that filled the house
   that day in Bethany still fills the Church today; Mary's fragrance
   never passes. It needed but one stroke to break the flask for the Lord,
   but that breaking and the fragrance of that anointing abides.

   We are speaking here of what we are; not of what we do or what we
   preach. Perhaps you may have been asking the Lord for a long time that
   He will be pleased to use you in such a way as to impart impressions of
   Himself to others. That prayer is not exactly for the gift of preaching
   or teaching. It is rather that you might be able, in your touch with
   others, to impart God, the presence of God, the sense of God. Dear
   friends, you cannot produce such impressions of God upon others without
   the breaking of everything, even your most precious possessions, at the
   feet of the Lord Jesus.

   But if once that point is reached, you may or may not seem to be much
   used in an outward way, but God will begin to use you to create a
   hunger in others. People will scent Christ in you. The least saint in
   the Body will detect that. He will sense that here is one who has gone
   with the Lord, one who has suffered, one who has not moved freely,
   independently, but who has known what it is to let go everything to
   Him. That kind of life creates impressions, and impressions create
   hunger, and hunger provokes men to go on seeking until they are brought
   by Divine revelation into fullness of life in Christ.

   God does not set us here first of all to preach or to do work for Him.
   The first thing for which He sets us here is to create in others a
   hunger for Himself. That is, after all, what prepares the soil for the
   preaching.

   If you set a delicious cake in front of two men who have just had a
   heavy meal, what will be their reaction? They will talk about it,
   admire its appearance, discuss the recipe, argue about the cost--do
   everything in fact but eat it! But if they are truly hungry it will not
   be very long before that cake is gone. And so it is with the things of
   the Spirit. No true work will ever begin in a life without first of all
   a sense of need being created. But how can this be done? We cannot
   inject spiritual appetite by force into others; we cannot compel people
   to be hungry. Hunger has to be created, and it can be created in others
   only by those who carry with them the impressions of God.

   I always like to think of the words of that "great woman" of Shunem.
   Speaking of the prophet, whom she had observed but whom she did not
   know well, she said: "Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man
   of God, which passeth by us continually" (2 Kings 4:9). It was not what
   Elisha said or did that conveyed that impression, but what he was. By
   his merely passing by she could detect something; she could see. What
   are people sensing about us? We may leave many kinds of impressions: we
   may leave the impression that we are clever, that we are gifted, that
   we are this or that or the other. But no: the impression left by Elisha
   was an impression of God Himself.

   This matter of our impact upon others turns upon one thing, and that is
   the working of the Cross in us with regard to the pleasure of the heart
   of God. It demands that I seek His pleasure, that I seek to satisfy Him
   only, and that I do not mind how much it costs me to do so. The sister
   of whom I have spoken came once into a situation that was very
   difficult for her: I mean, it was costing her everything. I was with
   her at the time, and together we knelt down and prayed with wet eyes.
   Looking up she said: Lord, I am willing to break my heart in order that
   I may satisfy Thy heart!' To talk thus of heart-break might with many
   of us be merely romantic sentiment, but in the particular situation in
   which she was, it meant to her just that.

   There must be something--a willingness to yield, a breaking and a
   pouring out of everything to Him--which gives release to that fragrance
   of Christ and produces in other lives an awareness of need, drawing
   them out and on to know the Lord. This is what I feel to be the heart
   of everything. The Gospel has as its one object the producing in us
   sinners of a condition that will satisfy the heart of our God. In order
   that He may have that, we come to Him with all we have, all we are--
   yes, even the most cherished things in our spiritual experience--and we
   make known to Him: Lord, I am willing to let go all of this for You:
   not just for Your work, not for Your children, not for anything else,
   but for Yourself!'

   Oh, to be wasted! It is a blessed thing to be wasted for the Lord. So
   many who have been prominent in the Christian world know nothing of
   this. Many of us have been used to the full--have been used, I would
   say, too much--but we do not know what it means to be wasted on God. We
   like to be always on the go': the Lord would sometimes prefer to have
   us in prison. We think in terms of apostolic journeys: God dares to put
   his greatest ambassadors in chains.

   "But thanks be unto God, which always leadeth us in triumph in Christ,
   and maketh manifest through us the savour of his knowledge in every
   place" (2 Cor. 2:14).

   "And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment (John 12:3).

   The Lord grant us grace that we may learn how to please Him. When, like
   Paul, we make this our supreme aim (2 Cor. 5:9), the Gospel will have
   achieved its end.
