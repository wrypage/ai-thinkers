   Translator's Introduction

   In terms of his writings, Abraham Kuyper is probably best known for his
   tomes on academic, social, economic, political and theological topics.
   It is those writings that currently are bringing him into the
   international lime light since a group of Reformed scholars have
   organized translation projects of those books, while others have
   recently written about Kuyper's life and theories. Please see the
   Kuyperiana page on my website [5]www.SocialTheology.com for some of the
   details.

   Another genre of Kuyper's writings is also beginning to receive renewed
   attention in English, namely his volumes of meditations and writings on
   the Holy Spirit. For my own small part in this, please go to the last
   page of this book.

   Here I present to you my English translation of Kuyper's Op den
   Pinksterdag (met Hemelvaart), volume 3 of his series Dagen van Goede
   Boodschap (Kampen: Kok, 1923, though written in 1888). The literal
   translation of the title of this volume is On Pentecost Day (with
   Ascension), while the series title is Days of Good Tidings. I have
   chosen as title for this translation The Ascent of the Son--The Descent
   of the Spirit: 26 Meditations on Ascension and Pentecost. Someone
   described these as "meditations and biblical-theological articles,"
   being both at the same time. They originally were published in the two
   Kuyper newspapers, De Standaard and De Heraut.

   Kuyper explains that he treats Christ's Ascent or Ascension, the more
   common term, into Heaven along with the Descent of the Spirit within
   one set of covers, because these events are so closely related. In his
   own Introduction, he writes, "Thus the Ascension and Pentecost belong
   together in one single unity. He ascended into Heaven in order to pour
   out the Holy Spirit. It is because of that unity that this bundle
   offers you meditations on both of these aspects of salvation history
   together." Though the Church today tends to downplay or almost ignore
   the Ascension, Kuyper insists on its importance. You can't do without
   it and you can't afford to ignore it, for it is woven into your entire
   spiritual life, a point that he makes very clear throughout the eight
   meditations on the subject.

   The Birthday of the Catholic World Church

   He begins his introduction with a majestic declaration: "On Pentecost,
   the Church of God steps onto the world stage as the Universal Catholic
   world church." Majestic it is and probably fitting for the time when
   the majority of the population belonged to a church, but at the time of
   the event itself, people would have been surprised at such an opening,
   since the community of believers was a mere handful. It hardly looked
   like anything global. And could even the most ardent believer at the
   time envision a universal church?

   Nevertheless, I like the spirit of that opening. It's like a sudden
   wakeup call for the wimpish Western church of today, as if it had a
   pail of ice water dumped on it. Yes, that Church does deserve that kind
   of declaration, for it represents the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
   It is a fitting coming out on the world stage, even though it is not
   the forceful kind of language we are accustomed to in meditational
   literature. But, Kuyper is Kuyper--and that can only mean forceful
   language, meditational, theological or political.

   In spite of the importance of the event, it does not receive the
   attention today of either Easter or, even less, Christmas. Kuyper
   explains that this was

   not because Pentecost has less value or respect than do Christmas or
   Easter, but because it appeals to a level of imagination and conception
   too high for the average person and is too spiritual. Pentecost is the
   noblest of the three feasts, but only for those who have tasted the
   noblest. Only those who themselves have received the "first fruits of
   the Spirit" can truly celebrate this Feast of the Spirit!

   Pentecost "the noblest of the three!" Is it too high and too spiritual
   for the Church of today? Why is it celebrated with such a low profile?
   I encourage you readers to begin a "crusade" to restore the celebration
   of Pentecost--along with Ascension, since the two are inseparable--to
   its appropriate level as the birthday of the Church. I often greet
   people with "Happy birthday" on Pentecost morning and receive little
   more than a quizzical look. John Boer again?! This event, my sisters
   and brothers, needs to be revived and you and your friends can start
   it. You may wish to start with your pastor.

   Universalized Spiritual Autobiography

   I am far from an expert on Kuyper, though I have a general acquaintance
   with his major ideas. Neither am I an expert on his meditational
   writings. In fact, this volume is the only one I have read carefully. I
   do not know how it compares to his other volumes in this genre. But I
   have developed a strong feeling that these meditations reflect his own
   spiritual journey and makeup.

   As summarized below, Kuyper underwent a lengthy conversion experience
   during which he struggled intensely and during which his earlier strong
   theological affirmations toppled one after another. One of his
   biographers, Frank Vanden Berg wrote, "His inner spiritual struggle of
   those days was one of those intimate personal experiences that remain
   behind the veil. One does not publicize them...." I believe that these
   meditations represent much of his own personal spiritual struggles;
   that he did, in fact, write about them in these meditations. It was
   just not in an acknowledged biographical context.

   Furthermore, these personal experiences were mixed with and profoundly
   influenced by his theological instincts, which, in turn were changed by
   his spiritual experiences. This means, among other things, that many of
   the chapters contain heavy trinitarian theological stuff mixed with
   what he offers as universal Christian spiritual experiences, but which,
   I have a hunch, were, in fact, personal rather than universal. Though I
   deeply appreciate reading these profound reflections on his spiritual
   experiences, I cannot always identify with them. My experiences are
   different, probably a little more relaxed, from those of this intense
   man for whom everything seemed so absolute. I can point to experiences
   in my own life, but not to the antithetical type Kuyper experienced.

   Kuyper's spiritual struggles never ceased. They reflect the ups and
   downs of St. Paul, who would descend from the mountain top of praise
   and worship down to the cry that, of all men, he was the most
   miserable. Kuyper's forceful personality, his native quest for power,
   his proclivity towards pride, would continually trip him up and lead to
   moments of despair:

   "Would God forget His grace and never again bless with His mercy?" Was
   the experience of salvation only something momentary in order to let
   him sink into even deeper suffering? Was it a mere glimpse of a light
   beam that would make the dark fears in his heart even more real? And so
   the soul goes under, defeated.

   Oh, no, not so fast, not immediately. At first, when this situation
   develops, he doesn't know it and is not aware of missing anything. But
   once this forsaken state ends and the Lord revives his soul again,
   that's when the regrets and the pain return. And only when the
   Comforter returns, does he realize with unspeakable pain that the
   Comforter had left him.

   But such struggles, real as they are, would always end in victory:

   Even among those born again, the eye of the soul can at times close
   again either partly or fully so that it can no longer see the Spirit
   clearly, but in such cases the consoling face retains His presence; the
   Holy Spirit does not withdraw.

   Not for one moment should we entertain the thought that the struggle of
   King Jesus for the further development of His Kingdom is ever suspended
   for even a minute.

   This can only be spiritual autobiography--Kuyper's own struggles.
   Despite Vanden Berg, he lifted his own veil.

   He had an extended conversion experience during which his entire world,
   along with his worldview, turned upside down. His "No's" became
   "Yeses"; his denials, affirmations and vice versa.

   Somewhere along the line, the spiritual changes within him came to
   their culmination through the ministry of a peasant female parishioner
   of his by the name of Pietronella Baltus. This whole history is
   sketched for us in Vanden Berg's biography Abraham Kuyper. In these
   meditations every true Christian is portrayed as having experienced
   deep and profound struggles of fear and despair until they cross the
   spiritual threshold and come to rest in the arms of a compassionate
   Father, now glorifying in His love and peace.

   I would guess that most born-again people, an important reality in
   these meditations, go through some struggles before "delivery," but
   Kuyper's description of the process and experience is just over the
   top. It is mostly really intense people or people with a particularly
   dark past that, it is my hunch, experience the struggle as profoundly
   as Kuyper describes it. He was extremely intense and absolute; He had a
   strong love for power and needed to dominate; His egotism sometimes
   seemed almost boundless. It was only when he read a novel of two
   brothers in which all these characteristics of strength and power were
   pitted against those of love and self-sacrifice with the latter clearly
   ending up in victory, that the truth finally dawned on Kuyper: He had
   to give all that up.

   Author and title are Charlotte M. Yonge: The Heir of Redcliffe, a
   591-page English novel published in 1853 that plays out in both England
   and Italy. Though little known in and not even written with The
   Netherlands in mind, I wager that this book is one of the most
   important in Dutch history through its profound effect on Kuyper. It is
   not all that unusual a book, but it was just the kind of book he
   needed; it hit him between the eyes; reading it became a major factor
   in his final surrender. Because of its role in the life of Kuyper,
   Marian M. Schoolland's condensed version was published by Eerdmans of
   Grand Rapids in the book's centennial, 1953. Probably, Yonge was never
   made aware of the effect of her novel on Kuyper and, subsequently, on
   The Netherlands.

   In short, once the light of God has entered our souls, we begin to "see
   all of reality in a totally different perspective, both things on earth
   below and in Heaven above."

   Antithetical Thinking

   Antithetical, yes. Kuyper affirmed both common grace and antithesis,
   two seeming opposites, and kept them in balance. However, in this book
   on Ascension and Pentecost Kuyper is strongly antithetical. Perhaps
   this can be explained by the course of his conversion history. He moved
   over from his earlier self-described "starkest intellectual
   rationalism" that had pervaded theological scholarship in The
   Netherlands and led him to applause when his professor denied the
   resurrection of Christ. He went through an overpowering experience in
   response to a scene in Yonge's book, during which, in his own words, in
   one single moment, "I scorned what I formerly esteemed; I sought what I
   once dared to despise."

   Conversion or being born again may produce a new person, as especially
   St. Paul emphasizes, but the old is not altogether obliterated. When I
   was born again, my physical exterior was still recognizable to my
   family and many aspects of my personality remained in place, though,
   hopefully, over time in a renewed and refreshed way. The same with
   Kuyper. His forceful personality and way of expressing himself
   remained, but were now placed in the service of his Saviour. That, too,
   led to strong contrasting antithetical statements. From these
   meditations, one would get the impression that the entire world, that
   is, the community that does not know or acknowledge Christ, is
   literally one hell of a place without anything good to be said about
   it. That is not really the import of Kuyper's writings as a whole;
   there is plenty of common grace all around, but in these meditations it
   is all antithesis. For example, he writes,

   But now these two work against each other. On the one side there is the
   unregenerate (not born again) world that seeks its excitement in the
   visible and can therefore not understand the Spirit. On the other side,
   there is the flock of the Lord that, saturated with the streams of the
   Spirit, despises those unholy stimulants. Thus, from both sides there
   arise tension between them, stronger stimulation, more powerful pushes,
   but both from completely opposite sources.

   Strong Sense of Sin

   Along with this strong sense of antithesis is his strong sense of sin,
   even in the life of born-again Christians--especially, I believe, his
   own, his life of pride and power. "And should there be a time when the
   light in your soul's eye dims, when guilt, sin, unrighteousness, when
   all sorts of idolatries and images or a mountain of pride block your
   prayers...." "For those who live life at a deeper dimension, misery is
   when the load of a sinful life oppresses them, when their conscience is
   restless and when they are tormented by the question what will become
   of them in eternity."

   Despair and hope often replace each other in quick succession. In the
   mist of the struggle, "you can still sense in the dark of night those
   prayers of the ascended Saviour, that supreme Prayer Warrior above who
   pleads on your behalf." Jesus is not the only one routing for us. The
   Spirit also comes in to console "us with respect to our evil heart and
   our wicked nature as well as our powerlessness and our heart-rending
   lack of holiness."

   This is the fighting Kuyper, fighting against his own proclivities; in
   St. Paul's terms, the struggle between the old and the new man. It was
   a fierce struggle within him that never ceased, that would take him
   through dark nights of the soul and that would find its resolution only
   in repeated and renewed surrender to his Saviour his Advocate, pleading
   on his behalf, and the Spirit, who, at his darkest hour, would serve as
   his comforter, consoling him within. All this was so fierce and
   precarious that even "if that pleading prayer for you were ever to
   cease for even one moment, you would no longer share in His salvation."

   The Trinity

   Kuyper was a great one to hold forth at length on the mysteries of the
   Trinity. I have seldom read so much about the precise internal workings
   of the Trinity, unless it be Darrell W. Johnson's Experiencing the
   Trinity. Kuyper seemed to know exactly what each Person within the
   Godhead does or does not or even cannot do. Even within the Person of
   the God-Man Jesus Christ, Kuyper could decipher exactly what He can and
   cannot do as Man or as God. I believe Kuyper read a lot
   into--"eisogesis" as it is called in theology-- the Ecumenical and
   Reformed creeds and used his theological imagination to fill in some of
   the blanks. Parts of certain meditations can be read almost as
   Trinitarian manuals. Nevertheless, after he had pumped and squeezed all
   the alleged facts out of the Trinity that he required for his purposes,
   he always ends up in outbursts of praise and glorifies God in all His
   manifestations. After he seemingly had totally demystified some aspect
   of one of the members of the Trinity, he falls back into profound
   adoration of the mysterious Three-in-One. The mysterious remains after
   all.

   The following paragraph is typical and one of many:

   His glorification affected his human nature as well. Please understand
   this properly. It was not that His divinity began to share His divine
   attributes with His human nature. That would be impossible and even
   absurd. The personal union of both natures took place at the moment of
   incarnation, His birth, and this relationship has since that time
   become neither less nor more intimate, but remained unchanged. It was
   precisely that relationship that caused both natures to be united most
   intimately without confounding them. The divine remained divine and the
   human, human, without any carryover of attributes from the one to the
   other.

   Things get complicated. In Meditation 11, Kuyper strongly affirms three
   times in a row that the Son enjoys unity of substance with the Father
   and the Spirit, only to deny that same status of the human Jesus
   Christ. He may be in concert with orthodoxy in such theological
   constructions, but to berate people who don't have it all together as
   holding to an impossible position and even accusing them as "absurd,"
   then I can only shake my head. Let's be honest, by the standard of
   human logic and rationality, the entire doctrine of the Trinity is kind
   of impossible and absurd, even though we devoutly cling to it as
   revealed in the Scripture and further developed by pious Church
   Fathers. But for Father Abraham, after one of the most intricate of
   Trinitarian paragraphs, "it becomes absolutely clear"!

   I wonder whether or not Kuyper might have extracted too much from the
   trinitarian "data" in both Scripture and creed. But all this analysis
   and speculation may help those who long for greater clarity about the
   mystery of the Trinity. Above all, all of this is placed in the context
   of devout worship and adoration on the part of an intense child of God,
   who is given to analyzing and describing every aspect of his own
   spiritual struggles not only, but also of the Persons of the Trinity
   who effect his salvation. It is, perhaps, not for every person to dwell
   upon for too long, but for those who can wade their way through this
   Trinitarian stuff, it is meant to lead you into to the same mode of
   worship and adoration that it brought to Kuyper.

   Heavenly Geography?

   Heavenly geography seems like an archaic interest. However, in 2010,
   the German writer Dieter Wellershoff wrote a novel with the title Der
   Himmel ist kein Ort--Heaven Is not a Place--that caused a lot of
   commotion in Germany and led to several conferences even. At one of
   these conferences a rap band performed that wore T-shirts with the
   slogan "Heaven is not a place. It's a feeling." Obviously it remains a
   topic of interest, even if only in its denial.

   An intriguing question that keeps cropping up for me is whether Kuyper
   viewed Heaven as a physical place. If this essay were an exercise in
   scholarship, I should really do research on this subject in other
   Kuyper publications before discussing the question any further. This is
   not the time and place for that. However, in these meditations,
   everything in that region or sphere--not sure what words to use
   here--seems very physical and spatial. He writes of a Heaven that has
   its own structures and measurements, appearance, nature and essence as
   well as housekeeping arrangements and mode of existence sort of
   parallel to those of this world. Heaven is pictured as stretched out
   endlessly above our firmament. Describing our Lord's Ascension, Kuyper
   writes:

   To put it correctly, the Lord, our Saviour, departed from here in order
   to arrive there. He not only passed through the clouds and the
   atmosphere, but, when He arrived in Heaven, He did not tarry in the
   frontal regions, but He traveled on till He finally arrived in that
   region where the central point of God's full revelation is located, the
   very throne of God.

   In other meditations he writes in similar tone:

   Thus an actual transfer or displacement occurred from one place to
   another. He is hence no longer where He used to be, that is, on earth,
   but now finds Himself in another place different from where He was
   before. Thus, in that highest Heaven there is a place where Jesus lives
   and works in our flesh. It is a place somewhere in that highest realm,
   where all the angels wait for His commands and where those fallen
   asleep in the Lord have found Him. It is the place where our eye will
   also search Him out and where we, once having entered into His glory
   through, will see Him as He is.

   Or:

   Jesus ascended into Heaven, into that Heaven that, like the earth here
   below, was created and thus was not from eternity. It is, to be sure, a
   totally different creation sphere, but that nevertheless offers a realm
   of life and activity, of enjoyment and beauty, but in a much richer
   sense. It is not a vague entity, purely spiritual, but a rich and
   glorious reality. It is a world much more real than our world in which
   we currently live. It is a created place that has a foundation; our
   actual fatherland. It is that magnificent creation where all of God's
   good angels have their abode as well as those saved by the Lamb, the
   crowd that no one can count. This is the very goal of the existence of
   believers, their real home.

   Heaven seems almost empirical, that is, it has limits and it has
   borders where it touches upon the "lower creation" as he calls it. All
   of it so concrete, like physical, empirical geography that could almost
   be drawn on a map!?

   Son vs Father

   One thing Kuyper warns against is the tendency to overrate the role of
   our Saviour and have Him replace the Father, as if all things come from
   the Son. Sometimes people pray to Jesus for all kinds of favours and
   things, especially when they pray with children and try to make it
   sound as simple and personal as possible. Though this practice may seem
   innocent, Kuyper warns against it in strong terms--well, what else
   would you expect from "Father Abraham?" Writing about the phrase,
   "Above, where Christ is," a quotation from the New Testament and the
   title of Meditation 7, he comments,

   This is a treasure of a phrase that absolutely does not mean that all
   good no longer flows from the Fountain of all good, but out of Christ.
   This could make it appear as if we had replaced God with Christ, who
   now becomes the Fountain of all good. We may not entertain such a
   shocking idea for even one moment. The eternal and glorious God is and
   remains the Fountain of all good forever, for everyone and, thus, also
   for us.

   But it means that the Lord Jesus has already received or collected the
   waters from this Fountain on our behalf, that He has already gathered
   it for us and that they are already intended for us. And thus, as truly
   as our soul is united to the Lord Jesus Christ, so we can be sure we
   will never lack an abundance of refreshing waters. Yes, out of God
   eternal, but through the Mediator.

   Elsewhere he comes out in full force:

   So long as we wander along the slippery path of spiritual fanaticism
   and sickly imagination is it possible that we might exclusively hold
   fast to Christ and think it is all about Him, not about the divine
   Being Himself. Where this happens, faith soon loses its refreshing
   strength and the waters of life do not flow through the channel of our
   hearts. You must let go of this false Jesus image that you had formed
   in your sickly soul. Then, suddenly you will once again cleave to the
   real Immanuel, He who always points away from Himself to the Father!

   The practice of misguided piety thrown overboard.

   God vs Believer

   Another form of misguided piety Kuyper identifies for us is the false
   humility that leads us to deny any achievement of ourselves and ascribe
   it entirely to one or all of the members of the Trinity. Someone has
   been credited with an honour and then shrugs it away as if she
   accomplished nothing and it was all God's doing. Kuyper will have none
   of it and counters this false sentiment with the little-known and
   unmentioned doctrine of "Concurrence"--God working in us to do it
   ourselves. To deny our own part is to deny His. Even my language here
   fails, for it is not a matter of each doing his/her own part. God does
   it completely in us and we do it completely through His empowerment.
   Kuyper writes:

   For this purpose have I, your God the Holy Spirit, been sent in order
   to make all of this effective in you eternally and completely; so to
   work that you will drink in all the blessedness as if you were your
   work, even though it was I who did this in and through you.

   Not that He exacts it from our empty hearts, but, instead, He pours it
   into those empty hearts and somehow arranges it that we ended up doing
   it ourselves.

   And then came the prayer of the soul, prayer not for worldly treasures
   or prosperity, but for the fulfillment of that promise. To beseech God
   every morning and evening to receive that promise that He work in us to
   will and to complete and that we will walk in the works for which He
   prepared us. Oh, blessed joy when it would come and we might thank Him
   for His fulfilled promise.

   So, accept the praise of men for your well-deserved honour while also
   acknowledging Him who worked in you the will and ability to achieve.

   The Bottom Line

   After all is said and done, here we have this forceful, mighty, giant
   of a man, this "Father Abraham," shorn of all spiritual veils, a
   struggling child of God with deep spirituality, at the same time a
   mighty leader of the oppressed Christian peasants, to whom he totally
   unveiled himself spiritually. Here we have a pious man who passionately
   loved his Saviour and who felt totally devoted to the Spirit whose
   descent he celebrated in these meditations, a man who insisted on the
   need for and the reality of being born again, something he referred to
   so often:

   However, with genuine second births, the veil totally falls away so
   that so that the view of the Spirit hits and falls upon us. This
   amounts to His being poured out in us; His indwelling in His temple;
   His coming into us, living, praying, comforting and motivating.

   What puzzles me is how the members of the denomination he founded and
   into which I was born could be so spiritually morose. Not that they
   harboured no faith, but the vast majority of them could and cannot
   express their spirituality or even pray spontaneously in the contexts
   of their families, let alone in other contexts. Their leader let it all
   hang out; the people were and are dour in their expressions of the
   faith. You can still detect strong traces of that feature in the
   Kuyperian transplants to Canada and the United States. That is a puzzle
   and a pity. How much more beautiful an open display of faith, joy and
   peace as offered to us by our own "Father Abraham."

   And let me surprise you. If you think of altar calls as not fit in a
   Reformed setting, go to the closing of almost any meditation in this
   book and you will see the literary equivalent of altar calls. Yes, this
   Son of Thunder issued altar calls to wake you up and make you sensitive
   to the Spirit whom the Father sent via His Son. He wants you to
   jubilate together with all the angels. He invites you to enter into the
   joy of the Lord. Watch him struggle with you and, at the end, together
   with you see the doors to your heart open to let the Lord strong and
   mighty enter.

   There still is one more ancient door, that is, the door to your own
   heart, the door to your soul that satan bolted shut and sealed. Oh, how
   many thousands of times have you banged your head against that ancient
   door to your heart. It was too stuffy; in your anxious heart you could
   no longer stand it. You had to get out and you banged against that door
   and shouted, "Open up! Open up! Have mercy and don't let me suffocate
   in this stuffy place." It didn't help; No one heard you. That door to
   your heart turned out to be permanent as well.

   Until.... Until He came, He the King of glory! When He sent His Word
   from His majestic throne and hammered His envoys with it, it became
   clear to you that where the Word of the King is present, there is
   power. For at that moment the locks snapped and the bolts cracked; the
   doors opened, rose up and He entered, the Lord strong and mighty.
   Halleluiah!

   Kuyper's Literary Style

   Kuyper was/is known as an exuberant and tumultuous person with strong
   feelings and powerful emotions--Abraham de Geweldige or Abraham the
   Terrible, the Son of Thunder, the Violent, the Mighty--all of which can
   be found back in these meditations. Everything is expressed in forceful
   language and images that often go over the top and sometimes lead to
   exuberance and exaggeration.

   Ever since his university student days, Kuyper was recognized as having
   an acute sense of language and as a "master of style and diction." A
   more recent scholar describes him as an "able wordsmith." That he
   surely was. Words and phrases topple all over each other. They just
   gush out. He could seldom say anything concisely in one word or phrase,
   but had to constantly pile them on top of each other. Almost everything
   of significance needed to be said in triplicate or more.

   In the vocabulary department he would use series of different words and
   phrases that, when translated into English, often end up in the same
   words. A couple of classic word examples for those who know the
   language: "Ingekleefd, ingegroeid, ingelijfd en ingevlochten met de
   eigen levensvezelen...." I turned it into " Each child of God must be
   grafted into, grown into, annexed into and plaited with its own
   fiber...." Or take "stand en bestand en welstand." One of my friends in
   The Netherlands, a poet and writer in her own right, did not know what
   to make of it. The language was just too exotic for her! I did the best
   I could at this point. Probably not totally correct, but as close as I
   could get.

   He may have been a wordsmith, but I am not so sure about him as a
   "sentence-smith," at least not in this book. Not infrequently his
   sentences take up half a page. If you think sentences in Paul's letters
   in the New Testament are complicated, you have seen nothing yet! Of
   course, I realize that, like German, the Dutch sometimes allow long
   string-on sentences that are not tolerated in English. That probably
   was even more acceptable in Kuyper's days. But in this computer age,
   when you transliterate one of these long sentences, the entire screen
   ends up with nothing but long green disapprovals. A few times I managed
   to retain the unity of such sentences with the computer's approval. You
   have no idea how proud I was of those results of my "sentence-smithing"
   in English!

   In terms of duplication and more here is a good example:

   It is a thirst that cannot be quenched until everything that separates,
   prevents and beclouds drops away and will not be stilled until there is
   no more world to distract you, no more time to drain away, no more
   sinful heart to lead astray and no more devil lurking in the dark to
   lure you away from the One.

   Part of this was due, I believe, to the personality described above;
   part of it to his extensive vocabulary and imagination. One way of
   saying it just would not do it for him. But part of it was, I believe,
   also due to his hurried lifestyle. The man was engaged in such a
   variety of projects and programmes and had so many books and articles
   to write, lectures to prepare, that, at least for these meditations, he
   did not have the time to calmly reflect and hone his use of language.
   He just threw or scattered his vocabulary out there on the paper
   without bothering to edit. The publisher's editor must have thrown up
   his hands in despair at times and just let it go.

   For the most part, Kuyper seemed to just cobble sentences together
   without any serious attempt to express himself clearly. Subject,
   predicate and all other grammatical features become almost impossible
   to ferret out. At one time, early in Meditation 14, even after
   consulting one of my Dutch advisors, I simply threw up my hands in
   despair and inserted an ellipsis. He constantly switches back and forth
   between second to third person pronouns, between singulars and plurals,
   and at one time even refers to a mother lion as a "he." Sometimes
   totally arbitrary in terms of tenses and pronouns. Just throw it out
   there and move on. After all, he was a hero and icon for his people; he
   was ensured a faithful readership. You may thank me for having done the
   hard work of ferreting out most of these irregularities for you!

   Kuyper often quotes from either Scripture or creeds without indicating
   source or reference. Sometimes one can find the source by doing an
   Internet search, but if it is a quote from the Bible it can be almost
   impossible to find the exact reference. I have come to the conclusion
   that often his Bible quotations must have been his own translation, so
   that one can find no exact Dutch source. Furthermore, the Hebrew or
   Greek texts he used were based on manuscripts different from those on
   which the NIV is based. For this reason, you will occasionally find
   that the correlation between his Dutch quotations, often
   unacknowledged, and my English "translation"--"re-working" might be a
   better term-- can be fuzzy. A case in point is the reference to
   Jeremiah's prophecy of doom in general culminating in some version of
   Jeremiah 5:13 near the end of Meditation 13.

   This book is one of separate meditations; it does not contain a
   sustained argument from beginning to end. So, you must not expect
   progression from one chapter or meditation to the next. Each meditation
   stands on its own; there is no building up from beginning to end. There
   is considerable repetition from one meditation to another. In view of
   many unfamiliar ideas and emphases, by the time you have finished
   reading the entire book, your ideas about the mystery of the God-Man
   Jesus Christ and about intra-Trinitarian relationships will have had a
   chance to be challenged, filled in and matured, but in a hit-and-miss
   fashion, not in a sustained progression.

   Allow me to add a couple of comments about a couple of features I as
   translator have inserted into the mix. One is about capitalization. All
   synonyms, nouns and pronouns referring to God or a Member of the
   Trinity are capitalized in this book. This is partially because I hold
   that the honour and majesty of God require this token of respect and
   partially to help you, the reader, to distinguish between references to
   God or the Members and any creature, human or otherwise. It is a device
   that enables me to retain more of the original sentence structures
   without the confusion found there.

   I have also taken the reverse liberty. Except where grammar demands
   capitals as at the beginning of a sentence, all proper and other nouns
   as well as pronouns referring to satan or the devil are not capitalized
   for the parallel reason to the above: satan does not deserve the honour
   of capitals. However you picture him/her, she/he is the worst scumbag
   in history!

   Finally, to help you locate the beginning of each meditation in digital
   versions of this book, I have inserted an asterisk (*) behind each
   title.

   Translator's Final Comments

   In these final comments I want to begin with a word of praise and
   appreciation for Sabrina Tsai, a professional graphic designer, who
   generously gave of her time and talent to get this entire book in shape
   not only but also designed its meaningful and beautiful cover. Thank
   you, Sabrina. That's putting yourself in the service of the Kingdom of
   God that was so central to Abraham Kuyper's calling.

   Okay, time to let you do your own reading and meditating, but let me
   assure you there is much more that may surprise you and tug at both
   your heart and your emotions. And all of that from Abraham "de
   Geweldige," the Son of Thunder. Don't read too hurriedly. Allow
   yourself time to understand and sink in. The total number of
   meditations is 26. Should you wish to ponder them slowly, you could
   read one every two weeks, spend a year absorbing them and, with this
   deep focus on the Person and work of the Holy Spirit, deepen both your
   intellectual and spiritual life. Even Kuyper, after all his detailed
   analysis of Trinitarian affairs, workings and distinctions, when it
   comes to Pentecost, advises, "Ponder, but do not analyze too much."
   Father Abraham, that man of power and overstatement, put it gingerly
   and tenderly:

   When you fall on your knees, this gaze in faith carries you quick as
   lightning, within one heartbeat, from your prayer room to the Lord in
   Heaven. Then you are in the presence of your Jesus, in whom you
   recognize the Lamb that was slain, and you worship Him with a love that
   melts your soul.

   May these meditations bring you closer to your Saviour and lead you
   into the Father's everlasting, ever-inviting embrace. That is Kuyper's
   invitation to every reader, to all of you stoic Gereformeerden /
   Reformed-- to you! That's the bottom line for Father Abraham--the most
   unashamed and unabashed "Evangelical" of all Kuyperian writers!

   Introduction by Abraham Kuyper

   On Pentecost, the Church of God steps onto the world stage as the
   Catholic World Church.

   Originally, the Church was universal or catholic--the meaning is the
   same. It was so during early days of life in Eden and in the days of
   Noah , even during the time that Terah, the father of Father Abraham,
   wandered in the area Ur of the Chaldeans and Haran, that is the modern
   land of Iraq.

   However, since the call of Abraham, the universal Church was narrowed
   down to one people and nation and, eventually, enclosed within the
   national borders of Israel. From this point on, the church was no
   longer universal or catholic but became a volkskerk, a national church
   in the strictest sense of the word. She retained that status until the
   day of Pentecost, when she laid down the trappings of a national church
   and once again morphed back into the original universal Church,
   catholic in its higher Scriptural import.

   This development flowed out of Christ's Ascension into Heaven. From the
   Ascension on, the Head of the Church no longer has His seat in the
   earthly Jerusalem on Mount Zion, but in the Jerusalem that is above,
   from where He rules His Church for all peoples and nations alike. The
   Apostle Paul especially has abundant praise over this mystery in his
   touching epistles to the Churches of Ephesus and Rome.

   Thus the Ascension and Pentecost belong together in one single unity.
   He ascended into Heaven in order to pour out the Holy Spirit. It is
   because of that unity that this bundle offers you meditations on both
   of these aspects of salvation history together. These meditations first
   take you into the heavenly Jerusalem, into the Tabernacle made by God
   without human participation. From that point, they descend with you
   back to the Church on earth, but now together with the Comforter, that
   is the Holy Spirit.

   Meditation 1*

   Lift Them Up, You Ancient Doors!

   Lift up your heads, you gates;
   lift them up, you ancient doors,
   that the King of glory may come in.
   Who is He, this King of glory?
   The Lord Almighty--
   He is the King of glory.
   Psalm 24:9-10

   In the depth of his soul, King David had a hankering that he himself be
   allowed to build the temple for the Ark of God. But a prophet came with
   a message from God that it was not he but "one of your own sons... is
   the one who will build a house for Me," the son referring to David's
   successor King Solomon (I Chronicles 17:11-12; II Samuel 7:12-13). Once
   David was convinced, he did not complain or try to force the issue but
   surrendered his heart's deepest desire and comforted his spirit in what
   his son was to fulfill instead of he himself.

   Ah, what a blessed, glorious day it would be when the Ark of God would
   be ushered into the completed Temple! In Psalm 24, David was so taken
   up by that vision as if that day had already arrived for him! He
   envisioned it all as if it were really happening right in front of his
   eyes. Those magnificent pinnacles, those stately and dignified walls.
   And then the ascent of the Ark of God as it signified His majestic
   presence in the Holy of Holies. It was as if David looked beyond the
   Ark and the Temple, right into the heart of that Other David, for whom
   his ancestors had prayed so fervently and of whom both Ark and Temple
   were nothing but a shadow and symbol.

   David envisions the Ark of God ascending the slope of holy Mount Zion
   till the delegation runs dead into its fortress wall. That wall is
   punctuated by gateways, each of which has doors. For the ark to gain
   entry, it has to go through one of these doors, but they are too low,
   too diminutive, too stifling for Him, for whom the ascent of the Ark is
   a mere symbol of His real ascent into glory. But listen! Now in the
   Spirit, David sings a psalm summoning the gateway to arise, to open up,
   to raise its doorposts and broaden its entryway! Oh, ancient doors,
   expand, befit yourself for royalty, unlock yourself! For look, the King
   of Glory is about to enter, the Lord of the heavenly hosts, He who
   revives and delights my soul.

   Psalm 24 does thus certainly point directly to the narrow gateway in
   Zion's wall. Imagine the scene: Here's Jerusalem with the Temple high
   above it and between these two that fortress wall with its formidable
   gateway and its ancient doors. That's why, with the Ark as carrier of
   God's majesty approaching, David sings this psalm in holy ecstasy:

   Be lifted up, you ancient doors,
   Lift up your heads, you gates;
   that the King of glory may come in.
   ^Who is this King of glory?
   The Lord strong and mighty,
   the Lord mighty in battle.

   And then once more:

   Lift up your heads, you gates;
   lift them up, you ancient doors,
   that the King of glory may come in.
   Who is He, this King of glory?
   The Lord Almighty--
   He is the King of glory.

   However, all this, glorious as it is, is not the really essential
   thing, because the earthly Zion was not the essence of it. The earthly
   Jerusalem was only a shadow, as were the Temple and the Ark itself.
   Similarly, Zion's fortress wall that separated Jerusalem from the
   Temple was also a shadow. All of that was nothing but graphic teaching,
   a symbolic representation of the real, pointing and alluding to the
   future permanent, the real, the eternal.

   The "wise" do not understand all of this, but the Church of God and the
   beloved ones He has chosen do understand it. And that is the reason
   that throughout the ages the Church of God consciously, aggressively,
   and with determination declared loud and clear that David, while
   singing about the Ark in symbolic language, was actually referring to
   the actual Ascension of Jesus!

   In the earthly Jerusalem people thirst after the living God, but He
   lives high up on Mount Zion. There are that impenetrable wall and those
   ancient unforgiving doors. Always that separation! To see the Temple;
   to know the Ark is there; to know there, there is the presence of the
   Lord and then those impenetrable walls, those narrow gateways and those
   ancient doors! Ach!

   But, arise, oh, arise my soul; arise, oh, languishing Jerusalem! At the
   real Ascension, those barriers burst open. There flows forth salvation.
   There comes the King of glory! Now those impossible walls yield; those
   narrow gateways lift themselves up. Now, rise, rise you ancient doors
   for Him to enter, He the Lord of the heavenly powers and hosts, while
   you, who were thirsting after your God, sing and jubilate in victory!

   ================

   What then are those "ancient doors?" They represent everything that
   separates Jerusalem from the Ark. They are symbolic of everything that
   constitutes a wall between the languishing heart of the wretched and
   the holy glory of their God.

   A door invites you to enter, but it is bolted and prevents you from
   entering. It is an ancient door that prevents you from entering. No
   matter how hard you knock and kick, it remains impenetrable, so that
   you conclude that it will never open. They seem like eternal doors that
   will keep you outside forever!

   But now comes the Messiah. God has compassion for the wretched and
   sends you a Saviour. But what will happen? Will those doors, those
   ancient doors, also resist Him?

   It is precisely to this question that David prophecies in the Spirit.
   For Him, that Messiah, those ancient doors will fly open; they will
   open up wide and rise on high to allow Him, the King of Glory, to enter
   His Kingdom.

   Note well: time and again it is a door, a barrier. First, there is that
   ancient door of the flesh that holds you in bondage and won't allow you
   to enter, that flesh that suffocates you. But Christ bursts through all
   of this and comes to you in that flesh Himself through that ancient
   door of the flesh. And so He is near you already, one with you, become
   like your brother.

   But you have still not arrived. The Word, another name in the Bible for
   the Messiah, becomes flesh with you, but in such a way that the Messiah
   and you are both in a position of wretchedness, locked out of the
   heavenly Zion, banned from the desired glory with that wall and its
   ancient door still preventing you.

   Therefore, it is imperative that out of and with that flesh further
   steps be taken. Ascend that mountain, from the level earth to heaven on
   high. That's where the glory is, not here on earth. He is here in
   weakness, but once He has reached that place, He will become mighty,
   great in majesty and empowered to rescue you and bring you salvation.

   That is the reason for the Ascension.

   To Heaven! That is, to the place where weakness is glorified, where
   there is strength and power. That is where your flesh goes, your
   Messiah in your flesh, in the same flesh and blood that hung on the
   cross of disgrace on Golgotha.

   It is now finally that those ancient doors widen themselves and rise
   high. Now the King of glory enters in. Your King, oh Church of God, who
   alone has the wherewithal to bring you

   salvation, to justify and sanctify you for full salvation. Now,
   finally, by having entered those ancient doors into the better
   Tabernacle not made with hands, your King dispenses salvation and
   blessing. His power exudes from Him and satan slinks away, because the
   godless are being justified.

   =============

   But even now we have not yet reached the end of the road. There still
   is one more ancient door, that is, the door to your own heart, the door
   to your soul that satan bolted shut and sealed. Oh, how many thousands
   of times have you banged your head against that ancient door to your
   heart. It was too stuffy; in your anxious heart you could no longer
   stand it. You had to get out and you banged against that door and
   shouted, "Open up! Open up! Have mercy and don't let me suffocate in
   this stuffy place." It didn't help; No one heard you. That door to your
   heart turned out to be permanent as well.

   Until.... until He came, He the King of glory! When He sent His Word
   from His majestic throne..., it became clear to you that where the Word
   of the King is present, there is power. For at that moment the locks
   snapped and the bolts cracked; the doors opened, rose up and He
   entered, the Lord strong and mighty. Halleluiah!

   Meditation 2*

   You Ascended on High

   When You ascended on high,
   You took many captives;
   You received gifts from/for people,
   even from the rebellious--
   that You, Lord God,
   might dwell there.
   Psalm 68:18

   Whenever doubt rears its head, it often begins by casting into doubt
   the Lord's Ascension into Heaven. The Ascension with its precious
   comfort must first of all be deleted from one's spiritual eye. Once
   that has been accomplished, the cancer of doubt will unnoticeably gnaw
   deeper and deeper into the soul.

   For God's dear children the above is an incentive to focus their faith
   with all their energy especially on the Ascension of our Lord. It is
   not just a matter of intellectually accepting the Ascension, but they
   need to immerse their souls in this glorious fact and not allow the
   fountains of consolation that generally flow from it, be blocked.

   For the secular mind, the Ascension of Jesus is an insurmountable
   offence. How is it possible, the unbelieving pseudo-wisdom in us asks,
   that Jesus would bodily ascend on high, not just three or four meters,
   but into and beyond the highest clouds? How is it possible that Jesus
   bodily escaped our atmosphere, where there is no air to breathe and no
   warmth to keep that body alive? He would have died up there. How can it
   be, the rationalist skeptic in us asks further, that Jesus went way out
   into the universe, from where it takes thousands of years for the light
   of stars to reach us? And how could He in a mere ten days reach beyond
   those distant stars into Heaven, since ten days after the Ascension we
   celebrate Pentecost, the day He sent His Spirit? That's how that cancer
   of skepticism within us gnaws on and on. How can we with our human
   minds even comprehend the nature of the Heavens? How can Heaven contain
   physical bodies? And how could this physical body move through all
   these Heavens to the highest of all, where there is something like the
   right hand of the Father where Jesus took His place?

   Of course, measured by purely human understanding none of this would be
   possible; it is all the height of irrationality. For anyone caught up
   in this chain of reasoning Jesus could not have ascended into Heaven.
   But if you want to follow this line, you must realize that, according
   to the same secular reasoning, death spells the end of you with nothing
   beyond. You get buried in a hole like an animal and there you
   decompose. Finish! That's it.

   =================

   But to believe, to confess, to jubilate joyfully as a child of God,
   implies that we do not allow ourselves to be determined and walled in
   by the limits of our human understanding, for God has burst open those
   walls. Through the opening in that ancient wall a joyful light
   descended from above, through which we now see all of reality in a
   totally different perspective, both things on earth below and in Heaven
   above.

   In that light, we come to see that there is much more power beyond our
   power. In fact, our power is but a minimal part of the total available
   power in the universe. Far beyond and above our power and that of
   nature glitters the mighty majesty of God that breaks into this earthly
   life with a sovereign power that knows no bounds. With that sovereign
   power He bends and forces everything to obey His divine ordinances,
   everything, whether our bodies, the skies, mountains and clouds, the
   stars and the firmament, warmth and cold, distance and space, in fact
   all creation without exception.

   And then the Son of God comes to earth, that Son of God who has adopted
   our flesh and blood. He came but not to stay. The Lord God did not
   intend for Him to stay here, but, without shedding our flesh and blood,
   to ascend back into Heaven in order from that vantage point to protect
   God's Church and to comfort her. There is nothing to restrict His
   all-encompassing power to deal with His creatures as He wills, not even
   those factors that seem to make all this talk of Ascension unbelievable
   and impossible, whether space, distance, the teeming stars, the
   firmament or atmosphere, or even the law of gravity. All of these are
   but pseudo-obstacles over against the omnipotence with which He bends
   them.

   For these reasons, a child of God does not calculate those distances,
   speeds and possibilities. When it pleases God to assign a creature of
   His to exceptional tasks or to stretch them beyond their normal limits,
   there is nothing to prevent Him. Then all your normal data and
   statistics surrender themselves, while all your laboratory
   paraphernalia suddenly become useless and all you have left is to stare
   into this holy arena with your faith that empowers your penetrating
   gaze to see these spiritual verities.

   When you fall on your knees, this gaze in faith carries you quick as
   lightning, within one heartbeat, from your prayer room to the Lord in
   Heaven. Then you are in the presence of your Jesus, in Whom you
   recognize the Lamb that was slain, and you worship Him with a love that
   melts your soul.

   =============

   At that point all annoying objections disappear and human understanding
   has nothing further to contribute. Faith has rendered it speechless; it
   is now faith that speaks. Through

   this faith Jesus' ascension has become such an indubitable and certain
   fact, that you can see Him in His majesty, that you can as it were
   point Him out to others. You can see that for all these 2000 years He
   has from Heaven revived, saved and comforted His loved ones day and
   night.

   This is the miracle: While others see nothing fall from Heaven, those
   with the eye of faith see the manna of the soul come down, liberally
   spread out by Jesus over His Church. Just as Jesus at one time saw
   satan fall down from Heaven like lightning, while others saw nothing,
   so do those with an awakened soul see the soft rains of grace dripping
   down from day to day on the shriveled soul. They no longer have to ask
   whether Jesus has ascended into Heaven, for they experience every
   morning and evening that Jesus is in Heaven and from there blesses
   them.

   There will be moments when even a believer does not see it, but those
   are evil moments during which the veil of sin covers his eyes. However,
   as soon as that veil has been removed, see, Jesus is there again
   together with His angels, and grace once again pours down upon him.
   Does it really require proof that there is a sun in that sky, when I am
   enjoying its light and bask in it? Similarly, do you really expect me
   to prove Jesus' Ascension, when I feel His loving warmth stream over me
   and can taste that it comes from Him?

   =================

   It is when your soul is separated from Immanuel that it constantly
   blinds you to His Ascension. That happens when things go awry with you
   by moving out of Immanuel's orbit and you try to connect with God on
   your own by skirting Jesus. But when you know yourself to be
   incorporated with Him into one unity, a living member of His living
   Body through that mystical, wonderful living relationship in the
   Spirit, ah, then there is no distance, then your prayer rises up to Him
   constantly and His gifts descend on you every moment.

   Then that Jacob's ladder (Genesis 28:12) once again connects you, along
   which your soul rushes to meet Him, while His messengers of love rush
   down towards you. Everything is inspired, animated, full of salvific
   splendour and shimmering with godly life.

   There you have it: via Jesus' Ascension, both earth and Heaven become
   one in the deepest vision of your soul.

   ===================

   And should there be a time when the light in your soul's eye dims, when
   guilt, sin, unrighteousness and all sorts of idolatries and images or a
   mountain of pride block your prayers, then you can still sense in the
   dark of night those prayers of that supreme Prayer Warrior above, Who
   pleads on your behalf. He pleads first of all that the gift of prayer
   be restored to you.

   If that pleading prayer for you were to cease for even one moment, you
   would no longer share in His salvation. The pleading of your High
   Priest Jesus is the foundation on which your hope rests. It is on that
   basis that you entrust yourself when you lay down to sleep. When you
   rise in the morning, the pleading prayers of Jesus are once again the
   ground of your faith and trust so that you can face the struggle of the
   day before you with courage.

   Hence, you can't do without Jesus' Ascension. It is woven into your
   entire spiritual life.

   One day, and this remains the anticipation of your soul, you will be up
   there above with Him who waits for you!

   Meditation 3*

   Who Has Ascended into Heaven

   Therefore, since we have a great high priest
   who has ascended into heaven,
   Jesus the Son of God
   let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
   Hebrew 4:14

   Jesus has ascended into Heaven. It was not like us children of God, who
   die on earth only to wake up in Heaven immediately after our death. No,
   He rose from death already here on earth and from here ascended on
   high. His Ascension was such that He left us and our world and ascended
   alone to enter that Heaven that is stretched out endlessly above our
   firmament.

   To put it succinctly, the Lord, our Saviour, departed from here in
   order to arrive there. He not only passed through the clouds and the
   atmosphere, but, when He arrived in Heaven, He did not tarry in the
   frontal regions, but traveled on till He finally arrived in that region
   where the central focus of God's full revelation is located, the very
   throne of God.

   He did not ascend to Heaven or travel through those Heavens as a vague
   shadow or spirit, nor as a disembodied soul, but as a human being in
   His full humanity, in both soul and body. If you had been able to
   follow Him in your gaze as He ascended, you would also have been able
   to distinguish the different parts of His body and the expressions on
   His face. Even now, once you die and immediately enter Heaven with a
   glorified body, you will find there in the very centre of the highest
   Heaven your Jesus, your Surety, your Mediator. Oh, to be sure, you will
   see Him dressed in dazzling glory, but even so you will be able to
   distinguish His facial features like eyes and mouth.

   =================

   God did not create one world but two. That is, this world in which we
   live and that heavenly world where we are headed. Those two worlds are
   studies in contrast, with our world here below a vaguely lit cellar,
   and the Heavens above us a brilliantly lit "great room" where all
   jubilate and shout with joy.

   That world above us is a real world. True, the Lord God is omnipresent,
   but this earth is nothing but His footstool, while the throne on which
   He sits, governs and glitters in His divine glory, is not here but in
   the highest Heaven. When we approach an earthly ruler to speak to him,
   we do not focus our eyes on his feet but look up to him on his throne.
   Similarly, God's children do not seek their faithful and compassionate
   Father by focusing on His footstool, but they seek Him in Heaven, where
   He sits on His throne. That's the only place where you will find Him.

   It is not all that different among us. We have our ankles and our toes
   that give us great pain when someone kicks or steps on them.
   Nevertheless, when we meet we do not stare at each other's feet, but at
   our faces, through which the soul expresses itself. Again, true, God is
   omnipresent, but our eyes seek Him only in His glorified Place, where
   His divine face radiates above all His elect. Our God is in the highest
   of Heavens.

   And so our life's issues must be tried and solved not on earth but in
   Heaven above. Down here, appearances can deceive, but up there in the
   highest Heaven we face reality as it is.

   Oh, who will pass through those high Heavens before us and on our
   behalf in order to obtain for us pardon and our inheritance from the
   very throne of God? That is the question to which the Ascension of our
   Jesus provides the answer. He has done that. He is the one who ascended
   to that height. He passed through those heavens and arrived in the
   centre of God's glory that Scripture refers to as "the right hand of
   God." It is there in that court most holy that He advocates for us.

   You cannot reach those heavens by yourselves. Your sad complaint about
   who will ascend to heaven for us has no purpose, for not one single
   person or creature on earth can do that. But Jesus could and did
   precisely that. He ascended on your behalf and once He arrived there,
   He did not relinquish the earth, thinking, "Now that I'm back in
   Heaven, I'll just give up on that world that offered me nothing but a
   cross. From now on, I'm just going to enjoy myself in Heaven." No,
   Jesus remained that tender lover of and advocate for this terribly
   godless world and of his forgetful and ungrateful people.

   Thatis the meaning of Scripture: He entered into the highest Heavens as
   High Priest, not in order to forget about us, but to carry us in His
   heart; not in order to condemn us for our lack of love, but to pray for
   our salvation. Even up there in Heaven, Jesus is working on our behalf.
   His work as Mediator is not completed by a long shot. Yes, all
   necessary sacrifice has been fulfilled, but much more must still
   happen. He is now preparing a place for us!

   ==============

   The above great reality shifts the spiritual domicile of each child of
   God. In some nations, all residents are registered in their local
   government. For example, a father with small children plans to move
   from Siberia to Moscow. He goes ahead and prepares a place, while his
   family is still in Siberia. He finds a place and then registers his
   family with the authorities. Thus the children are already registered
   citizens of Moscow, even though they are still in Siberia. By law, the
   father's address is also the children's. That is their official
   domicile, their real home.

   So it is with God's children. At one time, Jesus was with them on
   earth--their Siberia--, but then He moved His domicile to a completely
   other location in the universe--their Moscow. He now lives above and
   because He lives there, that has also become the real home of His
   redeemed people. They are now registered together with Him. Even though
   they did not accompany Him originally, and stayed on earth, their
   citizenship is no longer here below, but in the city that has its
   foundation in Heaven.

   ================

   We do not finish our journey until our death. But as children who
   follow their father later but are already considered "living" in the
   new place, so are the thoughts of the redeemed focused on that new
   Jerusalem that awaits them.

   They question other pilgrims about it. They study the map of that
   country and the layout of the Holy City and all of its delights as they
   are revealed to them in the Scriptures. In the meantime, they value
   with great joy in their souls each blessing and gift that their
   Redeemer sends them as a foretaste and proof. And so they already now
   walk in the Heavens and already now enjoy the inheritance that is
   promised them.

   But let's be honest. That's how it should be and so it is in our
   momentary ideal faith visions, but not quite during our normal daily
   walk on earth--and that is precisely our sin: We look up to and
   anticipate Heaven, but still continue to regard the world and its
   treasures as the real thing.

   Oh, compassionate Christ, pull us up to You above through Your
   Ascension. Don't forsake Your redeemed!

   Meditation 4*

   Ascended Higher than All the Heavens

   He who descended is the very one
   Who ascended higher than all the heavens,
   n order to fill the whole universe.
   Ephesians 4:10

   Do you believe there is a Heaven? No, this is not about the heaven we
   refer to as "firmament," where clouds move about restlessly, nor about
   that high heaven or space with its twinkling stars. This is about that
   glorious Heaven, the Jerusalem with its pearly gates, where hosts of
   angels crowd around the throne of God. Do you believe in its existence,
   its reality?

   That spiritual Heaven was not always there, but it came into being, as
   Moses told it, when in the beginning God created Heaven and earth. Thus
   a created Heaven that has its own structures and measurements,
   appearance, nature and essence as well as housekeeping arrangements and
   mode of existence as does this world and has nothing in common with
   either the physical firmament that was created on day two nor with the
   starry sky that God called into being on day four.

   You really can't imagine what that Heaven looks like, even though it
   definitely has certain things in common with our world. This can be
   concluded from the fact that the bodies of the redeemed are at home in
   this heavenly household, though in gloried form. It can also be seen in
   the design of the Old Testament Tabernacle that God imaged to Moses on
   the mountain, in the ease with which the angels move about on earth and
   not the least in the images of earthly life with which the Holy
   Scriptures describe Heavenly life for us. But that's as far as the
   commonalities go. There are all kinds of things and relationships there
   that during our earthly pilgrimage we can at best vaguely imagine in
   our hearts, but never with a concrete impression of anything clear and
   vivid. These things and relationships include the activities and work
   done in Heaven, the way we move about, the shape of community, or even
   the nature of the relationship between the redeemed and the angels and
   both with Christ and through Him with the Triune God.

   We only know that we may never compare the life in that higher, sinless
   and thus more glorious creation to our life on earth. Existence on
   earth is better described as dull, lackluster, and muffled compared to
   that rich, dynamic and pulsating life whirling around the throne of
   God. Does the vision of a tree yielding its fruit monthly throughout
   the year give you an impression of a slumbering life in the shadows,
   lacking all dynamics? Does it not much more portray a glorious life, of
   an internal, pulsating energy many times the dynamism of our earthly
   style of life?

   That Heaven is local, that is, it has its limits in the form of borders
   where the lower creation ends and this Heavenly creation begins. As the
   dead cross the border from the one to the other, they experience a
   moment during which everything tells them, "I am no longer on earth; I
   am now immersed in a totally different creation. Now I am in Heaven."
   Although we do not speculate about distances that we do not understand,
   we may and even must decide and confess that Heaven is a created
   household with its own borders.

   From the above it is easily perceived that God does not live in Heaven
   in the sense that He lives there, but not elsewhere outside of it.
   Twice we read in the Bible, "The heavens, even the highest heavens,
   cannot contain you" (I Kings 8:27; II Chronicles 6:18). God is
   everywhere, omnipresent. That is to say, God is infinite so that it is
   impossible to posit even a single spot either within or outside of His
   creation where He is not always and fully present as God Almighty. Even
   the place of perdition has no borders that would keep out the
   omnipresent God.

   That is not to say that the Lord God reveals Himself in all places in
   equal manner or measure. God is indeed present everywhere, in Abraham
   the Father of all believers as well as in the donkey on which he rode.
   Nevertheless, what a difference in revelation! Even amongst people. For
   example, there is such a difference between God's presence in the man
   on the right of the crucified Christ and the one on His left.

   Likewise, there is a clear difference between God's revelation in a
   barren cliff or mountain cave and His revelation in the firmament that
   declares His glory or in a flowerbed with the aroma of His splendour.
   Keeping in mind these differences, it should not be difficult to
   realize that, regardless of His omnipotence, His revelation here on
   earth is totally different from that in Heaven.

   Though His revelation appears here only in an opaque way, in Heaven the
   Lord our God reveals Himself with heavenly clarity. When we want to
   speak to our neighbour, though knowing that he exists with his entire
   body, including his feet, we look him in the eye, because the soul
   expresses itself most clearly through the eye. Similarly, the soul that
   seeks God, instinctively looks towards Heaven, because, in a manner of
   speaking, it is there that the all-seeing eye of the Eternal opens
   itself and the redeemed there for the first time gaze upon His complete
   Being through that eye.

   ===============

   It is to that Heaven that our Security and Mediator ascended alive on
   that day. He had already been in Heaven. Better put, while He wandered
   around on earth, as Son of God He never left Heaven. He was God;
   co-eternal and co-extensive with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Hence,
   the revelation of His Godhead was the clearest and most glorious in
   Heaven.

   There in those Heavens is God's throne. That is to say that God, though
   omnipresent, there in the place of His clearest self-revelation, is in
   closest touch with the angels that carry out His will and thus that
   throne is the centre of His glory and power for all creation. It was
   from that centre of glory and power that the Son descended into this
   lower earthly creation and entered in our state of misery and bitter
   humiliation. Throughout it all, He remained God, but, out of godly
   compassion, the Mediator veiled His divine splendour and hid behind the
   somber form of human nature, sunk as it was in weakness and bitter
   self-humiliation.

   The process of suffering and humiliation did not stop there. Once He
   had entered that phase, He did not develop and promote Himself by
   ascending from glory to glory. To the contrary, His glory was veiled
   through voluntary self-sacrifice until at last He fell into the deepest
   shame and drowned in the depth of death.

   And then what happened? Did the Son of God give up on His human nature
   when He reached the depth of shame? Did He put an end to His
   humiliation by returning to His former self? In no way, brothers and
   sisters! When Jesus died, the eternal Son retained His human nature
   even in death, even as His body and soul separated while He underwent
   the violence of death. And then, when He finally reached the turning
   point from where, out of the depth of humiliation, He would begin the
   road to His exaltation, He did not begin this phase by throwing off His
   human nature, but rather by a renewed and higher animation of that
   nature via His resurrection.

   But even this was not enough. His humiliation passed through a slow
   process that began with the Son of God adopting the form of a servant
   and then went on to embrace suffering and death, finally to descend
   into the grave until this Man of Sorrows, in the midst of His
   suffering, drank from the cup of hell. Similarly, there was also a slow
   process of glorification, a continuous ascent from the lower to the
   higher, beginning with His coming out of the grave by His resurrection,
   followed by His triumphal Ascension from this earth, achieving royal
   power by taking His seat at the right hand of God, and, finally, the
   explosion of His glorification over all creation by His return to
   judge.

   His humiliation and glorification thus stand in strong contrast to each
   other. It was not a case of a gradual positive development that began
   in the manger and progressed through His resurrection to an ever higher
   place of honour. Quite the opposite, for until His resurrection, it was
   a process of continuous emptying of Himself, of decline, of the melting
   away and shrinking of His honour until He finally reached the deepest
   humiliation conceivable. At that point, not through Himself, but
   through an immense display of the majesty of the Triune God, He was
   ushered into the state of glorification and from here on to climb to
   higher levels of glorification step by step, just as during His phase
   of humiliation He steadily descended step by step.

   ===============

   The Mediator's glorification involved His full person, that is, His
   divine as well as human nature. It was definitely not restricted to His
   human nature. But that could bring up a question about whether it is
   possible to add any glory to that already consummate and complete
   divine nature, to make Him even more glorious. That, of course, is
   impossible and unthinkable.

   Take gold, for example. Goldsmiths enhance the shine of gold not by
   adding more gold to it, but by removing all the stain and tarnish that
   dampen its full lustre. So also was the glory of Jesus' divine nature
   enhanced, not that anything new was added to it, but His veiled and
   inherent divinity got the opportunity to radiate once again His full
   glory undisturbed and undiminished.

   Before His glorification, during the entire period of His humiliation,
   His divine majesty was hidden behind a veil that prevented the outward
   radiance of His glow. But now the opposite was happening: The veil took
   on a transparency that allowed His glorious majesty to radiate outward.
   That's how the divinity of the Mediator came to shine in a brighter
   glow.

   His glorification affected his human nature as well. Please understand
   this properly. It was not that His divinity began to share his divine
   attributes with His human nature. That would be impossible and even
   absurd. The personal union of both natures took place at the moment of
   incarnation, His birth, and this relationship has since that time
   become neither less nor more intimate, but remained unchanged. It was
   precisely that relationship that caused both natures to be united most
   intimately without confounding them. The divine remained divine and the
   human, human, without any carryover of attributes from the one to the
   other.

   In other words, the elevation of His human nature was not a matter of
   importing or adding elements that were foreign to it, but only of that
   which was exclusively human and fit human nature. It was not the
   shedding of His servant stature so much as that of the servant-like
   posture of His humanity. In His Ascension our Security received the
   fullest excellence of the spiritual and wonderful in body and soul in
   the most perfect form to which human nature is susceptible in its
   highest elevation. Nothing more, but also nothing less.

   That is His victory, namely, to shed everything weak, miserable and
   vulnerable that He had adopted in His human nature for our sake, and to
   become filled with all that is strong, glorious and rich that was given
   Him for the purpose of His eternal reign. As everyone's castaway, He
   had made Himself appear worthless, but see how He now turns all His
   enemies into a footstool before His throne.

   ===============

   He was elevated as a reward for all the works He performed. It was for
   perfectly fulfilling the law as well as for completing his function as
   Mediator. As the prophet Isaiah put it, "Though the Lord makes His life
   an offering for sin, He will see His offspring and prolong His days,
   and the will of the Lord will prosper in His hand" (Isaiah 53:10). It
   was also a reward for the incalculable value of His suffering by which
   He earned eternal glory for God's elect.

   His Ascension thus had to advance His mediatorial role as well. He
   descended into the depth of His humiliation, not for Himself but for
   us, laden with our guilt. Similarly, He had to climb out of his
   humiliation, not just for Himself but for us. Thus crowned with a glory
   that reflected not only Him personally, He was richly laden with the
   gifts of glory reserved for all of God's elect.

   When Jesus arose, all His followers arose in Him. When He ascended, all
   God's elect ascended in Him. They now sit with Christ in Heaven at the
   right hand of God. As the Psalmist put it, "When You ascended on
   high..., You received gifts from people, even gifts for people that
   they might dwell there with You" (Psalm 68:18). [1]

   ==============

   For this reason, the Mediator could not tarry on earth. The state of
   being glorified requires also circumstances that reflect that state. A
   released prisoner must not only exchange the chains of captivity with a
   robe of freedom, but he must also be released from his prison. Thus it
   was that, after being glorified, Jesus simply could no longer stay on
   this inglorious earth. The state of inner glorification required
   outward glorification as well. And so He

   ascended from a specific place through the air, the clouds and
   firmament, to that other world, that other household, that higher
   creation we call "Heaven." Once arrived there, He proceeded through the
   Heavens and ascended to the highest level, to that place in the
   universe where the Lord's revelation shows up in its clearest and
   purest form and is therefore the location of His throne. That is where
   He took on His glory, accepted His kingly status, and, sitting at the
   right hand of the Father, began to exercise His glorious power.

   Thus an actual transfer or displacement occurred from one place to
   another. He is hence no longer where He used to be, that is, on earth,
   but now finds Himself in a place different from where He was before.
   Thus, in that highest Heaven there is a place where Jesus lives and
   works in our flesh. It is a place somewhere in that highest realm,
   where all the angels wait for His commands and where those fallen
   asleep in the Lord have found Him. It is the place where our eye will
   also search Him out and where we, once having entered into His glory
   through grace, will see Him as He is.

   So, He is presently absent from the earth, but only, at the end of all
   things, to once again leave that place of glory in order to reveal
   Himself as the Judge of all nations.

   ==============

   In the meantime, He is the Guardian of every soul, the Governor of
   nations, the King of His Church and the Comforter for the weak of
   heart. For you see, though He is indeed bound to that place in the
   highest Heaven, with His grace, majesty, divinity and spirit He is
   omnipresent. He knows exactly all that happens on the whole earth as
   well as the thoughts of our hearts. With the arms of His eternal
   compassion He covers our souls and satisfies the hunger of our souls
   with His precious and delightful presence. He is familiar with the
   suffering of every heart, the sin in each family, the fights in each
   church and the decisions made for or against His glory in each church
   gathering.

   That's why he had to ascend to Heaven, so that He, though located in
   the highest Heaven, can be near to all of us and hear every voice of
   His beloved. What's more, our Mediator had to ascend into Heaven not
   only to send us His gifts, but also to prepare the House for His Bride,
   the Church.

   According to the Bible, Jesus said: "My Father's house has many rooms;
   if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to
   prepare a place for you?" (John 14:2). Again, "Jesus said to them, My
   Father is always at His work to this very day, and I too am working'"
   (John 5:17). His cry from the cross, "It is finished!" (John 19:30)
   finds its initial fulfillment in the declaration, "It has taken place"
   from John's Revelation.

   Meditation 5*

   Ascend to Where He Was Before

   Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?
   Then what if you see the Son of Man
   ascend to where He was before!
   John 6:61-62

   When we consider the Ascension of our King, there are a number of
   things we need to keep in mind: Heaven, the place to which He withdraws
   Himself; the Ascension itself, the act of the Ascension and the fact of
   His rising upward. We must not exclusively focus on Jesus' being in
   Heaven, but, as it is called and always was, a commemoration of Jesus'
   Ascension. That should preferably be done according to the way to which
   our Lord Himself pointed, namely, as a contrast to His earlier descent
   from Heaven and now a re-ascension or return to the sphere of glory
   where He was before.

   You may remember that touching statement of Jesus to the people of
   Capernaum who must have found it hard to comprehend when they heard, "I
   am the living bread that came down from heaven" (John 6:51). That is
   when the Lord said to them, "Does this offend you? Then what if you see
   the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!"

   Thus, the kernel truth on which we have to focus is that initial
   descent from Heaven and then, later, the re-ascension into Heaven. It
   is only against the background of the descent that we can see the
   Ascension in its proper light.

   ==============

   Perhaps you wonder about the significance of all this, about which
   deeper thought may be hidden behind it all. Let me illustrate. Someone
   jumps into a river to rescue a drowning person, but, unfortunately, he
   ends up joining the victim and both drown. So it was with our Mediator,
   a totally different being, who jumped into the river of our
   unrighteousness and misery to grab us and embrace us. It was a totally
   different entity that had the power to surface from this stream of
   misery, with the rescued victim in His arm, with His Bride in His
   heart, and holding those He purchased close to His breast. His descent
   was a demonstration of supreme love; His ascent, a demonstration of
   supreme power.

   Just think of all the humiliation He had to suffer. To abdicate
   voluntarily from the throne of glory, to descend to this earth into a
   young woman's womb, to become a poor person in this miserable world,
   then to allow Himself to be slandered, despised and, finally, to die a
   bitter death associated with contempt and slander. Now that requires
   deep pity and compassion. Here the passion for saving shines bright
   along with self-sacrifice and love for sinners. Here is whether you
   witness the triumph of the divine push for the utmost of grace.

   But with the Ascension it is totally different. Everyone with a sense
   of love, pity, self-sacrifice and compassion can jump into the stream
   to rescue a drowning child, whether you are a young fellow, a crippled
   old man or the mother, but who can actually rescue the child? Only He,
   who can come out of the water on his own strength.

   That ability to come out of the water does not depend on love or
   compassion, but only on strength and power, on strong control of water
   and wind with sturdy arms. But where do you ever find those two, an
   abundance of love and of power, together? Here on earth they usually
   act in opposition to each other. Is the strong muscle man not usually
   challenged in the area of love and pity? As to him who is tender and
   loving, does it not seem that everything turns against him, as if all
   his strength has melted away and going under is his sure but pitiful
   fate? Is the term "suffering servant of God" not a beautiful and worthy
   name for every servant of God who has lost out in the battle between
   love and power? Do not most who dare to challenge the powers of this
   world lose out? Oh, to gain a crown with God, ah, yes, definitely! But
   it is usually at the price of succumbing in the struggle. [1]

   =============

   Such a struggle may seem beautiful, tragic or touching to the tearing
   eye, but in spite of that, it does not help any. The Lord God does not
   play tragedy. With Him dying is never a game. Even displaying His most
   majestic and moral greatness, as long as it is mere display, is totally
   below the dignity of His divine majesty. No, the Lord God rescues; He
   truly saves both soul and body.

   And really, the undoing of saving love, no matter how tragic or
   touching, is never truly beautiful. The only truly beautiful, genuine
   and holy saving love is that which also triumphs. It is that love which
   not only jumps into the river but is also able to come out of it
   together with the victim, rescuing him from the river of misery and
   placing him where He Himself was before His earthly birth. That is the
   reason, my dear readers, that the Ascension of Jesus is so beautiful
   and majestic, so utterly glorious. For you see, this is that
   overflowing power. Here is that perfect triumph. Here, through majestic
   and amazing struggle, we see Him come up from the depth of human
   misery, climb up again, ascend again until He finally reaches "where He
   was before."

   But it was against every force and power we know. It all went against
   the laws of nature, including the laws of the human nature He had
   adopted. It was even against the overflowing love in the heart of His
   followers! Everything wanted to hold Him down and prevent Him from
   ascending. And yet, nothing could resist Him. He was victorious over
   all and everything. He ascended!

   And, oh, the wonder of His divine omnipotence! In His ascent He takes
   the entire Church of the redeemed with him into the Heavens, including
   those already living there, those now alive here on earth and those yet
   unborn--all of God's children.

   Look! There He stands in Heaven with the redeemed treasure of souls in
   His arms. That causes all the angels to worship Him. That drives all
   the martyrs and prophets to kneel before Him. That's why the Father
   crowns Him!

   Meditation 6*

   With Gifts for the Consolation of His People

   When you ascended on high,
   you took many captives;
   you received gifts for the people,
   even for the rebellious--
   that they might dwell there. [1]
   Psalm 68:18

   In order to understand any powerful demonstration of might and
   industry, one must go to the centre of the place where these forces
   emerge. A ruler cannot rule his country from a remote, isolated
   village, but must live and operate out of his official residence, spend
   time in the council chambers with his councilors and, surrounded by his
   henchmen, make his pronouncement in a way that inspires the soul of his
   people. Similarly, for a ship to arrive safely at its destination, it
   is not sufficient that there be a captain aboard. He must stand at his
   official command centre, where all crew members can hear his commands
   and from where he governs his whole marine empire. When an enemy
   invades your country and your army marches towards your national
   borders to defend your country, the commanding general does not shut
   himself up in some remote stronghold, but meets his army, calls his
   generals into his tent and from there manages the movements of his
   troops. These examples hold for every development of power and
   authority. To set the entire entity in motion, one has to be at the
   centre where the dynamic and movement originates.

   Thus, when someone wants to imagine the Ascension of the Lord Jesus
   Christ in a practical way and with serious spiritual thought, he has
   only to ask where the centre of the spiritual world order is located.
   Is the earth governed out of Heaven or, the reverse, is Heaven governed
   from the earth? Or could it be that both run on their own steam?

   The answer of faith is, of course, Heaven and earth are both governed
   by the wisdom of Providence. The throne of this regiment is in Heaven
   and everything that is and moves on earth is governed out of Heaven.
   The throne of God is not on earth but there above in the Heavens. It is
   there that all the spiritual threads holding life together unite. It is
   from above, not from the earth, that the word goes out that determines
   the flow of events. The seat of the regiment that governs developments
   in both Heaven and on earth is nowhere here below but exclusively in
   the chambers of eternal lights, the residence of glory.

   ==============

   If the above is all clear to you and you are convinced, then a second
   question arises: Was that regiment handed over to Jesus or not? The
   question will not tolerate a double answer. All power in Heaven and on
   earth was handed over to Him (Matthew 28:19). He was given a Name above
   all names in order that every knee shall bow in His Name (Philippians
   2:9-10). The Lord God has said, "I have installed my king on Zion"
   (Psalm 2:5). The Father has handed all things over to the Son. And thus
   "He must reign until he has put all His enemies under His feet" (I
   Corinthians 15:25). The reign is therefore His. It has been handed over
   to Him by the Father. He was anointed for this purpose. It was His due
   because of the reward promised Him for His soul-stretching labour. He,
   our Mediator, was King and had to also be revealed publicly as King.
   The title itself was not enough; it could not remain with the promise;
   it had to come to the point of actual practice of this mighty rule.
   Heaven and earth were waiting for Him to ascend to the throne; they
   were biding His royal word and were eagerly looking for the display of
   His glory.

   This was then the reason that the Mediator had to ascend to Heaven. He
   could not remain on earth, for the throne of glory was the only place
   in the entire universe where He belonged as the King appointed by God
   Himself. Since the Kingdom was His and the throne of that Kingdom is in
   Heaven, He could not remain far removed from that throne but had to
   speed His way to it.

   Thus the Lord's Ascension is nothing but His accepting His rule, an
   entry into the Kingdom, an ascension to His royal palace, an elevation
   to the residence of His majesty and glory. Regardless of His power,
   Jesus could not rule the world out of Jerusalem and could not reign the
   Heavens from the earth. The cords and lines of this divine regimen were
   above, not down here below. Hence it was imperative that He ascend from
   us, not in order to forsake and impoverish us, but to come closer to us
   and enrich us gloriously. As long as He was on earth, He could comfort
   only a few. It was only from the Heavens that all could be blessed by
   Him.

   =============

   This Ascension of our Lord was not a case of furtively stealing into
   the Heavens through the narrow door of death. Rather, it was an
   ascension into the chambers of eternal lights with great splendour.
   This was not the kind of splendour that would blind the eye of the
   world, for even in nearby Jerusalem no one noticed anything. Even the
   Roman emperor noticed nothing. Along the shores of the famous Tigris
   and Euphrates Rivers life continued its normal flow as if the reign
   over this world were still in the hands of an earthly ruler.

   However, for His Church the Ascension took place with stately and
   solemn splendour. At the time, that Church was represented on the Mount
   of Olives by His holy Apostles, who had seen and witnessed the entry of
   the King of Glory into His formidable palace. He was taken up while
   they looked on. Death did not separate them. He took leave from them
   fully alive. Immediately afterwards, the angels appeared in order to
   console the disciples. "Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand
   here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, Who has been taken from you
   into Heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen Him go into
   heaven" (Acts 1:11). At that point a cloud of lights gently slid in
   between them and He disappeared. But less than ten days later they saw
   Him in a different light. Now He ruled and by power of this divine rule
   He sent them the Holy Spirit.

   The Apostles have told of the splendour with which He ascended to their
   disciples and the Church has listened to this solemn story with quiet
   reverence. It has been recorded in God's Holy Word. Since then, year
   after year the faithful gather to commemorate this glorious scene and
   to remember how impressively solemn it was to witness Jesus ascend
   before their very eyes. That's when the Church contemplates Jesus
   deeply again. Then she again sees Him ascend the throne of His Kingdom.
   Then she once again lives and celebrates His royal regime.

   ================

   The full story of His splendour has still not been told; there is more
   to it. In addition to the Apostles, the splendour of that Ascent into
   Heaven was also a moment of holy joy for the residents of Heaven. For
   centuries the Holy Spirit has sung of it:

   Lift up, oh portals, now your heads;
   Arise, eternal doors, arise.
   Welcome your King.
   Who is this King, so great in power?
   He's head of the heavenly hosts.
   With songs of praise we worship Him.

   Up there above, there was also a joyful anticipation. The Heavens are
   concerned about the earth. The angels are eager to witness the
   mysteries of redemption. They greeted the Mediator in Ephrata's fields
   when He descended from Heaven. They served Him in the desert after
   satan's evil temptations. They supported Him in Gethsemane, when He
   almost collapsed. They pushed the stone away from His grave for Him to
   walk out. And now, at His Ascension, they come to meet and welcome Him.
   They descended so far that those on the front line could talk to the
   Apostles. They received the Saviour as it were from the Apostles to
   take Him to Heaven. That's where He came from and that's where He had
   to return. Everything there was prepared for that return. They all
   awaited the revelation of His glory, but it would not be till He
   accepted His reign in Heaven that the fulfillment of the promise would
   be realized along with that of their joyful anticipation and their most
   glorious hope.

   His kingship was retroactive in that He also became King over Abraham,
   Isaac and Jacob, the three patriarchs, over Kings David and Solomon, as
   well as all witnesses to God, the great martyrs of the faith and all
   prophets and seers. True, it was not the illustrious day when the
   elements will melt and all flesh stand before Him as judge, but it was
   nevertheless an illustrious day as a blessed introduction to it. So,
   when He entered Heaven, the voices of the heavenly choir echoed
   throughout all the heavens.

   =============

   Jesus ascended in the flesh as a human being. Of course, He remained
   the only and natural Son of God, in the words of the ancient Nicene
   Creed, of "one substance with the Father," one with Him. But He could
   not ascend in His divine nature, for in that mode He was omnipresent,
   that is to say, present everywhere. In that capacity He could not move
   from place to place and thus could not ascend back into Heaven, because
   He was there all along.

   But as a human being, yes, He ascended in our flesh and blood, the same
   that He had adopted in Mary's womb. That was in the same form in which
   Mary recognized Him and in which His Apostles had seen him ascend (Mark
   16:19; Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9-11). Again, in the same form in which he
   appeared to Paul on the way to Damascus (Acts 9:3-6), to John on the
   island of Patmos (Acts 1:9-11), and wherein Stephen saw Him when he was
   martyred (Acts 7:55-56) and wherein all flesh shall one day see him at
   His return on the clouds.

   And that's where the miracle comes in.

   In Paradise the Lord said, "Sovereignty belongs to mankind; to mankind
   authority over Eden." Alas, through his fall into sin, mankind lost his
   glorious position. His power languished; his strength shrunk. He who
   was destined to rule, became a slave, while his crown lay trodden in
   the mire of ambition and self-promotion.

   And then what happened? Another flesh-and-blood human appeared, the
   second Adam. This new human being suddenly receives back the reign that
   was lost in Eden. As a reward for the labour of His soul, He receives a
   complete reign, not just over Eden and the animals in the field, but a
   royal rule over earth and Heaven, including all the angels. Even the
   devils are no longer able to resist His will.

   =============

   And now the question is: Who is the beneficiary of this royal regime of
   the man Jesus Christ? The answer: The human race. The Heavens were
   already prepared and the angels did not need to be sanctified. As far
   as those who had already inherited salvation goes, they immediately
   passed through the final decision of that youngest of days. The
   judgment over the devils is also already determined.

   But all this had to tarry for the benefit of the human race. The reason
   that the Kingdom could not yet be handed over to God the Father but
   still had to remain in Jesus' hands for many centuries, is only and
   simply that the human race not miss out on Heaven. Jesus said, "I go
   away to do a mighty work: I am going there to prepare a place for you'"
   (John 14:2). That did not mean, of course, that there was a specific
   room that had to be readied or that this held only for the Apostles.
   Jesus meant to say that the goal of His royal reign in Heaven is not
   the angels but finding the place for those elect of God already in
   Heaven. Once the place for the last of the elect is ready, then His
   rule will come to its end according to the Father's will.

   =============

   Thus you can sum up the central goal of the Lord's Ascension in the one
   mighty profound word, "comfort." He ascended with "gifts for people,
   even for the rebellious, that they might dwell there" as Psalm 68:15
   puts it. [1] This did not mean that from Heaven He would keep an eye on
   whether there might be some sorrowing soul somewhere on earth, to whom
   He would then immediately fire off some comfort. To be sure, the
   Mediator does do that when the situation calls for it. He is rich in
   every form of comfort that might be needed. However, this is far from
   exhausting all that is included in the "gifts for human consolation."

   There is a much deeper meaning in the words of Ps. 68:15--"Gifts...
   that they might dwell there" that is, dwell there with Him. In other
   words, the comfort or consolation refers to the entire great ministry
   of drawing, preparing and enticing with which Immanuel, through His
   divine rule, directs from Heaven. The goal is that human after human
   gets lifted up from the filthy mud of our sinful life and transplanted
   in the forecourts of our God in order to bloom there as an oak of
   righteousness.

   Comfort counters sorrow. The deepest and richest comfort is that which
   is able to take away the greatest and deepest sorrow. That deepest of
   all our sorrows is not found in any specific pain or loss, grief or
   disappointment, but resides in the pitiful loss of our total person and
   soul to eternal death. Hence, the primary full comfort coming from your
   King above is that He rescues your soul from death, that He hauls your
   person out of the depth of destruction and that He, by means of His
   kingly reign, rescues you and pulls you to Himself in Heaven in order
   for you to jubilate together with all the angels of God. Without that,
   you, as a child of perdition, would have perished.

   Meditation 7*

   Above, Where Christ Is

   Since, then, you have been raised with Christ,
   set your hearts on things above,
   where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
   Colossians 3:1

   The Lord God is the overflowing Fountain of all that is good! Whoever
   confesses this, is serious in this confession and lives accordingly,
   has spiritually arrived.

   Of all that is good. Nothing flows or emanates from God to you except
   those good things, against which you may not complain but for which you
   must thank Him. If you cannot thank Him or you think to detect
   something evil, the source for that lies not in Him but in you and you
   alone. You are suffering from an illusion, if you do not recognize the
   truly good in what He sends.

   He is the Fountain of all good. There is no good that does not flow
   from Him. Everything within you or your child that does not emanate
   from Him, is not good, is wrong and sinful, even though it may have the
   appearance of being good. Conversely, if there is something truly good
   within you or your loved one, that is not the result of your or your
   child's efforts. It did not emanate from either you or your child, but
   flowed out to you from that Fountain of all good. There is not a
   speckle there to support a false self-image or to feed your
   self-justification. We are created in Christ Jesus for good works that
   God Himself has prepared in order for us to walk in, and for which we
   are to thank Him. The Scripture says, "For we are God's handiwork,
   created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance
   for us to do" (Ephesians 2:10). Therefore, when you do a good work,
   there is no room for the evil boast of the flesh, "That's what I did,"
   but only for the clean thought of the Spirit, "That's what God the Lord
   wanted to happen through my work."

   All good comes from a Fountain, a Spring. In other words, you do not
   draw the good out of the Lord God; you do not press Him for the good
   with your own strength and exertion. As water in a fountain flows
   towards you by the force within the fountain itself, without any
   exertion on your part, so, too, does all the good from the Lord your
   God come to you by itself, without any exertion from you. You do not
   draw it out of Him, but He sends it to you through the force of His
   self-sufficient love.

   And finally, the Lord your God is the richly overflowing Fountain of
   all these goods. Faith can never expect too much. No matter how much
   you have already received, there is always more ready to well up. It is
   never exhausted; one outflow crowds out the other. Even if you have
   been saturated the good things, that super overflowing Fountain still
   continues to well up.

   Therefore I repeat that whoever seriously claims that the Lord God is
   the overflowing Fountain of all his good things and lives accordingly,
   he has reached the goal. That is to say he is free from that inner
   cancerous weed of self-sufficiency and has become pure, rich and free
   as a relaxed and tender child of his God. He has been reshaped by God
   Himself.

   But what are these "goods" that flow out of this Fountain to God's
   beloved children? In short, they include everything that glorifies Him
   and that purges your soul. It is not the bread you eat or the abundance
   of your choice fruit. Well, yes, it includes all that. Why not,
   provided it is not only that. It does not even always include those. If
   your money or possessions, your food or fruit ever draw you away from
   the Lord God, then these are not the good. Where that is the case,
   starving from hunger were better for you, especially if that hunger
   leads you back to God.

   Understand well. The good that wells up from this Fountain is a good
   for your whole person, both body and soul. It is not a transient or
   temporary good, not something for which you grope around in the
   darkness; it is an enduring and inner good. It can even happen that
   your soul is struggling with temptation, but for which you subsequently
   will be thankful. What seemed at first evil, later turned out to be
   good for you.

   Once again, whatever wells up from this Fountain separates you from
   death and brings life. Out of that Fountain flows grace and that one
   rich grace takes on various forms of satisfaction and justice, of
   reconciliation and holiness, and forgiveness for the countless times
   you have forfeited the grace of God. Out of that Fountain flow every
   warning in your conscience, every self-accusation after committing sin,
   every tear of true remorse and each genuine childlike display of
   penance. Out of it flow all refreshing love, all lifting up out of the
   desperation of the soul, and every comforting recovery from anxiety and
   a fearful heart. There is still more. Out of it flow every word of
   warning, every call of admonishment, but also all urgings and
   invitations to love, all that keeps you from sin and draws you back to
   your God.

   Every germ, opening and inner dynamic of faith comes to you from that
   Fountain. Every movement of the Holy Spirit, every turnover of your
   inner life, in fact, everything that contributed to your becoming a
   child of God originated there. To put it even stronger, never, no never
   has there been even the slightest spark of pure genuine love that did
   not come from Him. Never has a robe of humility look so good on you
   that was not from Him. If there ever was anything in you, however
   small, that shone or radiated love and attracted honour and praise from
   God, it was only through Him, the Father of lights, that these good
   gifts were designated for and came to fruition in you.

   ===============

   Thus you've been shown the way. When you struggle to become cleaner,
   holier, more tender and warmer in sacred love, do not dig around in the
   dry bottom of your own heart, for that is not the source of these
   waters, but look up to Heaven. If those are the "goods" that you
   genuinely seek, well, then you no longer seek things that are on earth,
   but things that are above. But then be sure you seek them there and
   know the only Source from which they can flow your way.

   The Holy Spirit calls on you to "Set your hearts on things above, where
   Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things
   above, not on earthly things" (Colossians 3:1-2). That means that you
   need to be enticed and attracted not by the false tinsel and the
   deceptive enjoyments of the world, but that your soul needs to reach
   out to the glory of the heavenly Jerusalem.

   But there is still more to it. "Setting your heart on things above"
   also means that you will not thirst after gold or pleasure or public
   prestige, but that you pine after doing good works, after love,
   holiness, that sound lovely, not in human ears so much, as in God's.
   You need to thirst and be eager to bear the cross, have a clear
   conscience and stand upright and tremble before the Word of God.

   None of these things are found on earth; they are in Heaven. Love is
   born in Heaven, not on earth. Everything that is clean, holy,
   self-denying and pleasing to God, does not grow in the garden of your
   heart, but comes down from above; it is sent to you. When the peace of
   God finally completely fills you, it comes as a precious gift that
   originally welled up from the Fountain of all good and from there
   flowed down to you.

   ==============

   The entire truth is so deep and wide that there are still more
   treasures to be explored. We have yet to consider the title of this
   meditation, "Above, where Christ is." This is a gem of a phrase that
   absolutely does not mean that all good no longer flows from the
   Fountain of all good, but out of Christ. This could make it appear as
   if we had replaced God with Christ, who now becomes the Fountain of all
   good. We may not entertain such a shocking idea for even one moment.
   The eternal and glorious God is and remains the Fountain of all good
   forever, for everyone and, thus, also for us.

   But it means that the Lord Jesus has already received or collected the
   waters from this Fountain on our behalf, that He has already gathered
   them for us and that they are already intended for us. And thus, as
   truly as our soul is united to the Lord Jesus Christ, so we can be sure
   we will never lack an abundance of refreshing waters. Yes, out of God
   eternal, but through the Mediator.

   Do you want the capacity to love? It is there waiting for you in
   Christ, flowing through Him to you out of the Fountain of all good. Do
   you want a tender conscience, a humble soul, self-denial on behalf of
   others? Seek all these things above, where Christ is, for in Him they
   are available there for you, not just as general gems, but as a
   customized treasure designed specially for you; not just any signet
   ring, but one that has been customized to fit the circumference of your
   finger with your name engraved!

   A robe of righteousness, made to fit exactly for you!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Meditation 8*

   With the Lord Forever

   And so we will be with the Lord forever.
   Therefore encourage one another with these words.
   I Thessalonians 4:17-18

   It has pleased God to offer all His children a gravitational point for
   their soul, a central point for their desires, a focus for the love in
   their human heart for that single one beloved Immanuel. It was not as
   if God in all His eternal glorious Being would ***lose something of
   Himself, be reduced in some way, what with all the tension, effort and
   all the power of the love that could fall in their human heart. The
   Lord of Lords continues to encourage all that always and eternally. He,
   the Fountain of all good and the deepest well of all blessings, wants
   to be all in all. Never does He give one single droplet of love to the
   egoistic heart of His creature without keeping track of the direction
   this love takes. The fragrance of all love must be for Him who created
   all things only for Himself; all things, thus also the savour of the
   love of the human heart.

   We should never have doubts about the above. The longing in our heart
   for Immanuel, both in Scripture and with God's children, refer to
   nothing else but that glorious statement of Jesus Himself during the
   night of His death, when He said, "Whoever sees me, sees the Father!"
   (John 14:9). We are to be one with Him, Immanuel, at soul level, but
   only in order to gain access to and be conducted into the presence of
   the Father.

   So long as we wander along the slippery path of sickly imagination it
   is possible that we might exclusively hold fast to Christ and think it
   is all about Him, not about the divine Being Himself. Where this
   happens, faith soon loses its refreshing strength and the waters of
   life no longer flow through the channel of our hearts. We must let go
   of this false Jesus image that we had formed in your sickly soul. Then,
   suddenly we will once again cleave to the real Immanuel, He who always
   points away from Himself to the Father!

   That soul is pious that focuses on seeking the eternal Being. True
   piety consists of seeking God, to realize you cannot do without Him.
   The image of a deer that, exhausted by the hunt, cannot go further but
   yearns for the streams of water, has always been the God-given image
   for the child of God (Psalm 42).

   ===============

   But why is it that your soul's attraction to Jesus is so different from
   its attraction to God, not more, not stronger, but different? Let's
   take your beloved young daughter once again as an example. You can talk
   to her about the Eternal One and when she prays, she prays to God
   Himself alright, that most holy Being, Who fills her with solemn
   respect. Nevertheless, when you speak to her of God, her heart does not
   fully open, is not completely receptive. She would like to be open; she
   is inclined towards it, but she is incapable. The Lord God is too high,
   too distant, too glorious. She will try to imagine Him to her utmost,
   but to imagine God in Himself is beyond her. When she tries, all
   connection with God recedes into the distance like a High God as in
   some other religions.

   But now speak to her about Jesus and immediately her reaction changes.
   The Name of Jesus evokes a totally different picture for her. His Name
   seems more affectionate and speaks more to her heart. She can imagine
   that Name so much easier. Ah, Jesus, Him she can picture. Not exactly
   as He is, of course, not in sharp outline, but she can imagine Jesus
   entering her bedroom, sit down at her bedside, place His tender hand on
   her forehead and whisper, "My dear child, good night." With this
   imaginative scene in her soul, your daughter can fall asleep in peace.

   What's happening here? What is the mystery behind all this? In order to
   think about God, the child has to imagine something, but she is
   incapable of that. But in Jesus, God now provides her with her own kind
   of image. Now she no longer needs to feverishly search in her
   imagination; now she finds a resting place. She may not comprehend the
   process and is not able to explain it, but that is nevertheless the key
   to this wonderful mystery: your child can only think about God by
   looking onto and thinking about Jesus. It happens unconsciously. But as
   soon as she is in relationship with Jesus, the blessed experience of
   being in communion with God envelopes her heart.

   Please do not think, "That may happen to my daughter, but not to me."
   You would be wide off the mark. To be sure, you are different from her.
   You notice more. You are more conscious of your inner experience, but
   when it comes right down to it, in your soul you experience exactly the
   same thing your child does. Apart from Jesus, you can only conjecture
   God from afar. But when you come near Jesus and spend time with the
   Immanuel, then the eternal love of the Lord of Lords unlocks for you as
   well.

   ==============

   It is not Jesus' divine nature that causes this within you, but His
   human nature. Think about it. Let's say you meet a righteous and holy
   person, so perfectly pious and holy that from day one no one ever
   detected a single sinful odour on him. Imagine further that this
   perfectly holy person has the power to quell the sense of guilt in your
   soul and to salve your restless conscience with the balm of
   reconciliation, so that his inexhaustible holiness does not depress you
   but lifts you up. If that person could lead you into the presence of
   the Lord of Lords, he would be like Jesus.

   Not a single word emanates or a single look radiates from Him without
   your experiencing holiness or tenderness. From there, He leads you to
   the Eternal, where a mysterious power overcomes you that you don't
   understand but that nevertheless helps you experience something
   absolutely glorious as you approach God.

   This is not a matter of competition, of choosing between the one or the
   other or of going back and forth between the two. It is not a matter of
   the soul wavering between the two. It is rather an intense focus on
   Jesus that grows holier and penetrates deeper. And to the degree that
   you penetrate deeper into His soul, the glory of the Lord unlocks
   itself more for you.

   ==============

   Oh, that you would only seek your Jesus. Seek Him in His Word,; seek
   Him in your prayers, in the quiet meditations of your heart. The closer
   you are to Him, the nearer you will feel yourself closer to the Eternal
   One. To be united with Jesus is to be united with God.

   However, when you divorce yourself from Jesus, the Eternal and Glorious
   God simultaneously disappears from the horizon of your soul as well.
   Sin does that to you. It feeds upon your spiritual lethargy and upon
   the unrighteousness in your evil heart. That's when, while far removed
   from Christ, your soul also finds itself also far from God, turned away
   from Him and lost in loneliness. When the soul then finds itself pushed
   around by storms, it calls and screams desperately for comfort and
   consolation.

   It is so glorious to know that there will come a time when this will no
   longer happen. There will come a time, an eternity in fact, when
   nothing can again separate us from Christ. Then we will always be with
   the Lord and through Him worship that Eternal God whom we call "Abba,
   our loving Father." Therein lays the comfort for all God's children!

   Meditation 9*

   No One Is Near To Restore My Spirit

   This is why I weep
   and my eyes overflow with tears.
   No one is near to comfort me,
   no one to restore my spirit.
   My children are destitute
   because the enemy has prevailed.
   Lamentations 1:16

   The godly person calls out, "'This is why I weep! My eyes overflow with
   tears,' because the Comforter, who was to refresh my soul, is far from
   me."

   Do you ever weep like that? Oh, so many tears flow day after day and
   often into the night. Our heart desires, hopes for and hangs onto so
   many things. When these don't come or are taken away from us, an
   abrasive sense of fear and emptiness, of lack and disappointment goes
   through our soul. Sadness sometimes overwhelms both our heart and eye.
   We may experience a release when we weep and our heart can unburden
   itself by way of a tearful eye. Tearless, dry eyes only double the
   pain.

   A child weeps more readily, because it is more emotional. That is
   precisely the reason a child tends to be happier, for as the tears well
   up in its eyes and trickle down its cheeks, its childish sadness also
   dribbles out of its young heart.

   In contrast, we grownups keep our pain inside of us. It digs and bores
   its way deep into our hearts. It searches for release, not through the
   eye but via the depth of our soul. That is just what makes our pain and
   sadness that much more real, the reason being that shedding tears makes
   people sympathize, but if you cannot weep and receive no such sympathy,
   the pain bottles up without comfort or consolation.

   ==============

   But when at times you do weep, what do your tears call for? The Lord
   says also to you, "Why should the living complain when punished for
   their sins?" (Lamentations 3:39). Do you know that pain? Do your sins
   devastate you? Are you dying in your inner life because of yours sins?
   Do they oppress and wring your heart? Do you understand the Psalmist's
   terrified cry, "Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have
   destroyed me?" (Psalm 88:16). Alas, that cry leads us to take a
   penetrating look at each other. It altogether looks like it is too much
   for us, as if an alien pain has crept into our soul.

   Guilt? We acknowledge it. Sin? We confess it! Which person can claim
   clean hands? But away with that blindfold. Speak the truth and tell us
   whether or not you should not be accusing yourself nearly all the time?
   Not just after a specific act of disobedience or a specific sin, but
   all the time in general, in ordinary life. And when the hour came when
   you pined away in your inner life and your soul sank away in deep
   desperation, how did you overcome all that, except through the gracious
   operation of the Holy Spirit?

   Ah, if only that Spirit taught you, gripped you and made you thoroughly
   dissatisfied with yourself! If only He would make you aware of your own
   heart and of your own motives, of your past, your family, your birth
   all the way back to Adam. Then, yes, then your soul would overflow and
   begin crying for mercy and forgiveness from your God. But outside of
   that discovery and that introductory grace, you are so hard, so dull,
   so insensitive that your heart can jump and dance and skip while your
   soul is dying and laugh at your own stupidity rather than weep and
   mourn over your inner depravity.

   ============

   But you know, the weeping of which the man of God speaks in his
   exclamation in the text at the heading of this chapter, "This is why I
   weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no
   one to restore my spirit" is more than simply bursting out in tears for
   the realization of our status of complete damnation. He who airs such
   complaints has received refreshment. Light has broken into the darkness
   of his innermost. He has seen, tasted and reveled in Heavenly things.
   Oil has been dripped into his wounds; the boils have been pressed out;
   he has been given medicine; his has become the consolation of his God.

   Alas, suddenly the Comforter withdrew; the boil in his heart became
   infected again and the hope that he had cast on the Lord his God faded
   away. Now he is worse off than before and much unhappier. For he has
   known grace and mercy, but now it all has escaped him. He tasted
   consolation and refreshment of the soul, but now the soul is once again
   enveloped in its suffering.

   "Would God forget His grace and never again bless with His mercy?" Was
   the experience of salvation only something momentary in order to let
   him sink into even deeper suffering? Was it a mere glimpse of a light
   beam that would render the dark fears in his heart even more real? And
   so the soul goes under, defeated.

   Oh, no, not so fast, not immediately. At first, when this situation
   develops, he doesn't know it and is not aware of missing anything. But
   once this forsaken state ends and the Lord revives his soul again,
   that's when the regrets and the pain return. And only when the
   Comforter returns, does he realize with unspeakable pain that the
   Comforter had left him (temporarily).

   ==============

   You see, this Comforter had consoled him with glorious promises, for he
   could not carry all this by himself. The Comforter did not instruct him
   as human comforters tend to do by urging him, "You've got to do it! You
   must double your efforts!" No, the divine Comforter whispered into his
   ear, "Poor struggler, no, you can't do this on your own. With Me, there
   is counsel and strength. Come to Me and I will enable you to will and
   to perfect it all in you!"

   Now that was manna (Exodus 16:31) for the soul and water for the
   thirsty (Psalm 42). What a precious promise. Not that He exacts it from
   our empty hearts, but, instead, He pours it into those empty hearts and
   somehow arranges that we end up doing it ourselves.

   The law was no longer the executioner who hammered us to the cross, but
   a delineation of the glorious paths along which He would make us
   travel. And then came the prayer of the soul, prayer not for worldly
   treasures or prosperity, but for the fulfillment of that promise. To
   beseech God every morning and evening to receive that promise that He
   work in us to will and to complete and that we will walk the walk for
   which He prepared us. Oh, blessed joy when it comes. We yearn to thank
   Him for His fulfilled promise.

   ===============

   That was a Comforter, the Holy Spirit, that consoled us with respect to
   our evil heart, our wicked nature as well as our powerlessness and our
   heart-rending lack of holiness.

   But we became accustomed even to all that grace and mercy. God was so
   extremely generous. As a result, we lost our hunger and thirst and
   along with it the desire to pray earnestly and seriously. We no longer
   begged morning and evening for grace and mercy. We prayed more
   mechanical prayers without passion or concern. That's the reason the
   Lord put grace on ransom. He did not forsake you, but put you in
   skimpier meadows and gave you to drink from a creek that was almost
   dried up. The promise no longer poured mercy; at best, a few drops here
   and there.

   That's how the Lord drew the dullness from your soul. That's how you
   began once again to hunger and thirst. And then the weeping started all
   over again, because there was "no one ... near to comfort me, no one to
   restore my spirit." But when the sorrow becomes that intense, the
   Comforter Himself returns, for He was not far away: It only looked that
   way to eyes dimmed by sin.

   Meditation 10*

   The Other Comforter

   And I will ask the father,
   and He will give you another advocate
   to help you and be with you forever.
   John 14:16

   Among all the Christian celebrations there is none of which the average
   Christian understands so little, feels so little emotion and enjoys so
   little as Pentecost, the high feast of the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit. It is all so spiritual and offers so little to the imagination.

   In contrast, at Christmas there is so much movement and so many things
   to talk about with your children: the manger, that Child, the shepherds
   and their lambs, the angel choir, the murder of the children by King
   Herod's men, the temple visit, the flight to Egypt and so much more.

   Similarly, on Easter you can imagine the weeping women on their way to
   the tomb, the lonely wandering Mary Magdalene, the descent of the
   angels, the rolling stone from the grave, the two men walking the road
   of Emmaus, that evening meeting and then Thomas with his finger in
   Jesus' wounds.

   All of the above is concrete and subject to everyone's imagination.
   There's stuff for conversation. These stories can be sketched or
   painted. There is movement and variety; there's a wealth of human
   actors. Because everything is concrete to the eye, it all lives in the
   congregation's consciousness.

   But how different it all is with Pentecost. There's little more there
   than an upper room with people in and outside. Then there are
   miraculous sounds and mysterious bright lights. What is said confuses
   people outside and sounds foreign to those inside. It all ends up with
   a sermon to God's glory.

   Naturally, such a dull scene cannot possibly inflame your imagination.
   It does not conjure up any surprising images in your imagination; your
   children cannot enter this kind of world; it does not offer any stuff
   for a brilliant sermon. Every picture, every drawing, every painting of
   Pentecost ever produced falls flat. [1]

   I must quickly add that they had to fall flat, not because Pentecost
   has less value than do Christmas or Easter, but because it appeals to a
   level of imagination and conception too high for the average person and
   is too spiritual. Pentecost is the noblest of the three feasts, but
   only for those who have tasted the noblest. Only those who themselves
   have received the "first fruits of the Spirit" can truly celebrate this
   Feast of the Spirit!

   ===============

   Jesus calls the Spirit that He will send from the Father "another
   Comforter" or "another Counselor" (John 14:16-17, 26). This implies
   that the Son considers Himself also a Comforter or Counselor, but one
   who came only for a short time and would then leave again. That's why
   He would now send them another Comforter/Counselor who would be
   different from Himself in that this other one would not leave again but
   stay with them forever into eternity. Thus it should never be said that
   the Holy Spirit came only to compensate the disciples for the loss of
   their Jesus. Jesus neither meant nor said anything like that. To
   denigrate the Holy Spirit in such an unworthy way to the position of a
   temporary replacement for Jesus is to cut the Pentecost contribution to
   salvation off at its roots and to deprive God the Holy Spirit of His
   glory.

   The Holy Spirit is also God, not a power, a light or a talent, but a
   divine Person, fully equal with the Son in majesty and glory, who does
   not enter our lives for a limited time. He is not restricted by time,
   but participates from before the beginning of time to the end that will
   never come, co-eternal and of the same substance with that of the
   Father and the Son. The Son came first to comfort the elect of the
   Father and after Him the Holy Spirit.

   But is it possible to "comfort" those who jubilate without ever
   mourning, who do not confess their pain nor realize the misery that
   surrounds them? What does the insensitive and ignorant general public
   know or what even those who confess their misery? The public recognizes
   misery only when things don't go their way, as when they struggle with
   worry or sickness, when their wealth is threatened or, worse, when they
   lose a family member. That's why they may gush about the "Father in
   Heaven" when He has filled their cupboards, restored their health and
   supported them in bereavement.

   For those who live life at a deeper dimension, it is misery when the
   load of a sinful life oppresses them, when their conscience is restless
   and when they are tormented by the question what will become of them in
   eternity. This attitude does not constitute love so much as fear and
   that fear makes them accept the kiss of the cross and confess that Son
   who redeemed from sin through His death and opened Heaven by opening
   His grave.

   But that's it for them. What more do they need? To worship a "biune"
   God as Father and Son is more than enough for most people, rather than
   to delve into the depth of that mysterious triune Eternal Being and
   worship Him.

   Like a stump without roots, such a teaching is not true doctrine but
   mere muttering of unintelligible words. Genuine doctrine, that is, a
   conscious reflection of the Eternal God, becomes true only in spiritual
   practice in the depth of the soul. To learn to know that Eternal Being
   as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, to praise Him and to fully delight in
   returning love to Him Who loved us first, that is the real thing that
   cannot be accessed or scathed by mockery, logic, doubt or mental
   reservation.

   To reach this point, the pain and misery for which the Comforter will
   comfort us, must thus be understood at a deeper level than simply as
   pain over adversity or a conscience full of angst or fear of hell. No,
   the true misery, that "deep misery" that is the Holy Spirit's target,
   lies in the depth of love. God is love. Therefore He cannot rest until
   love becomes the constitution of His Kingdom. Even the most vivid
   imagination cannot possibly conjure up the delights and blessings that
   await our experiences once those waters of eternal love roll over us.

   God is love. His sovereign power that rules over the human race, is
   present in a hidden form in the weak copies of earthly arrangements
   like marriage, friendship and love between generations. Love is that
   Eternal Being. That is the reason fallen, sinful and egoistic
   creatures, even while in their state of perdition and encased by sin,
   are so emboldened by sin and flattered by things like public ovation,
   admiration, love and endearment.

   He is love. And now notice the deeper channel. There is no real sense
   of sin so long as the sadness flowing out of that love does not rend
   our heart into shreds. There is no real or genuine pain in mere
   adversity as long as we do not sense the sadness that arises only from
   His love that should sadden us. At the same time, there is no faith, no
   piety, no godly life that, once it has experienced the love from that
   Holy Being, does not feel the awakening of the indescribable,
   irresistible and almost desperate impulse to be near to God and to hide
   under His wings.

   ================

   Do you understand anything of this kind of misery? No, I am not asking
   whether you understand it completely. But do you have any inkling at
   all, even the slightest, of that homesickness with its untraceable
   sources? This is a homesickness not for the location of all that glory,
   but for Him Who lives and is enthroned there and from Whom, as the
   deepest well of everything salvific, all the blessings of salvation
   flow.

   Do you know anything about this? Not with your passionate imagination,
   your fanatic emotions, in over-exertion, or as something outside of
   yourself. No, but in that calm, quiet, deep-going awareness that
   translates with increasing clarity the waterless pits of your own
   heart. Along with that awareness come the distresses and needs of your
   inner feelings and pains which, while all the time teaching and
   reproving you, show you where you are shortchanging yourself and where
   your problem lies. That is to say, what is at base the deepest ground
   of this devouring misery that you never comprehend.

   If you're at this point, then, my brother or sister, laugh even while
   you're weeping, for that is a sign or proof that "love has once again
   poured into your heart" (Romans 5:5). By nature you did not have it in
   you. To be in suffering and misery, and at the same time to be blind
   with respect to the real nature of it, is precisely the deadly wound
   that through the fall you also share. In order to again feel the pain
   of love, love has to be more pro-active and dynamic. There would be no
   redemption in the statement, "He loved us first," if this other
   statement, "The love poured into our hearts" did not follow the first.

   The Lord has been evoking the pain of love throughout the ages with a
   special fondness for His elect. These were His elect or, if you will,
   those that had already received grace and were affected by it. They
   were the oppressed, tossed about and driven by storms, the
   discomforted. They were miserable not because of but through which they
   received grace and therefore, by divine intervention, became
   beneficiaries of the innermost tender and holy compassion.

   These recipients of grace once again felt they should be near that God.
   The awareness again awoke in them that they were naturally inclined
   towards God and were created for the Holy one of Israel. They were
   created not in order to waste animal sacrifices for Him, but as a
   friend cherishes his friend, so walk with Him that He can address their
   soul and that soul respond to Him.

   They did not fathom the depth of this love, but they did drift along
   with its current, constantly farther away from the visible in order to
   seek Him, the Only. But He wasn't there; the world always stood between
   them with all of its needs, its wealth and its hustle and bustle. They
   themselves stood in the way, their own ego, their godless
   faithlessness, their continued shameless whoring after other gods. They
   no longer had faith in their own love and no longer thirsted after Him.
   They no longer called upon Him, prayed to Him, they the hypocrites, the
   pious pretenders, the faithless ones! That is the life of suffering and
   pain. It has its thousands of victims. They are like a woman whose time
   has come, but who does not have the strength to deliver.

   =============

   You who love the pathways of superficiality, know where you're at. For
   one who finds himself in such a situation, it is sweet to succeed,
   while the very thought of entering Heaven with a faithless heart and to
   look God in the eye is a horror. This kind of situation is simply
   impossible.

   Such a one is privileged, highly privileged, so high that love has been
   poured into him. It is precisely that gracious gift of love that
   becomes his undoing, that drives him on and presses him, so that
   bearing this load exhausts him. The world is against him; His own heart
   provokes him; sin and the devil mock and tease him as they perform the
   dance of death around his crushed soul.

   Oh, if only he had wings, he would fly upwards. Doing so would be
   within his power. He could even commit suicide, but that is forbidden.
   There is that same consuming fire, that grim vengeance that curses all
   suicide as scandal, abomination and offence against His holiness.
   Walled in all around; no exit or escape. The only remaining option is
   to lay down without comfort, prey to a power that he cannot restrain
   with only the prayer on the lips, "Oh, if only You returned and there
   were windows in the Heavens." Ah, thirsting like a panting deer (Psalm
   42).

   ============

   That thirsting is a thirst after the living, triune, most glorious God,
   a thirst after Father, Son and Holy Spirit! It is a thirst that cannot
   be quenched until everything that separates, prevents and beclouds
   drops away. It will not be stilled until there is no more world to
   distract you, no more time to drain away, no more sinful heart to lead
   astray and no more devil lurking in the dark to lure you away from the
   One. What that thirsting child seeks will not be found until all its
   half-heartedness has dissolved, threatening clouds have dissipated and
   fleshly thought overcome. When that happens, you desire to worship,
   that is, truly worship from the soul, and the gift you have just
   received is not overcome by other urgings the next moment. At that
   point even your personal limits cease to be limits for God and you have
   been absorbed into the congregation of the justified, into the
   congregation that has the Spirit and the Mediator as Head, into the
   congregation in which His body shines through, absorbed you into
   Himself in order to dwell in you and to fulfill all that can be
   fulfilled in you until filled with all the fullness of God.

   All the above will not happen on earth. It won't even happen fully with
   dying. It won't happen before the day of His return, but on that day it
   will be Him in all His glory.

   =============

   That is why the Compassionate One does not just leave things as they
   are. He does not look at the discomfort and suffering of those without
   comfort with indifference. After all, He is your Saviour! "Merciful" is
   His Name! He has designed salvation so that you will never find the
   recipients of His grace, those that have experienced the pain of the
   love poured into their hearts, without a Comforter sent by Him!

   In the days of the Patriarchs, the Comforter used to come in visions
   and appearances, in judgements and in divine discourses (Genesis
   12:1-3; 13:14-17; 15-whole chapter; 16:7-12; 17:1-22; 18--whole
   chapter; 19:1-22; 20:6-7; 21:12-13, 17-19; 22:1-18; 26:2-5, 23-24;
   28:12-15; 31:3; 32:22-30; 35:1, 9-15; 46:2-4). In Moses' days the robe
   of this Comforter rustled in the billows of the Red Sea (Exodus 10:19;
   13:18; `15:4). He came in the manna falling from Heaven (Exodus 16;
   Numbers 11:9), while Israel saw Him regularly in the column of smoke
   during the day and in the pillar or column of fire at night (Exodus
   13:20-22). Thus that Comforter continued to come down to the people of
   God in the various representations of His works of holiness, in His
   hand of rescue, in dreams and ecstatic experiences, but above all in
   the word of prophecy. When the dispensation of shadows came to an end,
   then the Son came and every soul that thirsted after God, cleaved to
   Him and was comforted and blessed in the sight of His love.

   But He did not stay. The cross came and their hearts were again moved,
   while the souls of the elect quavered like tree top when the wind moves
   through the forest at night. And then, then came the promise: "I will
   ask the Father, and He will give you another advocate to help you and
   be with you forever-- the Spirit of truth" (John 14:16-17). Thus came
   Pentecost Day, when God Himself descended into the hearts of believers,
   lived in the Church of Christ and entered the temple that He had
   chosen, saying, "This is the place of My rest."

   And then there was rest, rest from that endless toil without comfort.
   It was a foretaste of that eternal rest that remains for the people of
   God.

   Meditation 11*

   The Living God Among You

   This is how you will know
   that the living God is among you....
   Joshua 3:10

   That immaculate, imperishable and mysterious Body of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, the Church, is a miraculous element on this earth. Nothing
   unclean gets into it and not a single one of God's chosen is outside of
   it. It has the anointing of the Holy Spirit and knows all things. All
   the powers of eternal life and all the glories of the Kingdom find
   protection in it. No child of God has ever tasted a single consolation
   on earth; nor has any pilgrim to the new Jerusalem ever been blessed by
   any durable spiritual revival that did not flow through the veins of
   that sacred Body of the Lord to him.

   That Body of Christ is real; it is not a figment of our imagination. It
   is not a symbolic expression for an idealistic conception. To the
   contrary, this Body of our Lord exists in the full sense of the word.
   When at the end of days everything shall perish and even the elements
   melt down, it is only that Body, but in its wholly pure and unblemished
   form, that will remain in its integral state.

   An even stranger miracle is that this Body of our Lord always appears
   on earth both in its being and doing in the mist of our sins and lack
   of spirituality, but without itself ever mixed up with this sinfulness
   or scathed by this imperfection. Take note of how sinful and imperfect
   the Church of the Lord has been throughout the ages. In spite of that,
   with all the corruption and bane that clings to her, she is and never
   was anything other than the imperfect, veiled revelation of the Body of
   Christ. No matter how thick and close the fog obscured the glory of
   that Body, even in its most degenerate periods, that sacred, mystical
   Body of Christ has hardly ever surrendered even a minimum of its
   complete perfection. Whether you praise the Augustines and Calvins of
   the flourishing periods of her history or mourn the Husses, Teelincks
   or Comries of her ignominious days, the drops of the water of life
   sparkled in the eyes of their souls with equal crystal clarity and that
   those who jubilate and those who mourn both are comforted by the same
   deep mercy of the one living God.

   If the above talks about the Body's being, we must aver the same of the
   doing or works that emanate from this Body through God's children, that
   is, the "good works" of which the Bible speaks (Ephesians 2:10). They
   are the work of God done by His children through His works. God adopted
   these puny creatures as His children and then empowered them with the
   will to do the good, that is, that which brings glory to His Name. All
   these good works originally were hidden potentials in the Body of
   Christ, but eventually sprouted up out of that Body through us.

   That is the reason those beautiful flower buds cannot sprout fully here
   on earth. As no pure white snowflake falls on the earth without the
   earth tarnishing it with her dirt and dust, so it has never happened in
   even one single child of men that a good work descend in him from the
   Father of lights without the person polluting it. There is thus nothing
   pure on earth. Rather than avoiding this fact by lightly gliding over
   it, we should ask whether it is not terribly sinful for us to
   constantly stain the most glorious and finest artworks of God's Holy
   Spirit with our polluted fingers.

   But no matter how readily we acknowledge this all, it does not hurt the
   Body of Christ in the least. Whether we stain our good works with al
   our sinful addictions or spoil them with our unholy intentions, it will
   not spoil these works in the eyes of God. If these works have come to
   us out of the Body of Christ, then they have been established through
   faith. It is that faith that ensures that the work of God in us is
   untouchable. It may appear to be blemished, but on closer look it turns
   out to be merely skin deep, a surface superficiality.

   It is there that the mystery resides and the reason that God's children
   on earth, preceded by the holy Apostles, lament every morning and
   evening, "We all stumble in almost everything and there is nothing
   whole in us." At the same time, you hear those same pilgrims, again
   preceded by those same Apostles, call out triumphantly, "Whoever is
   born of God, does not sin; in fact, he cannot sin, for His seed remains
   in him."

   Pay attention: His seed remains in him! That resident seed contains
   those hidden powers of that mystical Body. That is that hidden life
   that for the present remains in the shadow as the kernel in a grain of
   seed tarries, but in the meantime pushes and thrives.

   =============

   What, it must be asked, is the secret key to this holy and worshipping
   witness on which the justification of the godless and the peace of
   God's children depend? The one and only key is that the Holy Spirit
   lives in that Body of Christ.

   Christ is no longer on earth. He sits on the throne of glory in Heaven.
   As the psalmist exults, the crown of glory blossoms eternally on the
   head of the great Son of David. He who ascended to Heaven is there
   above for our benefit. He does not just rest there in blessed idleness,
   but, like His Father, the Son is always working. That labour, that
   divine work of the Lord Jesus in Heaven, is always on behalf of His
   people. He intercedes for His people. He validates that rich
   reconciliation through His blood for His people. As High Priest He
   serves as our only sacrifice in the Most Holy Place (Exodus 26:33-34).
   In addition, He is preparing our place and is awaiting us, calling us
   and luring us with irresistible grace. In other words, He isn't just
   working in Heaven, but He constantly works out of Heaven also on earth.

   The Lord Jesus is only in one place. He lives in human flesh like ours
   and thus cannot possibly be in two places at the same time. Even though
   in the glory of Heaven much of our earthly limitations fall away,
   Heaven is not a place of magic. It is a real world where it is natural
   for every place to be separated from all other places; they do not
   overlap.

   Even though Jesus Christ is restricted to one place at any given
   moment, that restriction does not limit the effect of His working. His
   working continues to go out in an omnipotent way and reaches therefore
   everywhere; it simultaneously possesses the glorious power of the
   divine. The divine here is that "simultaneous!" Simultaneous, that
   means the same God is at the same moment in Asia, in Africa, in America
   and in your own city or village and continues His almighty working in
   all these places simultaneously. He is equally near everyone, but also
   so near each individual as if He heard only the cry of his soul and
   only her special prayer.

   That divine "simultaneity" is also an attribute of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. As much as He is restricted to one place, His majesty, grace
   and Spirit go out to all regions and places in the world
   simultaneously. As our mind controls each member of our body at the
   same time, so it is between this glorified Head and His mystical Body.
   However far that Body extends itself, Jesus notices it every time when
   any member of this Body suffers, just like when someone pricks your
   skin with a pin, your consciousness will notice it immediately.

   Similarly, there is not a member of the Body who is so slight that he
   is beyond the reach of the Lord Jesus or that the Lord would not be his
   soul keeper and comforter. It can be said that this Body does not have
   a life of its own, but it has its existence and lives its life in the
   Lord Jesus. The Head controls the Body, leads it and gives sparkle to
   it. It is Immanuel who blossoms in His members.

   ============

   With all this we still have not touched upon the greatest depth of this
   mystery. Even with all the above being true, that we are members of
   that Body and that this miraculous Body is animated from out of Jesus,
   this still does not explain the real mystery, namely how our "I", how
   our soul, how our inner hidden person stands in this most intimate soul
   relation with the Mediator and Saviour and exalts in it. He is the
   glorious thinking, animating, leading and protecting One, if you will,
   the working Head who alone does it all in all His members and for them.
   And there we are, in all that we are out of ourselves, working not for
   God but for satan. Should Jesus forsake us in the hour of our death,
   not expecting an ascent into Heaven but a descent into hell?

   That, that is the mystery. There the chasm gapes across which our faith
   will certainly carry us across, but that nevertheless leaves the
   mystery unsolved and calls for further explanation.

   And then that great light that now brings you to Pentecost. Do you have
   immediate direct communion with the Father? Of course not, for the
   Father may be the ground , the origin and the creating cause of
   everything, butit is not the Father who descends into His Church.

   Do you then perhaps have immediate fellowship with the Son? Even that
   is not the case, for no one can say that Christ is Lord, except through
   the Holy Spirit. To be sure, He took on your flesh and thus established
   communion with your human nature, but that is not yet to have
   fellowship with your inner consciousness. That's why it was beneficial
   for the disciplesfor Jesus to go away, for without doing so, the
   Comforter could not come.

   Do pay close attention. There is no fellowship with the Father for you
   except through the Son. For no one knows the Father except the Son and
   to whom the Son reveals Him (Matthew 11:27). Similarly, there is no
   fellowship with the Son for you, except through the Holy Spirit. For no
   one can even say that Christ is Lord, except through the Holy Spirit (I
   Corinthians 12:3). It is when the Holy Spirit comes that He takes up
   all the treasures from Christ in order to glorify Christ in you. Once
   it has come to this stage, the Holy Spirit comes to live in you and
   then in the Holy Spirit comes the Son, and in the Son also the Father.
   That is why the Lord Jesus could prophesy so gloriously: I and the
   Father shall come and live with you, that is, after the Holy Spirit
   will have descended.

   ==============

   Give this some thought with deep reverence and what will you find?
   This, that our precious, glorious Mediator, who in His deepest being
   was God, but as God adopted human nature in unity with the Persons and
   who in Himself stood in personal unity of substance with God the Holy
   Spirit from all eternity. Before the mountains were born and the
   pillars of the great abyss were established in immeasurable space, the
   Son with the Father and the Holy Spirit was/were in eternal personal
   unity of substance. Thus it could in no way be said that He, the Son,
   would first receive the Holy Spirit.

   God the Son cannot receive any power or working from God the Holy
   Spirit, for He is equal to Him in majesty and divinity. In addition,
   God the Holy Spirit cannot take up residence in God the Son, for the
   relationship between the two is not that of residing in each other but
   of divine and full unity of substance. God the Holy Spirit could
   therefore never contribute anything to God the Son. Rather it must be
   confessed that it is God the Holy Spirit who, together with the Son,
   equally proceeds from the Father.

   Thus it can in no way ever be said of God the Son, the second Person in
   the Holy Trinity, that He was filled with the Holy Spirit or received
   the Holy Spirit or entered into fellowship with the Holy Spirit. In
   order to achieve any of these, the Son would first have to cease being
   God the Son.

   But--and here we enter an even deeper remarkable step into the Most
   Holy--that Son adopted our human nature in such a way that He Himself
   became truly human. With that man Jesus Christ the situation is
   naturally completely different. The man Jesus Christ is not of one
   substance with the Father and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit did not
   proceed from the man Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit had definitely to be
   poured into, on and over the man Jesus Christ.

   The real soul mystery is that the entry into a human heart in order to
   live there, to rule and to comfort there as God, is the peculiar and
   unique work not of the first or second Persons, but it is the peculiar
   and special work of the third Person of the Holy Trinity, that is, of
   God the Holy Spirit.

   This goes so far that God the Son cannot live in the soul of the man
   Jesus Christ as God. God the Son was linked with human nature in the
   incarnation through a mysterious manner, a link that the Holy Spirit
   could never form. But to enter the soul of any human being, including
   that of the man Jesus Christ, was not the work of the Son but of the
   Holy Spirit.

   The above explains that, though He was the Son, the man Jesus Christ
   still had to receive the Holy Spirit, that the Holy Spirit poured His
   power and working on Jesus, that Jesus was filled by the Holy Spirit
   without measure, but that He nevertheless received the complete and
   rich indwelling of the Holy Spirit after He ascended into Heaven. Thus
   He could pour out the Holy Spirit for the first time through all the
   veins of His Body on Pentecost.

   ===============

   Once you have seen all this in worship, then suddenly the light
   surrounds you from all sides. Then it becomes absolutely clear how the
   Holy Spirit, who dwells in Him as our Head and in us as His members,
   could finally begin His work of giving divine comfort from that hour
   on. It is from that hour on that God the Holy Spirit, dwelling in the
   soul of the man Jesus Christ, meets in that Mediator the Son and lifts
   all the limitations of His state of humiliation.

   Now it is no longer enigmatic how the Holy Spirit can dwell in us long
   before we notice Him. Though the mother knows it, the child in her womb
   lives without being aware of anything. So it goes also in the mystical
   Body of Christ. Whether you are already living or not, whether you have
   already become conscious of your life, is immaterial. The only thing
   that counts is whether Jesus has already taken charge of your life. If
   He has, then the same situation pertains in the Body of Christ. That is
   to say, then the same animated life already pulsates in your veins just
   as a mother's blood feeds life into her as yet unborn child.

   What's more, then you can feel the great difference between the work of
   the Holy Spirit becoming noticeable in you, whether it is still merely
   the potential of the gift of the Holy Spirit, or whether it be that
   other, totally different and much deeper feature, the personal
   indwelling of God the Holy Spirit in you.

   When is the mystery of godliness perfected in you for the first time
   and the indwelling of Immanuel in you complete? It can only happen when
   the Lord God enters the very centre of your being. Within you, puny
   being that you are, this majestic God, who holds all the heavens in His
   hand, works this incomprehensible miracle of entering you, penetrates
   your unfathomable hidden being and establishes His throne in your
   heart. And from that throne He embraces your entire person and your
   innermost being in His tender mercy for now and for eternity, and
   comforts you with His deep and glorious blessings. Then and only then
   is all this possible.

   At that point, victory is assured and the triumph cannot forever be
   postponed. That's when death, sin and the devil in you suffer defeat,
   for they cannot resist God for ever. Even if all the forces of
   unrighteousness and depravity, like the tribal enemies of Israel in the
   land of Canaan in the Old Testament, were to unite against you in order
   to destroy your soul, they cannot and will not defeat you. To be able
   to do that would require them to push God the Holy Spirit out of the
   hidden kernel of your innermost being--and that they cannot possibly
   do, the simple reason being that the power of all that is created
   cannot resist God the Holy Spirit; those unholy powers are simply
   incapable of defeating God the Holy Spirit.

   And therefore, you oppressed and driven by the storms of life, be of
   good courage! Your Saviour lives to pray for you, and in you dwells and
   works God the Holy Spirit. Your God lives deep within you and He will
   not forsake or leave you. "Be strong and courageous!" (Joshua 1:18).
   Know this and pass it on to your descendants after you, saying, "The
   precise work of God the Holy Spirit in you is this, that He dwells in
   you in order to work through you." He can do that to you and you do it
   out of and through Him!

   Meditation 12*

   The Festival of the Holy Spirit

   I will pour out My Spirit on all people.
   Joel 2:28

   The Church of Christ worships the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and
   confesses these three to comprise one unified God. In so far as she as
   "Church of Christ" celebrates Pentecost, her joy neither can nor shall
   ever be anything but a declaration of an even more solemn feast day on
   which to give thanks, praise and honour to that most perfect, most
   glorious and triune divine Being, with an even deeper humility and
   higher degree of happiness.

   Our Christmas celebration focuses on that Eternal Being, for it isonly
   "God revealed in the flesh" who is capable of animating us as we kneel
   at the manger. From that Eternal Being our Easter joy is announced, for
   only the "powerful proof of His being the Son of God" can fill our
   heart with living psalms. Similarly, from that eternal Being our
   Pentecost hymns arise, for only those who worship and understand the
   Holy Spirit as God Himself, can sense something of the unending comfort
   that came down to us from Heaven during that mighty event.

   It is not a coincidence that the Body of Christ that entered the world
   with the confession of a triune God, expresses her ecstasy and her holy
   enthusiasm in a three-fold scheme of celebration. It should be clear to
   everyone that at Christmas it is the glory of the Father whose creative
   power delivers us that "holy child Jesus." On Easter the Son Himself
   appears as the Ruler of life. On Pentecost we celebrate not the feast
   of either the Father or the Son, but of the Holy Spirit. Notice that
   the Mediator, whose birth we celebrate on Christmas, who takes His life
   back on Easter and pours out His Holy Spirit on Pentecost, stands by us
   on all three occasions, but on each occasion from a clearly different
   perspective that we should notice automatically and that clearly
   constitutes a three-fold reflection of the triune God.

   And so began that last of our high feasts, Pentecost. The Body of
   Christ searches her heart as to whether she has fathomed the depth of
   this Pentecost miracle at all and out of that depth might worship her
   God in His glory. Congregation of the Lord, our souls must persist in
   remembering above all that the Pentecost miracle consisted of a
   descent, a coming down to us, a pouring out upon us of God Himself, a
   pouring out over us of a stream of actual divine life; not merely of a
   power, a gift or a radiation of peace; but an outpouring over us of a
   stream of real divine life, a coming to us of God Himself.

   Anyone who does not know all this or does not confess that the Holy
   Spirit is "of one and the same essence, majesty, and glory, with the
   Father and the Son," according to the Belgic Confession, is not part of
   this. He cannot jubilate along, is not comforted and, wandering around
   with a discomforted soul, cannot be thankful either. It all depends and
   is focused only and completely on the eternal God.

   Whatever prevents you from coming close to the Eternal Being, keeps you
   from His heart and from opening your soul's eye, that prevents you from
   gazing into the unsearchable holiness and magnificence of that perfect
   Being with a fuller and richer intensity, oh, get rid of it
   voluntarily. Don't allow it to stop and wear you down. It all depends
   on the knowledge of God and on that knowledge alone. Understand well.
   We are not talking head knowledge or knowledge residing in your memory
   or mind, but a knowledge embraced by your whole person, knowledge in
   the inner depth of your being that is part of your very breath.

   Know that the form in which that Holy Being presents itself to your
   soul on Pentecost, offers Himself to you and with blessing bows over
   you, is that of the Comforter. He does not turn to those who think
   themselves rich and self-sufficient, but reaches out to those of broken
   heart, whose souls are in His hand and who know they are poor and lost
   in misery.

   We have a Comforter not in the sense that Jesus is gone temporarily and
   the Holy Spirit has come to replace him for that time to comfort us
   during Jesus' absence. Jesus never said anything like that. What He did
   say was that Jesus Himself was the first Comforter, but when He left us
   He promised another Comforter, whose function was not to still our
   mourning over Jesus' leaving but, to the contrary, to do the same thing
   for which He had come to begin with, namely to comfort us in our
   suffering.

   Thus Jesus does not minimize that other Comforter. Rather, He declares
   that one as the real Comforter, whose work He only temporarily and in a
   very restricted circle had looked after. Indeed, he added emphatically
   that this other Comforter--the NIV also calls Him "Counselor" and
   "Advocate"--will be with them forever (John 14:16).

   Even stronger, He said, "It is for your good that I am going away.
   Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you" (John 16:7). The
   Lord has said it clearly, namely that His work of redemption is a
   means, thefinal target of which is to bring the Comforter to ourhearts
   or, if you will, that the fruit of Jesus' death comes with the descent
   of the Holy Spirit. How could it be otherwise? Understand, my reader,
   we are inclined, destined and created to "have" God. Without God, human
   life is empty, poor, deeply miserable and lost.

   To "have God" does not mean to have a God in Heaven upon whom we call
   in times of fear and distress. Neither does it mean to "have a God" who
   walks ahead of you in your path of life and with whom you stroll about.
   It means to have God within you, in your heart and soul, a God who as
   your God animates and motivates you, who drives you internally and
   penetrates you with all of His power. To miss that is what renders you
   poor and disconsolate and makes you as one tossed about by storms.
   Missing out on that constitutes the deep chaos of sin. If there is
   anything that can rescue you, save you, comfort you, discomforted one,
   it cannot be anything other than refilling that deepest need, namely
   that God Himself come down into you and make your heart His dwelling
   place.

   "Your heart a temple of God!" That, as a human being, is your creation
   decree. On the other hand, the accusation of the Eternal Love about the
   state of sinners is that, "Your heart is a desolate temple or, worse, a
   dwelling place of the evil one." But the Church of the Lord, when she
   commemorates the miracle of the Almighty on Pentecost Day, jubilates,
   "God the Holy Spirit has again descended into that empty temple!" That
   is the reason the Holy Spirit is and bears the name "Divine Comforter!"

   =============

   There's a question we must not avoid: Did the Holy Spirit comfort the
   saints of the Old Testament as well? If He did, then what was so
   special about Pentecost? Of course, we could easily do away with the
   question by citing Jesus' own saying, "If I don't go away, the Holy
   Spirit cannot come." Or put this way: "The Holy Spirit could not yet
   come, because Jesus was not yet glorified." However, we sense keenly
   that without further explanation these words seem to many only an empty
   shell. So, we need to take this question seriously and find the answer.

   To start off with, we may assume without doubt the truth of the
   confession all Christians share, namely, that the saints of the Old
   Testament shared the same sin problems we have and that, like us, they
   would not be made alive and, after death, be saved, except through the
   grace of Jesus Christ. But would these crucial similarities restrict
   God's freedom in choosing the ways and means through which He then as
   well as now carries out His plans? And is it not even now in the days
   of the New Covenant completely clear that the Lord God treats infants
   who die, differently from us whom He calls later and has had time to
   work on?

   That being the case, who would dare to deny that the Lord our God also
   used different ways and means of gathering the saints before Christ
   than it pleased Him to use for the comforting of His people after
   Christ? Don't promise and fulfillment mean different things? Does it
   not make a difference whether you live under an Israel-specific
   dispensation or a world-embracing grace? And does not everything change
   whether you still live in the circle and ages characterized by miracles
   or were born in the days of gradual, quiet, spiritual development?

   If all these situations have brought about differences, should doubt
   then arise in our hearts as to whether this same Almighty God, who had
   called this temporary household of Israel into being, would have had
   ways and means, in conformity with that earlier faith situation, to
   apply the inner comfort of the Holy Spirit to His chosen ones during
   the older covenant with Israel? Is not the inspiration of the prophets
   not a totally different, unique, wonderful and super glorious working
   of the Holy Spirit that wholly differs and deviates from the way of the
   Spirit in our souls?

   Is it then so unthinkable that there were ways in which the working of
   the Holy Spirit also in those earlier ages would reach those faithful
   ones? Don't we read about such workings in the stories of Balaam
   (Numbers 22) and Saul (I Samuel 10:11-12), though without salvific
   effect? Do we not observe the power of such workings in the stories of
   Bezalel (Exodus 31:1-5) and Joshua (Deuteronomy 34:9) with reference to
   non-spiritual situations? Do we not find that in those same Old
   Covenant times it is often and continually declared in the clearest and
   most emphatic manner that something different, better and higher is
   coming? Examples are:

   "I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring" (Isaiah 44:3).
   "I will put my Spirit in you" (Ezekiel 37:14).
   "I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will
   prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see
   visions. Even on My servants, both men and women. I will pour out My
   Spirit in those days" (Joel 2:28-29).
   "I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
   the Spirit of grace and supplication" (Zechariah 12:10).

   The multiple use of the strong word "pour" in these texts indicates
   that such spiritual abundance was unusual in those earlier days and
   that a situation of spiritual scarcity was more common and thus in
   sharp contrast to the drencher of the Spirit that would come later.

   The Holy Spirit Himself is very open in the Scriptures about this
   difference between then and now. He expresses it in strong terminology
   through the Apostle Paul, who spoke of that transition from the
   national Israel dispensation to the universal in these words: "The
   revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, but now revealed
   and made known through the prophetic writings..." (Romans 16:25-26).

   ==============

   If you look at this difference a bit closer, then you may ask whether
   it really is that difficult to distinguish. Let me try to make this
   distinction clear with a series of double examples. In the first, you
   stand at the entrance to a dark cellar below you and shine a torch
   light into the darkness. You send only a few light beams into the space
   and don't see all that much. In the parallel example, you enter into
   the cellar yourself with your torch light and see the entire space
   around you clearly.

   Another set of examples. In the first case, you feel a few soft drops
   of water fall on the thirsty ground. In the second, the ancient ice
   caps on the mountains melt away, the mountain stream increases in
   volume and the floods descend till the angry turbulent waters pour
   themselves over farm and meadow. Or the case of a canal that is in the
   process of being dug. The workers get thirsty and so you have bottles
   of drinking water brought in so they do not parch. Then there's the
   final scenario when the canal has been dug and is ready to receive the
   water flow. As the dam is opened, a torrent of water cascades into the
   riverbed and soon fills the canal in all its length and breadth.

   And now a serious question: Does not each set of examples perfectly
   illustrate the distinction between the working style of the Spirit in
   the Old and New Covenants? At first there was that sparse light from
   above, lighting only a few souls that were called by God into His
   service. Then comes Jesus with that glorious, refreshing and comforting
   light into the dark cellar of our misery in order to shine on us
   directly with a much fuller, majestic brilliance.

   In the old days only a few drops fell down. It was only when the Sun of
   righteousness melted the snow on the mountain tops that the streams
   began to frolic and the full streams of salvation cascaded down to all
   nations. And was not the very purpose of the Old Covenant dispensation
   to dig out that channel and to prepare that canal through which all the
   fields and plains would bloom? The prepping was completed when the Son
   came into this world, the dam opened up, and the waters filled the
   channel. And there were the waters of the Spirit cascading down.

   ==============

   Just what exactly is this miracle of Pentecost? It was not an
   outpouring of the Spirit in the hearts of a few individuals. That had
   already happened in the previous dispensation. That continues to happen
   whenever a sinner is born again, even today. Neither was it merely a
   milder disturbance of the waters of the Spirit in contrast to later
   violent waves that took place in the history of this sacred stream of
   the Spirit. Over against ages of marshy spiritual quagmire, the Church
   knows of powerful spiritual revivals throughout the succeeding ages,
   also after Pentecost.

   If you wish to understand the miracle of Pentecost, then do not search
   for it in the conversion of the Apostles nor in the spiritual revival
   of those gathered on that day. You should not rest until you recognize
   that the event on Pentecost Day had never happened before or can ever
   happen again, but that it is as unique and single a miracle as the
   birth of the Child in the manger and His resurrection from the grave.

   This view of the Pentecost feast should not lead to pious lamentations
   or ingenious discoveries on the part of Pentecostals, but only to the
   revelation of the Word. That Word tells you that we are not dealing
   with a few individual believers; there is a Body of Christ, that is, a
   strong cohesive, internal, organic, divinely constructed work of art.
   That Church has become one with the Mediator, one single plant. A
   better way of saying it, she has become one Body with Him through which
   He moves, through whose veins His life blood flows; that He stirs,
   feeds and leads her as her Head.

   To be sure, Christ also chooses, knows and loves individuals, including
   the least and the smallest amongst them. However, He chooses, knows and
   loves those individual souls only as living stones in the walls of that
   holy temple, only as living cells of that glorious Body, as members of
   and as indwelling in that Bride for whom He is waiting with tender
   longing in the halls of eternity.

   Indeed, the Mediator did already possess a premature form of that
   Church, of that glorious organism, of the hidden structure of His holy
   Body, of that coming and rising temple of God! But Israel was not the
   real thing. God's plans were much richer, much wider and much more
   glorious. This Church was to include all nations. The extent of that
   organism was intended to coincide with that of the world. The
   structures of His glorious Body were to be oriented towards the entire
   human race. The cedar trees with which that Temple of God was built (1
   Kings 5:5-6) came from the mountain of nations! That, said the Apostle,
   was God's plan, the council of His pleasure, His glorious intention.
   Throughout the preceding ages that plan was under construction and
   being worked on.

   It was not until Jesus' Ascension that all the necessary preparations
   were completed and thus reached the "fullness of time." Now the doors
   of the temple of God could be opened for the Holy Spirit to descend.
   That finally was the time the stream of the Holy Spirit could pour
   Himself out into the channel that Jesus had prepared in His Church!

   Meditation 13*

   Who Set His Holy Spirit among Them

   (Isaiah 63:11)

   They have lied about the Lord;
   they said, "He will do nothing!
   No harm will come to us;
   we will never see sword or famine.
   The prophets are but wind
   and the word is not in them;
   so let what they say be done to them."
   Jeremiah 5:12-13

   This is what the living God, the Almighty, did on Pentecost: He placed
   His Holy Spirit in our midst! Not in the middle of the world, but in
   the middle of the Church. Understand well: not exclusively in the
   "congregation of the elect," but in the congregation of confessing
   members, those who were baptized, those who are served by His Church
   and through that official service stand in relationship with Him, the
   Most Glorious. It is in the midst of that community that the Holy
   Spirit descended or, to put it stronger, in whose midst God Himself
   placed the Holy Spirit.

   The Holy Spirit now really resides there in the midst of that broad,
   baptized community. His residence there is not only indirectly in and
   through the Word or in and through the preachers and shepherds of the
   flock. Nor is His residence merely indirect and figurative in and
   through the holy institutions of prayer and liturgy, of sacrament and
   alms giving. It is also a direct presence as God the Holy Spirit in His
   very Person stands in our midst.

   Yes, He resides in our midst, but not merely in the hearts of some
   individuals who are born again, who have repented and been sanctified,
   but He is present in the midst of the congregation, in the community of
   the baptized members. This is so even in the unlikely but possible
   scenario in which not a single new convert has come to the Light after
   the previous generation of God's born-again children have long since
   moved on to their eternal home.

   Yes, even under such circumstances the Holy Spirit stands among us ever
   since Pentecost Day as a silent Witness, as a barely noticed figure, as
   a whispering Pray-er, as a fearful Accuser, and as a glorious
   Comforter, but always in our midst, because that's where He has been
   placed by God Himself. He stands there as the Spirit of God, as the
   Head Person in the entire congregation, as the Interpreter of Christ's
   treasure and wealth, as the Replacement of our glorified Jesus and as
   the holy Messenger, who preserves the communion between Christ and His
   Bride.

   True, the world does not see Him, because it does not know Him. The
   worldly person sees something of His presence at best very seldom,
   because He does not come with an external or physical face.
   Nevertheless, He is there and God's children see and know Him. It is in
   and for these children of God that He prays with inexpressible
   sighings, He, their Inspirer, their Guide, their spiritual and inner
   Teacher, their Comforter, their God! Whatever happens from here on,
   whether the Word does it, the Sacrament or the Preacher, these are all
   merely subsidiary instrumental workings that always receive their
   initial push and energy from the Holy Spirit.

   The Holy Spirit is not a coincidental agent that blesses everything and
   makes it all flourish. To the contrary, it is the Holy Spirit who does
   everything: He motivates, causes and mobilizes it all. He uses the
   Word, the Sacraments and the Preacher, derives the good news from the
   Son in order to preach it to you, and all of this in communion with the
   Son and the Father. The divine order of things as established in the
   congregation of Christ is as follows: the Father, the Creator; the Son,
   the Preparer; the Holy Spirit, the Distributor.

   That is why the Holy Spirit does not want morality preaching; He wants
   something much deeper. It is everyone's duty to "do good." Anyone
   failing to do the good contravenes God's law. But if, in addition, I
   establish a covenant between myself and you and you contravene the
   terms, then you do worse. Now you are not merely "not good," but you
   are unfaithful.

   Let's take it a little further. If, driven by love and compassion, I
   continue to warn you, but you mock my spiritual words of warning and
   harden yourself against my compassion, then you are no longer merely
   bad and unfaithful, but you now are committing the sin against the Holy
   Spirit (Mark 3:39; Luke 12:10). That can become the situation in the
   congregation of Christ. That congregation will be recognized by three
   things. First, whether she does good works, for it is God's inalienable
   right to demand that she do them. Secondly, whether she does the good
   in the power of the covenant of grace that envelopes us. Thirdly,
   whether she hears and obeys the Word of the Holy Spirit that warns us
   against our evil and faithlessness or whether she despises and ignores
   it.

   Israel did the latter. It contravened God's right and thus was bad. It
   defiled God's covenant and thus was unfaithful. And when the Merciful
   nevertheless sent preachers to call them to repent, for the judgement
   is at hand, Israel dared to ridicule them, "The prophets are but wind
   and the word is not in them; so let what they say be done to them"
   (Jeremiah 5:12-13). Now, that was to despise the Holy Spirit, to sadden
   and insult Him. This was the reason judgment needed to break out over
   Israel.

   But what of now? Now, after Pentecost? Now that the Holy Spirit Himself
   stands in the midst of the congregation to plead for Jesus, to warn us
   about the world and to burn God's holy covenant onto our hearts?

   What do you think, my reader? Could you ever achieve a depth of
   suffering to even remotely sense how the Holy Spirit grieves, how
   deeply He suffers and mourns about how we live in our present age?

   Meditation 14*

   The Temple of the Holy Spirit

   ...built on the foundation of the apostles
   and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself
   as the chief cornerstone. In Him the
   whole building is joined together and
   rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
   Ephesians 2:20-21

   Pentecost is the feast of the Holy Spirit, but what is it that the
   Church confesses about the Holy Spirit on that day?

   That Spirit was poured out after having been promised by Jesus, poured
   out from the Father by Christ. This was an outpouring unlike the way He
   descends even now, just once for all, never to be repeated, in a
   totally different and unique manner.

   He descended with a sound like a rupture and a shaking of the spheres.
   The light beams and sparks that accompanied all that descended from on
   high, formed themselves into divided tongues as of fire, hovering over
   and cleaving to every believer present. The most miraculous of it all
   was that tongues were released, holy enthusiasm began to glow, the
   languages of the nations appeared to have become the commonwealth of
   the Church. Everything turned into praise and worship and in magnifying
   the holy name of God.

   Isn't this what all of us agree on? These were the facts. These were
   the wonderful happenings. This is the content of what we tell each
   other and our children on Pentecost.

   But where do we go from here? Surely, we can't leave it at this? After
   the birth of that Child in the manger in Bethlehem all kinds of
   questions arose. Where did this Child come from and why did it come
   only now. Why was it born in a manger? Similarly with Pentecost the
   questions multiplied. The spirit of each of God's children tries to
   live into the story and relive what this outpouring actually was. They
   ask why it took place only now and how these happenings relate to the
   life of our own hearts.

   Do not ignore that behind the wonder of Pentecost there lies an entire
   history during which God laboured in Israel, among the Patriarchs, and
   as far back as the Garden of Eden. During that period, chosen ones were
   also saved. Today it can only be due to the Holy Spirit and His
   descent, when a soul arises from its spiritual death. We thank the
   Spirit of God and of the Son every time the warmth of faith returns to
   our own lukewarm hearts that had become lifeless and arid but now have
   once again revived.

   What are we to make of all of this? I will put it this way: It's one of
   two things. What if Pentecost was nothing more than a revival of the
   souls of the believers in the room where this took place? Of what
   interest would that be to us? Or: This was the one and only outpouring
   ever of the Spirit; none before, none after. But then, what do you do
   with Israel and what of the work of the Spirit in our own day?

   We know with certainty from John's Gospel that the second point of the
   above two is the correct one, not the first. We read, "Up to that time
   the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified"
   (John 7:39). This obviously does not mean that the Holy Spirit was not
   yet on earth. This is a mysterious statement that always sort of haunts
   us each time Pentecost comes around.

   There is an unavoidable question that the Church constantly struggles
   to answer on basis of God's Word: Since the Holy Spirit descended on
   the Jerusalem's Pentecost well over 2000 years ago, how can we
   distinguish its manner of operating before, during and after that
   wonderful point in time? It is in order to find the answer to that
   question that we ask for your attention for what is hopefully a short
   and understandable answer.

   ============

   The beneficiaries of the Lord's salvation that will one day enter into
   glory are not mere loose individuals that stand on their own without
   any relationship to other souls. They constitute a community, a body, a
   people, a flock. All saved and souls yet to be saved together form one
   whole, they belong together and exist in a relationship to each other
   established by God. This does not mean that all souls are, can be or
   must be alike. Not at all, for they differ from each other in every
   aspect. Just as in the human body a nail is completely different from
   an eye or a hair from an artery, so also is every member of the Body of
   Christ different from everyone else, each having their own function and
   life purpose. But on Pentecost we may not for one moment forget that,
   regardless of those differences, the saved are all comprehended in that
   one Body to which we must pay special attention.

   The Scripture constantly speaks of this and has basically only two
   images of the Church, namely those of body and temple. A temple is the
   insertion of a few stones in the framework of a building that, as per
   God's plan, rises high and in which God Himself dwells. But in order to
   show that the temple image is too mechanical and too external, while
   the image of body mirrors the deep thoughts of God in a much richer
   way, the Scripture does not avoid speaking of a temple that rises up
   (Ephesians 2:21) and of living stones (I Peter 2:5). When you press the
   point, both expressions really envision a temple as a body, for a body
   grows, not a temple, and parts of a body can live, but not parts of a
   temple or building.

   The Apostles constantly return to the image of temple, a practice that
   has its basis in the Old Testament dispensation. When you come right
   down to it, a temple is merely a shell for an idol, a stone structure
   in which the idol appears on earth. Relating to that, there was also a
   temple in Israel, but it was empty, without an idol image, with only
   the brilliant glory of the Lord filling the roof vaults and arches.
   That temple was no more than an example; it pointed to Christ, whose
   flesh and blood would be the real temple in which God would appear on
   earth. "Temple" is thus the proper term for the dispensation of
   shadows, while "body" is the natural word for the dispensation of
   fulfillment. But both terms point to that one great comprehensive fact
   that the Lord God does not simply turn His chosen into a string of
   loose pearls, but He gathers them and unites them into a whole as the
   Church of the living God, the flock of the Good Shepherd, the people of
   His possession, the host of His saints.

   =============

   If we agree on the above, then it should be pointed out in the second
   place that the Body of Christ, like all bodies, does not only grow but
   also has its conception, hidden formation and birth. A child has an
   existence before it is born. According to Psalm 139:15-16, at first, it
   is wonderfully woven from an unformed clump in its mother's womb. After
   that, there comes the moment, still months before its birth, that life
   creeps into that unformed clump. And after it remains hidden in its
   secret place a few more months, does it finally exit into the life of
   the world, begins to breathe on its own and opens its eyes to the
   light.

   The above represents, almost to the smallest detail, the simple and
   obvious example of the origin and growth of the Body of Christ. The
   Body was originally born with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but it
   did definitely not begin its original existence on Pentecost. The birth
   of that body was preceded by a lengthy hidden existence, enveloped by
   swaddling clothes and bonds in the shadows, hidden in the mother's
   womb. Its existence can be traced back all the way to Paradise. That's
   where it was conceived. Since then it developed over the centuries as
   just an unformed clump. It was not until Abraham's arrival on the scene
   that its own movement of life, after slowly developing and
   strengthening, became noticeable.

   However, that Body of Christ, that Body of His Church, made its first
   public appearance on Pentecost Day. That is to say, until then it
   remained hidden in Israel's womb. Thus far, it led an unconscious life
   without breathing independently, having its own spirit or seeing the
   full light with its own eyes.

   That is exactly what happened on Pentecost. By this time, the Body was
   prepared and ready, but it still did not have its own breath, its own
   spirit or, in general, its own full life. That is precisely the pouring
   out of the Holy Spirit, that the Body of the Church on that day,
   freeing itself from womb of Israel, appeared on the scene, receiving
   the breath of life, consciously beginning to move on its own steam and
   opening its eye to the eternal light.

   Foreknown from eternity; conceived at creation; hidden in Israel till
   it began to move, and then born on Pentecost--there you have, in
   summary, the birth record of the Body of Christ. From there on, it grew
   and expanded itself and at the right time, developed and clothed in
   righteousness and bejeweled with her fineries, shall be introduced as
   the Groom.

   =============

   If we are not deluding ourselves, then this simple disclosure should
   put an automatic stop to all demurral. For one thing, this shows how
   already in Israel the Holy Spirit was working in a natural way, while
   simultaneously it could be said, "Up to that time the Spirit had not
   been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified" (John 7:39). This
   is exactly the same as with the child that was not yet born but later
   was born. Even during its incubation it lives definitely from the air
   outside, but only through the mediation of its mother. Once it has been
   born, it breathes directly and it takes in oxygen in its lungs on its
   own. So the Church of God lived also beforehand in the womb of Israel
   without experiencing any workings of the Holy Spirit, except those that
   came to her through the mediation of the national existence of Israel.
   On Pentecost this working became immediate, direct; the mother's
   function had reached its goal and fell away; the Child was born and the
   Holy Spirit now streamed into the Body itself in order to animate it
   from within.

   Then there is the apparent difficulty in the question about Jesus' role
   in the outpouring of the Spirit. That one solves itself just as easily.
   What was Jesus' business with this? Is the Holy Spirit not from God? If
   so, can God the Holy Spirit not come to His Church on His own? Those
   who speak thus forget one thing: A body once born can breathe only
   through its head. Before it is born, the fetus obtains oxygen through
   the mother's blood, not through its own head but through the mother's
   arteries. Thus in earlier days the Holy Spirit could do His work on the
   Church in which Jesus played no role, but that is no longer the case
   after the baby is delivered and the Church has arrived on the scene. Do
   not forget: the Church is the Body, but that Body is unthinkable
   without the Head and can only breathe, feed, grow and be governed
   through the Head. In addition, it is impossible to pour breath into the
   lungs of a child already born, except it opens its mouth, which is,
   again, located in the head. Similarly, it is unthinkable and impossible
   for the Holy Spirit to infuse the Body of Christ except through her
   Head. First, if you will, the Head must breathe in this Spirit and from
   there it will automatically be poured from the Head through the lungs
   and arteries into the Body.

   This, then, constitutes the outpouring on Pentecost: Through His
   Ascension Jesus has been appointed Head of His Church. Herewith the
   moment arrived at which that Church could be delivered from Israel's
   womb. Now that this has occurred, two things happen. First, the Head
   absorbs in Himself and receives the Spirit from the Father. Secondly,
   He who Himself has breathed in that Spirit and absorbed it, now pours
   it out into all His members and thus makes it flow throughout His Body.

   Thus, on Pentecost, there was not in the least anything external that
   Jesus sent down. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was simply out of
   the Head, through the lungs and arteries, into the Body of the Spirit
   that He Himself had received from the Father.

   =============

   With all this the difference between the Pentecost event and the
   present working style of the Holy Spirit in us through the ages has
   become abundantly clear. As the oxygen we breathe in has no effect on
   the members of the body unless it flows through the body, so also comes
   the Holy Spirit to us, the members of the Body, only through the Body
   of the Church. Repeated outpouring of the Holy Spirit is absurd. It is
   possible that a fetus keeps living without breathing independently, but
   that is impossible for one already born. After Pentecost, it is wholly
   impossible for there to be even one moment during which the Holy Spirit
   would be absent from the Church. That would deprive her of breath and
   she would be dead. Sometimes the living Spirit may appear to be absent,
   but in fact never is. Even during times of revival, the Holy Spirit
   never comes from outside the Church, for He always revives from within
   the Body.

   When your foot grows numb, is perhaps frozen, the warmth of life can
   only return to that foot from within the body. You can rub it, brush or
   prick it, but revived life must always come from within the body. And
   that Spirit comes only from within the Body, out of the Head.

   =============

   Thus all difficulties literally disappear; everything becomes clear and
   transparent. If after this you ask finally for what purpose that Body
   of Christ stays on earth, well, here's the ready answer. "Behind the
   work of the Holy Spirit you will always find the work of the Son, while
   behind the work of the Son always lays the work of the Father."

   The gathering of the chosen into a Church is thus not as if you find
   some disparate pieces of cloth which you then sew into a garment.
   Rather, it is like assembling shards of a piece of ceramics of which
   you know that, once assembled, they will constitute a beautiful vase.
   Since it was conceived already prior to Paradise, the image of the
   whole Church lies in the plan and foreordination of the Father. Each
   chosen member is not only called into her, but is also naturally
   inclined to fulfill precisely that spiritual life function in the Body
   of Christ that is indispensable for the growth of the whole.

   Oh, the depth of wisdom and knowledge! Lord, how unsearchable are Your
   ways! What overflowing comfort for your poor Church! Comfort also for
   our souls!

   Meditation 15*

   This Is What Was Spoken by the Prophet Joel

   This is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
   I will pour out My Spirit on all people."
   Acts 2:16-17

   We stammer and can hardly speak of that majestic happening, when on the
   tenth day after Jesus' Ascension into the highest Heaven, the Holy
   Spirit descended on the Apostles and the crowd of believers out of that
   same Heaven. Already at the Bethlehem manger, where the Son first meets
   us, do we cover our face with the veil of shortsightedness and we
   worship but do not comprehend how that awesome miracle of the
   incarnation of the Word was possible. And this was a coming in the
   flesh, an act in visible form that the eyes could see, the ears hear
   and the hands touch the Word of Life.

   How much less could we expect to understand now that not the Son but
   the Holy Spirit descends, that Holy Spirit who does not become flesh,
   but remains hidden in the spiritual, remains invisible and untouchable
   as He establishes His indwelling in the bosom of the Church and His
   temple in the hearts of the faithful.

   The Apostles, moved by His descent and outpouring, spoke in strange
   languages according to how the Spirit enabled them. How can we possibly
   analyze and find the words to describe what amounts to shadows of
   heavenly things, when the Apostle Paul later confessed that these were
   "inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell" (II
   Corinthians 12:4). Ponder, but do not analyze too much. There is
   something glorious here for your heart. Try to understand that. There
   is a river here through which flow the waters of eternal life. Try to
   bathe, immerse yourself in that. A fountain of eternal comfort is
   opening here. Try to quench your thirst from this for the comfort of
   your shriveling soul.

   There was an Old Testament promise from the Prophet Joel (Acts
   2:16-17). True, Joel's was not the only one, for there were other seers
   and prophets before him, but Joel's version was the clearest of them
   all. Of this promise, Joel gave a disclaimer: It is not mine, but it is
   the promise from the living God to the spiritless and discouraged, to
   the Church of God on earth that is so bereft of comfort. It was a word
   of compassion and mercy from Him who knows the oppression His people
   suffer even better than those who have entered deep into the Way. It
   was from that merciful God who had even more love for His old Church in
   the dispensation of shadows than for us. That is why He supported and
   upheld especially that church with promises rich with comfort.

   That old Church missed so much. She did enjoy some great privileges
   that we do not have: immediate miraculous revelations and divine
   messages through the words of the prophets. But she did not know the
   manger; she did not look upon the cross and had not yet become a temple
   of the Holy Spirit. She could not boast of what John spoke:
   "That...which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we
   have looked at and our hands have touched--this we proclaim concerning
   the Word of life" (1 John 1:1).

   However, they did not lack anything regarding their salvation. The Lord
   God also gifted His chosen among His ancient covenant people with
   faith, the faith that focused on the Messiah and that brought inner
   revival to joyful souls. But still it all fell under the shadows. She
   did not have the clarity, the transparency, that full overflowing
   measure in which we rejoice.

   We pilgrims still on our journey are behind the chosen ones already
   called up, those who now already have a taste of the glory before the
   throne. We have to be satisfied with the promise without tasting that
   glory. Likewise, Israel was behind us, who know Bethlehem, Golgotha and
   Pentecost of which they had the promise but not the realization of it
   all.

   That made them apprehensive and filled their souls with worry. It drove
   them on as in a storm. The Lord our God, who is merciful and who shares
   in the oppression His people were suffering, was aware of their
   feelings. Therefore, He sent His seers, including Joel, and through him
   opened for His people the Word of promise, that glorious vista of the
   pouring out of the Holy Spirit. It did not happen in their day, but
   they saw it from afar. It was their Nebo! (Deuteronomy 32 and 34). As
   the Lord refreshed Moses' soul by showing him the rich and fertile land
   of Canaan from the pinnacle of distant Mount Nebo, so the God of all
   mercies heard His covenant people and helped them set their eyes on the
   promise through prophecy, on these glorious things of the Spirit, from
   far off.

   That under which Israel suffered and succumbed was that its God was far
   off and not near by, not directly approachable. As the deer pants after
   water, so Israel pined after the refreshing and animating Body of the
   living God. That was what all those who feared Jehovah called for and
   for which they implored Him; not all the people, of course, but the
   faithful among them. They missed their God and could not do without
   Him. Their souls were parched during this long wait. In the midst of
   this distress and near spiritual death, Jehovah came to comfort, first
   by promising, "I am coming in the Messiah," and then by pronouncing, "I
   am coming in the Holy Spirit!"

   ==============

   Strugglers among God's people are familiar with this distress and this
   near spiritual death even today. It is a strange mystery that the
   spiritual suffering of Israel is the image of what God's chosen suffer
   throughout the ages. This is not because history retrogresses or the
   New Covenant slips again behind the Old, but because every chosen
   person individually repeats in himself the history of suffering and
   comfort of the entire people of God. The people of God in the Church
   first live through the phase of missing God, and from there move on to
   the phase of glorious possession. That is the process taking place in
   the soul of each person whom God claims. Bethlehem, Golgotha, Mount of
   Olives, Pentecost--it was all there and they knew about them, but they
   could not penetrate or enter as yet; they were still left out and did
   not yet taste the sweetness of the deep kernel of holiness.

   So, they sing along with the angels' Christmas song in the fields of
   Ephratha (Luke 2:13-14), but in their souls they cry out in anguish,
   "Where is my God?" A stirring lamentation wells up from their hearts as
   they gaze on that terrible struggle in Gethsemane and on Golgotha. They
   still ask, "Who delivers me from my sin?" On Easter morning, they
   jubilate with the crowd but still call out, "Who is my righteousness?"
   On the Mount of Olives they watch their Saviour ascend, but sigh, "Who
   opens the portals of Heaven for me?" Similarly, on Pentecost they
   testify to the wind, fire and foreign languages, but in their souls
   they continue to groan after fellowship with the living God. That's the
   kind of enigmas we ourselves are. We are like children who play with
   pearls and rubies, but who go hungry for lack of bread.

   And that is why this prophecy is also for us. Paul says it so
   convincingly, "For everything that was written in the past was written
   to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and
   the encouragement they provide we might have hope" (Romans 15:4). With
   the same promises and prophecies with which the Lord God used to
   refresh His ancient covenant people, does He still refresh the
   comfortless souls today. That is to say, all those souls who genuinely
   and truly pine after the living God but do not enjoy the glorious
   fellowship of the Holy Spirit.

   Until, until.... finally the working of the Holy Spirit penetrates so
   deeply in such a soul, that the channel is finally fully dug and the
   waters of life can flow through it. That's when the full joy of
   salvation comes upon him. That's when the foolish child first becomes
   aware what a treasure it has possessed for years in his pearls and
   rubies. Then it happens: The mystery of the manger suddenly opens up
   along with that of Golgotha; the mystery of the Spirit discloses
   itself; and the newly comforted give thanks for this loving radiance
   from God's comforting face, exclaiming with joyful recognition, "Abba
   Father!"

   =============

   There are some individuals who, not having a clear understanding of the
   "things of God," think that they have experienced an outpouring of the
   Holy Spirit, a kind of repetition of a mini Pentecost wonder. Some even
   use a special term for it: "Baptism of the Holy Spirit."

   That is not possible. That would amount to negating the great Pentecost
   of the Church. Similarly, there have been people in past ages that
   consider the birth of Christ in their heart their Bethlehem with such
   strong emphasis that they lose the original Bethlehem and, eventually,
   even deny it. Keep an eye on that exaggerated form of
   over-spiritualization. No, God's way is not a matter of soul and soul;
   it is first of all of God with His Church. From there He moves to each
   individual member of His chosen flock. He is victorious over sin by
   means of returning and bestowing the human race with His glorious and
   sweet fellowship. His first step is to come to His Church with
   prophecy, then to His Church in the Son and, finally in the most
   intimate and innermost mode He comes to His Church in the outpouring of
   the Holy Spirit.

   In the natural creation, God the Lord does not grant each city and
   village a separate river, but He opens the sluices of Heaven over His
   mountains for everybody, so that the mighty streams of water cascade
   from the mountain tops down into the rivers, from where they flow forth
   until they irrigate all lands and states. So in the kingdom of grace is
   His work not piecemeal, dealing with every individual entity, but flows
   down from the mountain of His holiness in one single mighty stream till
   all chosen peoples and every chosen soulwill be refreshed and washed
   according to individual circumstances of time and place.

   Thus, Pentecost does not repeat itself. It is a single event that does
   not come and go, but that one single unique descent has its effect from
   then till the present day. Anyone who wants to partake even now in that
   Spirit can only do so by partaking in what was poured out only once,
   descended only once, but that now dwells in us and in His Church.

   This is what was prophesied by the Prophet Joel to the soul that called
   upon the Spirit, who still had to come down from above, "Take note, God
   the Lord is now in his Holy Spirit with and in you. Your Church is no
   longer alone. The Lord is in her and is her God!" [1]

   Oh, indeed there is a breaking through of the Holy Spirit into the soul
   that earlier resisted Him. What used to be a lifeless and frozen soul
   has now become more fluid. What at one time appeared spiritless,
   motionless and lifeless, is now animated and lively. Yes to all of
   this, but a repetition of the descent of the Holy Spirit as on
   Pentecost, that will not happen.

   ==============

   What then is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and wherein does it
   differ from the separate working out of Heaven in each chosen one, head
   for head? We do not deny that God the Lord could work on each soul. Why
   not? He is almighty. Even the decisions made in the council of God that
   govern all things, are sovereign and bound by nothing. The thing is,
   the Lord did not choose to do things that way; He chose another way
   that is clearly demarcated in His council. Kicking against it makes no
   difference; it will change nothing. Things go according to His will.
   The way He has chosen has been staked out in such a way that the souls
   of His chosen ones cannot be comforted except in the communion of
   saints; that is to say, in the organic operation of the Body of Christ,
   which is His Church.

   Now, as in a body not all parts breathe--the hand doesn't; the foot
   doesn't; the eye doesn't--but they all keep their life and shine
   through the single breath cycle of the entire body. So it also goes in
   the Body of the Church. On Pentecost, God blew the breath of life into
   the Body of the Church by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
   Consequently, the Holy Spirit now lives as the heavenly breath cycle
   both in the Head and in the members of the Body. It is through the
   breath of the Holy Spirit that every member of the Body lives.

   Just how does all that work? If you can explain to me how, in the
   mystery of natural life, the breath out of your lungs makes your eye
   sparkle, then I will explain the mystery of spiritual life, which is
   that the Spirit of grace comforts the soul of each member. We cannot
   penetrate that secret. You can only worship, admire and rejoice in this
   mystery.

   Worship--that is to say, kneel down in deep reverence and thank your
   God and Father, who now for twenty centuries has been blowing the
   breath of life into the Body of the Church by giving her the Holy
   Spirit. Admire and pay attention to the manifold wisdom of God, who,
   since the descent of the Spirit, has spread His Church abroad
   throughout the whole world and has turned the face of the world around.
   But also rejoice for yourself, as member of the Body of Christ, and
   cherish along with fellow saints the warmth of that life that has been
   flowing throughout the Body of Christ out of the breath of the Spirit
   for twenty centuries.

   ================

   And what is all this? This comforting, that breathing, that glorious
   rejoicing? You must know that these things have nothing in common with
   the excitement of ecstasy or with arousing cheer and song. Pompous
   tones and high sounding songs are not inviting to the Spirit but ban it
   far away. No, this comfort is for the quiet kind of suffering and is
   imbibed in holy calm. The joy comes when you become aware of the sin of
   your deeply miserable heart.

   It is possible that you have long thirsted after righteousness and
   pined for having the will to do good works, but you are constantly
   disappointed, for your heart deceives you. You just could not carry
   through, so that at the end, now suffering the most fearful tension,
   you cried out in despair, "I want to be holy, but I can't." If this is
   how you suffer and are oppressed, bent over in misery till you feel,
   "God must have His way with my soul," but it does not happen--that is
   the sad thirst in you after God, who will work a permanent conversion
   in you. It is during that fearful doubt that God the Holy Spirit comes
   quietly knocking on the door of your heart and calls you with this
   imagined invitation: "Oh, you without comfort, weep no more. Your
   prayers and sighings have ascended before the face of God. You have
   been heard. Your oppression shall come to an end and the fear in your
   soul shall fade away. For now I know that you have groaned to your God
   in uprightness of heart for delivery from sin and the ability to become
   holy. Here I am, I, your God, who will make His indwelling also in your
   heart. What you are incapable of doing, that I, God, shall do for and
   in you. I will bend your will towards the good. I shall cleanse your
   inclinations, purify your imagination and enlighten your eyes. No
   matter how much unrighteousness from the pool of perdition still
   bubbles up in your unclean heart, I will see to it that you will walk
   in my ordinances!"

   After the Holy Spirit no longer just says this but actually does it and
   the soul sees that the Spirit is establishing this in her, then she is
   no longer powerless. Instead, she is now capable of moving what seemed
   like mountains. That's when the sound of jubilation will be heard, and
   the glorious experience of restoration in her innermost being will be
   felt. She will know what it means that, in the words of the Heidelberg
   Catechism, "Christ, by his Holy Spirit, makes me whole-heartedly
   willing and ready from now on to live for him."

   Tongues of Fire

   They saw what seemed to be
   tongues of fire that separated
   and came to rest on each of them.
   Acts 2:3

   Rulers wear crowns; heroes are given laurels and wreaths. Even if we do
   not come from a ruler clan or are not heroes, every human being on
   earth struggles for honour, glitter and glory; everyone reaches for a
   crown. Our hearts beat faster when we are wreathed with honour.

   Is that a sinful inclination? Is that allowed? Or must a child of God
   surrender such ambitions? Paul the Apostle answers, "No, absolutely
   not! It does not have to be surrendered." He brazenly affirms this
   attitude. Even he himself, after he entered into the service of Jesus,
   was aiming for a crown and struggled to attain one. In fact, he was
   animated by the hope of one day receiving his crown (1 Corinthians
   9:25; Philippians 4:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:19; 2 Timothy 4:8).

   But--and here's the difference--he did not expect one until the end of
   this dispensation. His crown will not be placed on his head by the
   hands of friends, but by those of the righteous Judge. That crown will
   not bring him some pseudo-splendour but will truly make him king: "And
   (He) has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and
   Father" (Revelations 1:6).

   You see, there are two kinds of light, two kinds of splendour, two
   kinds of honour. The first one comes from below, is generated in the
   fire of ambition, fanned by imaginative honour and recognized in the
   glitter of metal or jewel. This is the glamour of artificial light that
   will soon lose its brilliance and be extinguished. It is a pseudo
   glitter that flares up one moment and is quenched in the next. But
   there is another splendour that does not originate from below but from
   above, with the Father of all lights, from the chambers of eternal
   splendour. It radiates our way from the depth of the holy Unseen and
   outshines the sun by far, while it is not consumed throughout eternity.

   He whose eye is captivated from below, is blind to that higher
   splendour. For him it does not exist and since he does not notice it,
   it cannot captivate him either. But take a godless person who comes to
   Christ and now is desirous of that nobler splendour. For him, that
   bright earthly glamour pales and wanes immediately. He turns away from
   it. For him, it no longer has glamour. What once seemed pleasing
   glitter, has become dull and lost its glamour for him.

   ===============

   Do realize that all this is more than speaking in metaphors; we are
   talking reality. You cannot think of Christ in His glory with a dull
   and worried face. When you consider Him, you cannot but imagine Him
   radiating a wreath of soft and holy light, glittering in a glow greater
   than diamonds, not by means of fantasy, no, but radiating from within
   His innermost Being. It is like His holy Person stepping outside of
   Himself with the fragrance of anointing surrounding Him. Even the
   mediator of the Old Covenant, Moses, according to the Holy Scriptures,
   when he descended from the mountain, such bright light shone on and
   around his face, so that the people could not tolerate seeing his face.
   He had to cover his face in order to address the people face to face
   (Exodus 34: 29-35).

   For this reason, the Church of Christ has accustomed us from ancient
   times on to depict the holy Patriarchs and the Martyrs, the holy
   Apostles and Prophets with halos around their heads. The point was that
   those people were the pure of heart who had climbed up the mountain of
   God's holiness and had caught a reflection of the light of the glory of
   the Eternal One on their faces. Tender, pious, God-fearing men and
   women who were appointed as beacons of light in the midst of the
   Church, have sometimes left the impression of having something higher
   radiating from their eyes and of having an expression of holiness on
   their faces. They may be compared to angels, those heralds from Heaven
   who are seldom seen on earth, but who have a higher glory surrounding
   them that even emanates from their robes.

   Whenever it pleases God to take someone home and the deceased enters
   into the rest of the Lord, sometimes we witness a kind of radiance
   around him during or even after his going, so that greeters are jealous
   and rapt.

   ===============

   When the Holy Spirit descended on Pentecost and divided tongues fire
   settled on each believer, the latter had an experience similar to that
   of the disciples at the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-8;
   Luke 9:28-36; II Peter 1:16-18).

   At the Transfiguration, the Lord received His crown and radiated
   heavenly glory, while on Pentecost the believers, who constituted the
   kernel of the Church, were baptized with glory like princes and rulers,
   and received the heavenly diadem of light on their foreheads, so that
   no crown or wreath from below would ever be coveted by those purchased
   by Jesus.

   The Church of Christ declines in spiritual power when worldly wreaths
   are disseminated in her midst by human hands, but she increases in
   spiritual power as earthly glitter fades from her midst and tongues of
   fire and the luster of the spiritual diadem of light once again appear
   among believers. The cross of Jesus is powerless and the blood of
   reconciliation without effect when people kneel at the cross who seek
   honour with the finest of worldly ornaments and who are decorated with
   wreath and crown by their fellow sinners. But that cross blesses and
   the effect of the divine blood penetrates deeply, when those who kneel
   at the cross first take off all those ornaments, wreaths and crowns and
   throw them at the foot of the cross.

   And you, my brother, my sister, what shines and glitters on you? By
   what glory do you see yourself surrounded? Is yours still earthly
   glitter? Oh, tremble for your soul! For then you are still craving
   earthly honour; then you cannot believe and will perish. Then
   everything about you is still shell, still useless wild splendour, and
   the dew of the eternal morning does not yet adorn your face.

   And now, did you receive a Pentecost blessing? If so, then allow these
   fiery tongues to be seen on you and the image of heavenly glory envelop
   your face. That light is not harshly blinding, but soft; it does not
   flare, but feels congenial. To see those tongues of fire on each of us
   would constitute the most glorious witness to God's tender mercy. It
   would also represent a glorious precursor of dying in the glow of His
   glorious light, something like a transfiguration on your deathbed
   before you pass through the dark portal of death into the heavenly
   Jerusalem.

   Meditation 17*

   Too Much Wine

   Some... made fun of them and said,
   "They have had too much wine."
   Acts 2:13

   The deep fissure that entered human life already in Paradise can
   unfortunately not be healed as long as the Maranatha has not been
   fulfilled. Then, yes, when the Lord, who presently has His palace in
   Heaven and rules the world from there, returns on the clouds as the
   glorious King, and shows us His last act of grace by leaving Heaven and
   descend to this earth for the second time, then shall this terrible
   fissure come to its end, but not before that.

   Then Paradise returns, and more than Paradise! Then the angels will not
   only sing "Peace on earth" to us as a prayer and as the beginning of
   fulfillment, but then there will be eternal peace on earth, never again
   a disrupted peace. This will be an endless rule of tender love under
   the sovereignty of the Prince of Peace, the heavenly Solomon! All the
   earth one city of peace, one immeasurable Jerusalem!

   But we're not there yet. The time is not yet ripe. When people try to
   establish such a regime of peace at this point, then that fissure is
   not really healed so much as merely covered up. When people are fooled
   into imagining that this eternal peace on earth has already been found,
   then the Lord God metes out terrible punishment for pushing aside His
   ordinances. Such efforts are nothing but attempts to take the work of
   establishing peace out of the hands of the King of Glory and implies a
   declaration that the return of the Lord is not necessary. In the words
   of the Prophet Isaiah, "Lord, you establish peace for us; all that we
   have accomplished you have done for us" (Isaiah 26:12). This statement
   constitutes the prophetic song of praise with which the Church needs to
   await her Bridegroom. Woe unto us if we imagine that the establishment
   of this eternal peace requires anything less than His return on the
   clouds. That peace will not come before that!

   ================

   "Full of wine!" Do you hear in that burst of guffaw and mockery not a
   further tearing at that same fissure, but now on Pentecost?

   The languishing human heart thirsts for a new life dynamic. Everything
   in you seeks a stimulus that will deliver you from the tepid and tired
   feeling of depression. You feel tingling in your blood, but in reality
   there is nothing but arid inertia. That's why the human heart calls
   with a variety of voices for holier and higher zeal.

   But you see, in His grace, the Compassionate One has already supplied
   you with such stimulus and enthusiasm. Long ago, a liberated people
   already sang the song of the redeemed on the shores of the Red Sea
   jubilantly! Waves of praise escaped from emotions of overwhelming
   gratitude (Exodus 15). That song of praise at the Red Sea was the
   resounding praise that accompanied Israel on all its pathways. God's
   protection served as walls and ramparts to provide safety. The desert
   blossomed and roses spread their fragrance throughout the wilderness.

   However, after the Red Sea, the highest, the most important event still
   tarried. It also tarried after the Bethlehem manger. After all, the
   glory of the angel choir in the fields of Ephrata faded at Gethsemane
   and comparatively disappeared at Golgotha.

   But now with Pentecost it comes. Finally, finally the Spirit of the
   Father and of the Son Himself descends. Rich, mild and in an
   overwhelming cascade He flows out over the entire flock of the Lord.
   And now, there we have it, that most blessed stimulus. The most
   glorious dynamic has sprung into action in a language that spatters
   with fire and radiates a sparkling glow. There stand those Galilean
   fishermen, ready to proclaim the manifold praise of God in the
   Jerusalem temple! And what is the impression that most people in the
   city gain from this? Only that these Galileans had drunk too much
   strong wine! They are talking like drunks!

   This was sin against the Holy Spirit!

   ==================

   Appalling! And yet so natural! Think of it, that crowd in Jerusalem
   needed stimulus, animation and refreshment to overcome their tiredness
   just as much as you and, in fact, most people. That is the result of
   sin and thus holds true for everyone. But what is about the only thing
   that stimulates the people, whether in Jerusalem or in our own country?
   The answer is something that has always been there, is now and shall
   remain till the Lord's return, namely wine and strong drink.

   Wine has indeed the power of lifting up one's spirit. God created the
   grapevine. The purpose and effect of wine is indeed to strengthen
   depressed powers and to animate tired spirits. And so, it should not
   surprise us that this crowd in Jerusalem, that itself had never known
   any other kind of stimulation and had never seen people's mood elevated
   except through the effect of wine, would assume the same to be the case
   with the Apostles. Thus they called out, "You're drunk!"

   It is exactly this kind of reaction that reveals our deep sin and the
   depth to which we have sunk. Left to ourselves without higher light, we
   attribute the highest operation of the Spirit of grace to the operation
   of the spirit of satan! Only grace, divine mercy, protects us from such
   behavior.

   ==============

   That's the situation here. Wine can indeed strengthen and is a
   stimulant given by God (Proverbs 31:6) for the sad of heart, so that in
   his anguish he does not become prey to hopelessness. Nevertheless,
   there is also a devilish power that hides in wine. Wine has its
   boundaries. If you allow it to prickle you just enough for a moment, it
   will strengthen and animate you. But you go beyond that boundary just a
   bit and it won't take long before it de-animates instead of animating
   you, and will release the demon residing deep in your blood and spirit
   that was under restraint only by your self-consciousness. That is why
   all drinks that stimulate are extremely dangerous. These drinks, as
   long as you use them to warm and get yourself a lift, are a precious
   fire, but they can also singe and scald you and burn you with terrible
   wounds. They can destroy you as soon as you go just a little beyond the
   boundary.

   Drunkenness is from the devil; it is satan's satyr [1] that sneaks into
   the human soul and life. A person who is not animated, elevated and
   resounding with praise to the Lord, is poisoned in his innermost, made
   senseless and has become a slave to evil passion. That crowd in
   Jerusalem now equates that satanic, that terrible demonic that causes
   an explosion of evil within us, with the work of the Holy Spirit! Oh,
   what a sour and bitter fruit of evil!

   =============

   Marvelous! The human race is offered two stimulants. God created the
   grapevine to ease exhaustion of the body and, out of pure grace, gave
   us the Holy Spirit to relieve spiritual exhaustion and spiritual death.

   Our evil heart says, "The prickle of the wine is enough!" and lets it
   stimulate our soul through the blood. Thus both soul and body are
   poisoned. But the Spirit wants it the other way around. He offers you
   stimulation of the soul, lifts you up out of your spiritual exhaustion
   and enervates you spiritually, while He simultaneously enervates your
   weakened physical prowess and provides support for your whole being.

   But now these two work against each other. On the one side there is the
   unregenerate (not born again) world that seeks its excitement in the
   visible and can therefore not understand the Spirit. On the other side,
   there is the flock of the Lord that, saturated with the streams of the
   Spirit, despises those unholy stimulants. Thus, from both sides there
   arises tension between them, stronger stimulation, more powerful
   pushes, but both from completely opposite sources. That small flock
   animated by the Holy Spirit; that large crowd, by a torrent of
   indulgence and fun. They must collide. The only impression the world
   can leave with God's children is that everything in it is all about its
   state of drunken stupor. The same with God's child; as soon as he meets
   the world he can only leave them with the impression of being drunk.
   Hence their scornful, "You are full of wine!"

   Provided the child of God has an intimate relationship with Him, the
   above situation produces in the believer a terribly fearful feeling of
   tenderness and compassion, while the child of the world, when he meets
   a Christian, can only react with scornful laughter of mockery and
   contempt. You need to be able to bear that scorn and laughter. You may
   not try to avoid it by following a different route. You even need to
   desire that laughter for Jesus' sake. You must counter that scorn and
   laughter by calling out and announcing ever louder the great deeds of
   God.

   Meditation 18*

   The Comforter [1]

   I will ask the Father,
   and He will give you another
   advocate/comforter
   to help you and be with you forever.
   John 14:16

   And so our Pentecost came, the holy feast of the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit. Oh, whose soul is not lifted up from all the baseness and lack
   of holiness of our earthly existence at the hearing of those glorious
   sounds that there is a Holy Spirit that overcomes the unclean spirits?
   That Holy Spirit is not far from us, does not still have to be sent,
   but is Someone who has already been given to us. Now the Fountain of
   blessed comfort, brought to us by that Holy Spirit, flows generously.

   The broad population knows nothing about all this; the masses do not
   comprehend this rejoicing of the soul. Apart from His Name perhaps,
   they do not know the Holy Spirit. He is a stranger to them about whom
   they may have heard rumours as of a mysterious apparition. They may
   have heard many stories about Him but He has never penetrated their
   hearts. They may have heard of tongues of fire and of talking in
   different languages, but how can those who do not know Him be
   spellbound by these events and of whom these signs were witnesses?

   Therefore, the travelers along the broad road also celebrate Pentecost
   but without the Holy Spirit. It is more a celebration of spring and a
   matter of enjoying nature, a family day on which people visit relatives
   and friends or enjoy bonding with their children. [2] They are not
   particularly intent on desecrating the feast of the Holy Spirit; they
   simply ignore it.

   Oh, the Lord Jesus had so strongly warned about this Holy Spirit, "The
   world cannot accept Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him"
   (John 14:17). That Holy Spirit and the spirit of the world will remain
   at odds with each other till the end.

   But not everyone keeps following the ways of this world. Throughout the
   ages and even today there are those who have divorced this world, not
   with a haughty "Leave me, for I am holier than you," but because they
   have come to fear the world, fearful of her deadly influence, fearful
   of her terrible power of temptation. Such people have cast off the
   snares of this world as one shakes a poisonous viper from his hand.

   These are men and women who follow the path where once the holy
   Apostles trod and to whom Jesus had said, "But you know Him, for He
   lives with you and will be in you" (John 14:17). While they follow that
   narrow path, they are troubled that they may have escaped the world,
   but that they still carry it with them in their own heart. They are
   afraid and dispirited, because Jesus has said, "You will have the Holy
   Spirit in your heart," but when they pulled their hands away from their
   bosom, they were leprous (Exodus 4:6-7) and the smell of the death of
   the world clung to them. For, yes, that is the actual situation. There
   is not one broad way for godless sinners and then one narrow path taken
   by saints.

   No, no, whoever puts it that way is dreaming. For this is the fact of
   the matter, that thousands go in through the wide door, whose gracious
   adornments of the soul may sometimes make you jealous. On the other
   hand, there are also hundreds who go in through the narrow gate and who
   walk the right path, but who still carry the leaven of the world within
   themselves. This is what causes the oscillations, the fluctuations and
   the struggles in the life of the soul, for what will these men and
   women hold on to? If there is no benefit, why not return to the broad
   way? As his wife advised the suffering Job of ancient times, "Bless God
   and die!" (Job 2:9). [1]

   No, by all that is holy and as truly as God's Covenant is firmly
   established, they cannot do that, but they pursue another and better
   way. For hear! In the midst of their misery they jubilate in the
   presence of the Holy Spirit. Where all hopes appeared gone, they praise
   the divine Comforter.

   =============

   What does it mean that the Holy Spirit is a Comforter? Could it mean
   that the Holy Spirit heals the wounds of oursouls or lifts us up in our
   sadness, refreshes us in our mourning or upholds us during the bitter
   beatings of life? Certainly that is all included.

   There is nothing, absolutely nothing that can grieve our heart for
   which the Holy Spirit does not have sufficient rich treasure of
   comfort, so that whoever comes to Him will never be sent away with
   empty hands. And surely, when death enters our life and robs us of a
   loved one, then it is not the spirit of the world but definitely the
   Holy Spirit from above who will fill our disquieted heart with courage
   and hope. The Holy Spirit will lift us up into that higher life so that
   we who remain behind do not envy the glory of the friend taken up. The
   Spirit helps us live in the heavenly awareness that, even after our
   separation, the bond of fellowship remains and He sets our self-centred
   hearts straight by making it clear to us that even those most dear to
   us do not live for us, but that we together exist only for God.

   We must never entertain the slightest doubt that only by the Holy
   Spirit is the real divine balm of healing comfort prepared for the
   wounded heart. Whatever else we seek or recommend is a mere placebo
   that only serves to make us forget our suffering without healing it. If
   you do not want to follow that route but, instead, want to experience
   and accept whatever God lays on you, you want to empty the cup that God
   has prepared for you, sip by sip, and you submerge your head in the
   waves of misery till you have been through it all, by then you cannot
   manage without the Holy Spirit and you will be the first to be
   comforted by Him.

   =================

   And yet, that is not the real Pentecost and that is not real Pentecost
   praise! If that were the essential meaning of it all, then only those
   suffering deprivation would be the happiest of all and only mourners
   would be saved. This would amount to a Pentecost for defeated souls
   only.

   That is definitely not our Pentecost. It is for all God's children; for
   everyone who knows the Holy Spirit; for every generation. It is for
   those who first came to know the Father; thereafter, the Son; and only
   after that entered into the glorious knowledge of God the Holy Spirit.
   For--and this is a mystery of the Comforter--to be submerged by
   mourning because of hard knocks of misfortune or bitter mourning for
   the loss of a loved one, is not the worst.

   There is a wound that digs in much deeper and a suffering that is much
   more cancerous, for it devours our soul and brings on all God's
   onslaughts and the waves of the Almighty over us. That kind of
   suffering can come upon us even if all our children surround us with
   loving support and Heaven above is glorious and cloudless. Oh, the
   battle of the soul, the inner struggle of the spirit, that hovering
   between life and death, God and satan, heaven and hell! If that's truly
   where we find ourselves, so terribly exhausted and worn out, it casts
   the soul into a deep pit of defeat.

   If that's our situation, then deep within our soul there will be an
   invitation from God, the living God, to approach Him directly. But we
   cannot do so without the intervention of a miracle, the miracle of
   grace, mercy and of saving omnipotence. Think about how disheartening
   it would be, for you to suddenly stand before the portal of death in
   clear awareness of all the terror of your sins and your godlessness
   cast itself upon you, and just at that moment when you need Him the
   most, the Lord your God were banned from your soul because of your
   self-accusations. How you would helplessly and desperately shout, "God,
   have mercy on me, a sinner" (Luke 18:13).

   That is seldom what happens at the death of a Christian. First of all,
   in the hour of death your strength has diminished too much and your
   spirit is too faded to equip you for such a struggle. Secondly, it
   appears that the Lord God in His mercy prefers to spare us such deadly
   angst on our deathbeds.

   Even though such angst seldom attacks us while we are dying, it can
   attack us before dying. It can overtake us when the Lord God engages us
   in struggle and confronts us with judgement; when He makes us aware of
   the deep needs of our souls or shows us the image of His Son so
   that--oh, how cruel!--our own hearts must answer, "I have hardly
   reflected that image at all."

   Sometimes that struggle comes furiously, horribly, and overpoweringly;
   it is sometimes compressed into a single night or week. During such an
   intense time our entire life may fly past us in review, how God has
   gone with us through fire, storm and thunder and we finally implore Him
   like Jonah from out of the belly of the whale (Jonah 2).

   However, this is by no means always the case. Often the struggle is
   spread out over the entire life of God's children. There will be
   momentary breathers, but then they will again be submersed and their
   heads tossed about by seaweed and bulrushes.

   Of course, all this is about a spiritual existence that, you might say,
   cannot really be considered a life. Everything holy about God presents
   itself to the soul clearly and lucidly. There is no doubt about the way
   to follow: there, there I need to go. Neither is there any desire to
   wander away from God, but, rather, a strong urge to cleave to the
   living God. However, our goodness is not up to His standard and thus
   does not reach Him, while the heart, that should belong to Him and cast
   its hope on holiness, that poor weak heart is constantly struggling
   against evil intrusions, tormented by sinful thoughts, experiencing an
   abyss between God and praying lips. Then, when the soul asks itself,
   "What do I have that distinguishes me as a child of God?" it recognizes
   there is not even one grain of salt, not a single beam of light, not a
   stone of either a city or a mountain, except an occasional despairing
   call, "That millstone, Lord, is for me. Cast me with it into the depth
   of the ocean, for I have caused your little ones to stumble" (Luke
   17:2)!

   We hear much about suicide. It is said that many deep souls become
   insane. Well, yes, if there were no Pentecost and a child of God were
   being tossed to and fro for days or even years, then insanity may seem
   a natural result so that the victim hardly be held responsible. Without
   the Holy Spirit, a worm will enter to destroy the spirit; you will not
   find any happy child of God.

   But see, it is exactly at this point that the glory of the Comforter
   rises within us! We have the kind of wounds that need that Comforter
   and for which He has prepared the necessary balm. This is for the
   children of God who are torn in their innermost, for the upright of
   heart who leave no stone unturned in their struggle against
   unrighteousness, for the men and women for whom God and His
   righteousness are a central concern and have a sense of, "Oh, God, I am
   sinking!"

   With such people the work of this divine Comforter is glorious beyond
   words. He is the Holy Spirit, God almighty, God Himself. That unholy
   world lies within and around us, but the Spirit does not say, "I have
   no truck with that world or with that awful unholy heart." No, the Holy
   Spirit speaks to you from out of the depth of that unholy world and
   from the noisy pit of this unclean heart. He does not keep His distance
   but descended to this earth and there chose for Himself a circle of
   people and moved into their hearts as His Temple. Now He lives in that
   circle and is there, near to them, not far. He has been commissioned,
   poured out never to return to Heaven. Since Pentecost, never but never
   has the Church of Christ been without that Holy Spirit even for one
   moment.

   Oh, the Holy Spirit with us! That is all the comfort we need. That
   penetrating divine Spirit that uncovers all secrets, came to us and has
   never left us again. He stayed with us and when everything seemed to go
   wrong, that Spirit was right there at our side, never retreating but
   continually reassuring, " Do not despair; My hand holds you!"

   Is that not indescribably glorious? When you're on your sickbed,
   writhing in pain with the contagion of cancer consuming you, but that
   holy Angel, no, much more, that Holy Spirit stands by your bedside
   constantly, God Himself watching over you as your life fades away,
   moistening your dry lips as you were about to succumb in your sorrow.

   Just the knowledge that, in the midst of all this filth and impurity in
   my heart, the Holy Spirit never leaves me for a moment is a glorious
   experience! Just to know that, when everything around me is frozen and
   I myself am numb and petrified, the Spirit is constantly there with His
   glorious, warm and cherishing embrace, with His eye sparkling with the
   glow of love and His breath stirring life in my tightly squeezed
   breast!

   Don't you feel this consolation? Can you think of any richer, more
   glorious comfort? Is He not like your guide who walks along with you in
   the dark forest so full of murderous caves? As soon as you perceive His
   presence, doesn't your soul automatically revive and reach out for the
   holiness that is Him?

   ===============

   Even that is still not His comfort at its fullest. It isn't only that
   the Holy Spirit is near and around you, never leaves God's children,
   and feels anxious with you in all your anxieties and oppressed in all
   your oppressions. He does more: He not only comes near you, but in you
   and comforts you by making that wonderful faith flow in you. And what
   does it mean that the Holy Spirit dwells in you? This, that the Spirit
   shares your suffering and misery. He, the uber-rich par excellence,
   dwells in you, the pauper, and shares His wealth with you. Is that not
   real consolation?

   Imagine, if you will, a family in deep misery, without bread in the
   house, all clothing worn out and resentment, malice and iniquity given
   free reign. Now imagine that a millionaire stranger moves into their
   hovel with them. He has his chests and suitcases brought in and shares
   his wealth with the family. With much laughter, he spreads peace and
   happiness around. What do you think: would such a family not be
   comforted? Could you think of anything that would make the family in
   that hovel happier?

   Well, that is exactly what the Holy Spirit does for God's children. He
   knows you are desperately poor and does not pretend otherwise. He does
   not pretend you are well dressed, but acknowledges you in your
   nakedness. He does not consider you sparklingly clean but recognizes
   the festering boils in your heart. That uber-rich Holy Spirit, to whom
   all the treasures of Heaven belong, comes to dwell in you and becomes
   your fellow victim in misery. When the debt collector comes and you
   don't have the wherewithal to pay, He will pay. When it is time to eat
   but there is no bread, He will provide it. When you find yourself naked
   and ashamed, He will quietly come up behind you and cover you with His
   cloth, so that no one will ever see you in such shame again, even
   though you did not contribute a single stitch. Don't you think that a
   song of joy and praise would be sung in the house of God's Israel on
   that Pentecost? Would not a psalm of praise be raised to God for such
   exceptional goodness?

   Pentecost remains forever young and alert. We keep falling into slumber
   and forget in our sinful dreams that the Holy Spirit has come to live
   in us. But every time the bell tolls and our Pentecost is once again
   rung in, the dormant soul of God's child awakes and again feels the
   glorious touch of the Holy Spirit, who once again lays His hand on us
   with blessed benevolence and whispers to us in his heavenly voice, "Be
   comforted, you who are driven by the storm! See, I, the divine
   Comforter, am with you and dwell in you with all My divine treasures!"

   Meditation 19*

   The Anchor for the Soul

   We have this hope as an anchor
   for the soul, firm and secure.
   It enters the inner sanctuary
   behind the curtain.
   Hebrew 6:19

   Jesus ascended into Heaven, into that Heaven that, like the earth here
   below, was created and thus was not from eternity. It is, to be sure, a
   totally different creation sphere, but that nevertheless offers a realm
   of life and activity, of enjoyment and beauty, but in a much richer
   sense. It is not a vague entity, purely spiritual, but a rich and
   glorious reality. It is a world much more real than our world in which
   we currently live. It is a created place that has a foundation; our
   actual fatherland. It is that magnificent creation where all of God's
   good angels have their abode as well as those saved by the Lamb, the
   crowd that no one can count. This is the very goal of the existence of
   believers, their real home.

   The ascension of Jesus to Heaven does not imply that He withdrew from
   earth as God and suddenly jumped back to the throne of glory. That is
   not possible, because as God He is omnipresent. Such a God can withdraw
   His revelation or His countenance, but He cannot move from place to
   place.

   Hence it was not God as God who acted, but the Son of God, who as
   Mediator personally united with the man Christ Jesus. That's how the
   Ascension became possible. The man Jesus Christ, like all humans, is
   restricted and limited to one place. Thus, as a human being Jesus was
   not in Heaven when He was on earth. In fact, He had never been in
   Heaven prior to His life on earth. As human being He could not be on
   earth and in Heaven simultaneously; it was either one or the other. His
   Ascension story clearly tells us that the Mediator between God and
   people, the human person Jesus Christ, started His journey of
   suffering, the Via Dolorosa, in Jerusalem, and from there He moved on
   to the Mount of Olives. It was there at the top that He ascended
   through the atmosphere surrounding our globe, going higher and higher
   until He, constantly on the move from one place to another, finally
   arrived in that totally different part of creation called "Heaven."

   We do not know how one enters Heaven or where it begins. We do not know
   the measurable limits of the universe. It could be that the heavenly
   creation, with its totally different contents and proportions, intrudes
   or penetrates our creation sphere in similar fashion that Jesus in His
   state of glorification penetrated walls and locked doors. Nor do we
   have any clue as to the time it took the Lord Jesus to ascend to
   Heaven. However, people should avoid the notion that there was no time
   involved. The ten days between Ascension and Pentecost suggest the
   contrary. Moving from one place to another always takes time. In the
   world of space, astronomers tell us that one flash of lightning may
   take years to complete its journey out there. With that in mind, I
   repeat that no one knows whether or not the sphere of Heaven penetrates
   into the lower creation sphere. Secondly, the Scriptures repeatedly
   make mention of sudden movements much faster than we experience. Think
   of the movement of angels, of the fast travel of the Prophet Elijah
   when he ran ahead of King Ahab (I Kings 18:46; II Kings 2:11) or ran to
   Mount Horeb (I Kings 19:7-8) and of the Prophet Elisha when he was as
   it were carried to Samaria (2 Kings 6:20). The story of Jesus' sudden
   disappearance from the sight of the two disciples in Emmaus (Luke
   24:31) gives a similar impression as does that of Philip and the eunuch
   (Acts 8:39-40).

   With respect to all those events we have to keep ourselves to a minimum
   of details and explanations to avoid all spiritualization. We can only
   know the following for sure: that the restricted man Christ Jesus moved
   from place to place in normal restricted human fashion.

   We know that, during the transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-3; Mark 9:2-9;
   Luke 9:28-36), He had one moment and then a series of moments during
   his transfer to Heaven and finally a glorious moment during which He
   reached the actual Heaven, passed through its portals and now arrived
   in that Heaven where the man Christ Jesus had never been. There, in
   that totally different, richer, more glorious world He accepted that
   high position of governing that the Father had laid on Him.

   As to the circumstances in that Heaven, how the angels relate to the
   saved saints and the latter among each other or how they all connect
   with the man Christ Jesus, none of that is revealed to us. We do know
   certain things: Christ does not float or hover about in Heaven like a
   spirit, but He moves about as a human being with our flesh and blood
   and is never at more than one specific place at any given time. We also
   know that, if we were in Heaven now, we would indeed see Him there in a
   glorified state, but with a specific silhouette so that we would
   recognize the contours of His body.

   God's presence in Heaven is very different than it is on earth. The
   highest and most glorious Being is omnipresent. Thus He is at each
   point totally God. However, much of His creation acts like a veil that
   covers His countenance. His countenance is not revealed here but only
   in Heaven, for there that veil does not hide Him; there He reveals His
   presence in majestic details. This is the reason that, when we call
   upon God, we look up to Heaven. The Scriptures teach that we must not
   look for the throne of glory on earth but in Heaven. Seeing that the
   glory of the Highest Being is not revealed here but in Heaven, that the
   man Christ Jesus entered Heaven and received His power there, and that
   human Person has as substratum the eternal Son of God, the Scripture
   teaches that the man Jesus Christ is raised to the right hand of God
   and now lives with the Father in order to pray for us.

   In this new state of glory and majesty, the man Christ Jesus has been
   assigned sovereignty over His Church by God. Since that Church is
   unthinkable without the world and that world unthinkable without all of
   nature, Christ's sovereignty includes absolute power over all the
   rulers over the earth, over all peoples and nations as well as over all
   elements of nature.

   After the Ascension of Jesus Christ, God remains God. However, from
   that moment on a totally new circumstance was introduced, namely that
   God no longer rules everything directly, but through the mediation of
   the man Christ Jesus.

   This would not have been possible if the man Christ Jesus were not also
   Himself God. However large the terms in which we think of the power and
   speed of movement of the Human who lives in Heaven, that power never
   reaches omnipotence or that speed, omnipresence. And since the Church,
   the world and nature cannot be governed except with omnipotence and
   omnipresence, government over all these by the man Jesus Christ is
   unthinkable, unless the "divinity, majesty, grace and Spirit"
   (Heidelberg Catechism, question 48) can work through Him in a style
   that is marked by omnipotence and omnipresence.

   During His state of humiliation, the Mediator supported His humanity
   with His divinity, so that He was not defeated and lost. Similarly, the
   same Mediator, now ascended to and living in Heaven, again supports His
   humanity with His divinity, in order to carry out the highest regiment
   of government over the Church, and indirectly also over the world and
   nature, doing so in the Name of God and under His orders. That is what
   He said: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me"
   (Matthew 28:18).

   If you now understand clearly the significance of Jesus' Ascension to
   and entering Heaven, then you will also realize that with these new
   circumstances, the Church on earth had also to enter into a different
   situation from what she had experienced so far. The Church has been
   there ever since the beginning of the world, with Adam representing her
   in Paradise, then Adam, Eve and Abel and on down the generations.
   Throughout the ages during which God Almighty supported His people on
   earth by the Word of His power, He had His chosen ones. These chosen
   ones were not simply loose pearls strung together on a cord, but they
   belonged together by virtue of their mutual organic relationship in the
   Body of Christ. But, and this must be added immediately, that Church of
   the Old Covenant or Testament did not yet have the Mediator, the man
   Christ Jesus, who, later having entered into the innermost holy place
   of the Heavens, ruled her.

   The Ascension was an actual event. Before His Ascension, there was no
   human Christ Jesus up there in Heaven. The Old Covenant Church could
   never say what God's people confess now, namely that the human Christ
   Jesus lives in our flesh and blood in order to pray for and to govern
   us.

   We in no way deny here that the Son of God had a relationship with His
   Church since the beginning. If dates were recorded from eternity, we
   might say that that relationship can be traced back to the eternal
   council of God. In addition, we know that the Son of God, already
   during the Old Covenant, watched over His Church in a special way as an
   Angel of His Presence.

   But regardless of how highly we may rate that Old Covenant work of
   Christ, it was all provisional, preparatory, leading the way and
   intended to move up to empirical reality only in the fullness of time.
   That was the time after the Word had become flesh, the Golgotha phase
   had passed, the reconciling Mediator had ascended, and the man Christ
   Jesus sat at the right hand of the power of God in the Heavens.

   It was then, with the Ascension of Jesus, that the household of the
   Church suddenly was transformed. Now that the real "thing" had come,
   the shadow faded and disappeared. In the temple, the altar fires were
   extinguished, the lamp of the eternal light was blown out, the curtain
   was torn in two (Matthew 27:51; Mark 15:38) [1] and already the Roman
   legions were approaching to destroy city and temple according to God's
   plan. The Church no longer needs her earthly fulcrum, the visible
   Jerusalem, now that she has her firm and glorious foundation directly
   in Heaven in the person of her King and Mediator, the human Christ
   Jesus.

   While the small ship of the Church was anchored at the holy sanctuary
   of Zion during the past ages, that anchor has been lifted. She is now
   moored to a completely different anchor, that is to say, to the human
   Christ Jesus, who as the new anchor has been securely moored in the
   Heavens. This implies that the Church, that till then was pressed down
   in her earthly form with its national character, felt that oppressive
   form slide off her shoulders after Jesus' Ascension, whereupon she
   dropped her national character and became the Church of the world.

   In the past, the Church was on earth, merely looking out at Heaven from
   the outside, but now that her principal Person, her One and All, has
   entered Heaven, she herself has after a fashion also been carried
   there. Take the example of the royal court where the king resides, even
   though most of his hangers-on, while at the court, are still some
   distance from the king. So it is with the Church; Jesus is there, but
   most of His beloved are still on earth.

   The government of the Church has been transferred. It is no longer the
   earthly David who reigns (2 Samuel 2:4; 2 Samuel 5:3-5), but the
   heavenly "David." The Church has been morphed from an earthly to a
   heavenly Church, since its government has been transferred from the
   city near the Mount of Olives to the city in Heaven. From this it flows
   necessarily and directly that the working of the Holy Spirit in the
   Church is very different before and after Jesus' Ascension.

   When the Church did not yet have the human Jesus Christ as its Head and
   King in Heaven, the working of the Spirit was ad hoc, passing,
   temporary and without identifiable central focus. True, the Kabod, that
   is, the glory of the Lord, revealed itself above the atonement cover of
   the Ark (Leviticus 16:14). However, this shadowy splendor pointed to
   and derived its meaning from a better and more glorious future when the
   atonement cover would reside in the very heart of the real High Priest,
   Jesus Christ, while the Holy Spirit would find in Him, the centre and
   head of the Church, His most glorious Temple.

   The Jerusalem temple was nothing but an example or image of that better
   Temple. Thus, when that better Temple arose, the image imploded into
   ruins. From now on, the human Jesus Christ was the true, essential and
   always intended Temple that had finally come and opened up. Till
   Gethsemane and Golgotha that temple had hidden its beautiful treasures
   and ornaments in the pitch-dark of night, but now, through and by the
   Ascension of Jesus, the eternal light was lit in that Temple and all
   those treasures began to sparkle and glitter so bright, that all the
   angels were surprised and aghast.

   Christ is the Church. Now that Christ, the human Jesus Christ, had the
   Holy Spirit dwelling in Him and radiating out of Him, He could not at
   this stage of His glory arrive in Heaven and establish the intended
   relationship with His Church without at once having the Holy Spirit
   radiate and emanate from Him, never to separate from her again. Now
   that is what took place on Pentecost.

   This is what happened, when on the morning of Pentecost, sound and
   light broke into that upper room in Jerusalem (Acts 2:1-4). Having
   arrived in Heaven (Luke 24:50-51) and having the glory of the Holy
   Spirit ignited in Him as the Temple of God, the human Jesus Christ now
   entered into the normal relationship with His Church that had always
   been intended and was prophesied of old. He now elevated her out of her
   national, earthly and preparatory position into her heavenly place. He
   severed her from her earthly anchor and moored her to Himself as the
   heavenly anchor. From now on He would no longer approach her from the
   outside, but as a cascading stream working from within, He poured the
   Holy Spirit into the Church which then became the Spirit of life they
   shared, with Him as Head and they His members.

   sacrifices were carried out and worship according to the Law of Moses
   was followed faithfully. Hebrews 9:1-9 tells us that in the temple a
   veil separated the Holy of Holies--the earthly dwelling place of God's
   presence--from the rest of the temple where men dwelt. This signified
   that man was separated from God by sin (Isaiah 59:1-2). Only the high
   priest was permitted to pass beyond this veil once each year (Exodus
   30:10; Hebrews 9:7) to enter into God's presence for all of Israel and
   make atonement for their sins (Leviticus 16). Read more:

   Meditation 20*

   Clothed with Power from on High

   I am going to send you
   what My Father has promised;
   but stay in the city until
   you have been clothed
   with power from on high.
   Luke 24:49

   Jesus ascended into Heaven to inherit a Kingdom. The time that has
   elapsed since has not been one of rest but of struggle and war and
   victory. He has ascended the throne. The scepter of the Kingdom has
   been placed in His hand and He has magnificently ruled amid His enemies
   throughout these ages.

   He did not rule dressed in robes fashioned after earthly rule. Jesus
   said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, My servants would
   fight to prevent My arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now My kingdom is
   from another place" (John 18:36). No, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ does
   not come with the ostentation, the external glitter or facade of an
   earthly kingdom. His conquests are within you; the character of His
   triumph, spiritual. He does not operate by force of sword or fire or
   stake, but by bending one's consciousness and by transforming the
   heart.

   Oh, yes, the Kingdom of Jesus also has an external face, of course. But
   that external form is derived from that other part of creation that we
   know as Heaven, not from the lower part called earth or "the world." If
   only you could be transferred from here to the above and possessed
   organs capable of admiring the beauty and the radiance of what blazes
   in that unseen light. How amazed you would be at the heart-gripping
   impression of that heavenly external face of Jesus' Kingdom. You would
   kneel in worshipful ecstasy.

   The mightiest rulers on earth all have magnificent courts, where
   everything flaunts its splendour and displays its wealth of the most
   exquisite stonework.. However, all this magnificence and splendour is
   pale and lacklustre in contrast to the glory of Jesus sitting on His
   heavenly throne.

   The Apostle John saw something of all this on the island of Patmos and
   promptly fell as if dead at Jesus' feet because of this overwhelming
   light (Revelation 1:17). The Prophet Isaiah peeked at it when he
   witnessed the splendour of the Seraphs on the throne (Isaiah 6:1-5).
   The Apostle Paul caught a glimpse of it when he was breathing murderous
   threats on his Damascus Road (Acts 9:1-2). What kind of person, even if
   he felt only a shadow of such glory coming over him, would not be
   overcome by consternation and lose control over himself?

   Don't make a mistake. Up there in Heaven you will no longer find that
   Child "wrapped in cloths" (Luke 2:7, 12), or the Son of Man who has no
   place to lay His head (Matthew 8:20; Luke 9:58), or the Man of Sorrows
   resembling a bruised reed (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 12:20). To the
   contrary, there above He is the laurelled Conqueror, the King of glory,
   who has a crown of finest gold pressed on His head, the mighty Ruler
   who fills all the Heavens with His glory. And not only that. Outwardly,
   externally, that glory of Jesus' Kingdom is not only up there above,
   but it also descends down to this earth and one day, at the appropriate
   moment, the illustrious day will dawn when all rulers on earth will
   experience the power and force of this King of glory in a visible
   external way on earth. Leave them to their mockery; let them laughingly
   declare that they refuse to worry about the Lord and His Anointed. He,
   who sits on the throne, knows that the Lord has anointed His King over
   Zion and that one day all those Pagans will become His inheritance.

   Those who over-spiritualize things will see the truth. Their fanatic
   spiritualization will bring them in open conflict with the Holy
   Scriptures and lead them to deceive the people that things in heaven
   are already very different and that one day things on earth will also
   reveal themselves very differently. In this spiritual mysticism the
   external hardly counts so that everything withdraws itself into the
   internal. They forget that if everything were purely spiritual, there
   would be no need for anything physical: the physical incarnation,
   physical death, physical resurrection or even a visible sacrament. This
   puts us on the road to the antichrist, for, says the Apostle John, he
   is the antichrist who denies that Jesus came in the flesh (I John 2:22;
   4:3; II John 1:7).

   May the Church of God therefore free itself from this sinful one-sided
   imbalance and confess, as the Heidelberg Catechism does so gloriously,
   that there is but one comfort, one solace, one balm for soul and body,
   in death as well as in life. Let us also in Christ constantly have an
   appreciation for the full, rich and versatile glory; glory in the
   spirit, but also in the visible; your innermost, but also with your
   external face. All of this holds with the provision that this "external
   face" is for now only in Heaven, but destined to be revealed later here
   below in the resplendent regimen of the Anointed of the Lord.

   ============

   The life of God's children is not to be one monotonous continuum,
   plodding and struggling from one day to the next, one generation dying
   off as the next emerges, as if we can expect nothing but to
   meaninglessly spin out the thread of our lives and, at the end, to be
   taken up into some spiritual vacuum. By no means. Our motto, our
   struggle, our enthusiasm must have a goal, a prospect or vista, a solid
   hope and a firm expectation.

   Of course, we have to accept that the struggle may last long, even
   centuries perhaps, while in the meantime there must be much suffering
   of the saints before that great and illustrious day arrives. But no
   matter how excellent this suffering of the saints may be, it becomes
   unholy if it is separated from the glorious anticipation of Jesus'
   Kingdom. It would also become unholy if we were to think that we are
   presently, after all these centuries, on a sort of stagnant plateau,
   and that perhaps many centuries later our King, the Anointed of the
   Lord, will arise from His slumber in order to establish His Kingdom on
   earth.

   Israel's Watchman never slumbers nor sleeps (Psalm 121:4)!

   Now as well as throughout all these ages, it is one mighty work, one
   holy dynamic activity, one majestic continuous struggle, one restless
   pursuit towards that glorious goal. Put in other terms, it is a never
   ceasing victory, a steady triumph, a sure approach with certain steps
   day after day towards the intended goal. Not for one moment should we
   entertain the thought that the struggle of King Jesus for the further
   development of His Kingdom is ever suspended for even a minute. Our
   King never negotiates a truce with his enemy. Never does He pull back
   from the battlefield.

   Restlessly He pits His power against that of His adversaries. That's
   how it was when you were a child; so it is still today now that you are
   a mature adult; and so it will remain till your senior years. When you
   pass on to better regions, that struggle will continue over your grave.
   It will not end until He comes for whom all graves will unlock
   themselves. Thus all God's children are steadily involved in a battle
   and, while battling, they are constantly on the way to an abiding
   triumph and lasting victory. All their struggle is merely one mighty
   preparation for that one great future day, when the clouds shall break
   and the Kingdom of our King descend to earth.

   ============

   Thus a child of God here on earth may never think that the Kingdom of
   God has actually already arrived and that all we have above in Heaven
   is a shelter and protection of this earthly kingdom. To the contrary,
   he must live and struggle in the steadfast and living realization that
   he is not in his own country but in the Kingdom of God. At best, he has
   been sent to a distant dependency in order to fight and struggle for
   the honour of his King, constantly remembering that the triumph does
   not belong to that far island or that lonely and forsaken dependency,
   but that it will be celebrated in the true realm of the King--in the
   Heavens above.

   This should easily be understood, especially in countries with
   far-flung dependencies or colonies. Their citizens live in their own
   land along with their ruler, whether king, prime-minister or president.
   But far off somewhere, there are those dependencies, colonies or
   overseas possessions. Citizens of the metropolis go live and work in
   those distant places, not for themselves nor for that dependency; they
   go there to fulfill their national calling. Their orders and directions
   come from the metropolis; they send their tributes and profits back
   home. They live far away, but it is a life from and for the metropolis.
   Should the colony obtain its independence, the metropolis citizens will
   immediately return home. That is their country and that's where they
   belong.

   That's how it is with the children of God on earth with respect to
   their King, who is in Heaven. The Kingdom is with Him. From Him come
   the orders. They do not live for themselves nor for this earth.
   Everything comes from above and returns there. The land, the Kingdom
   for which they strive and struggle, is not for them on earth but above
   in the Heavens. Jesus does not exist for the world, but all the world
   exists for Him. That's why Pentecost follows on the heels of the Lord's
   Ascension.

   =============

   He ascended to inherit a Kingdom, but He had hardly ascended the throne
   when an amazing miracle occurred through which He made His reign on
   earth invincible with one stroke and prepared for His assured triumph
   on that great and illustrious day. If He is the substantive and real
   King on the throne up there above and (1) His Church on earth must
   battle for Him and (2) He must be revealed there as the victorious King
   on earth, then there has to be community and commonality between this
   King and His redeemed here below. The battle for His Kingdom on earth
   and the triumph of that Kingdom in the Heavens cannot be a mere figment
   of the imagination. It cannot exist only in theory or amount to mere
   pondering or dreamed-up invention. It must be real; it must actually
   exist in power.

   Now, that's what it finally became through the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit. That outpouring is not a mere enlargement or permutation in the
   world of spirits. No, it is a sudden invasive invasion into the human
   heart by the power from on high, of such a power that outrivals all
   other powers with irresistible force. Our King Himself said to His
   disciples before He ascended to His throne that they would be clothed
   "with power from on high" (Luke 24:49).

   Every battle is a struggle between opposing powers. Therefore, over
   against His honour and glory, the world combines all of her forces in
   order, if at all possible, to resist the victory of our King. Of
   course, our King has to counter that extremely great power of the world
   with an even stronger force.

   As the world derives her power from her kingdom, so must our King
   derive His power and make it effective from His kingdom. For the world
   it is a matter of having her supporters and faithful empowered out of
   the depth, but for our King, those He redeemed and purchased are
   empowered from on high. His power thus came and comes from on high.
   From that realm "on high" emerged a real and effective power, a power
   that neither fights with a sword nor uses physical violence to restrain
   the spirits, but one that penetrates into the deepest pores of the
   human soul. From there it influences the innermost of his
   consciousness, from that consciousness his life, his muscles, and
   everything he accomplishes.

   This is not a power from the outside to the inside, but the reverse,
   from the inside to the outside! It is for that reason that it is an
   irresistible and all-victorious power. After all, it is the power of
   the Holy Spirit, the One which the entire Church worships and Who,
   together with the Father and the Son, comprises the only and majestic
   God, Who is worthy to be praised throughout eternity!

   Pentecost is thus the flowing of the power of the Lord of Lords into
   the world of human hearts in order to gain the victory and to rule
   first those hearts and, through the hearts, gradually the world. This
   is not a temporary sensation of higher power. No, the rule of King
   Jesus in that world of human hearts continues restlessly without ever
   ceasing. Ever since that great Pentecost day, that power of the Holy
   Spirit has never ever been lacking in either our human lives or in that
   of the Church of Christ.

   That which was once poured out, stayed and shall stay; it is
   inseparably tied to the Lord's Church. Even in times when the glow of
   the gold seemed obscured and people were under the delusion that the
   entire Church was destroyed, on hindsight it was clear that it never
   ceased its work, perhaps not above ground, but certainly at least
   underground. This is a forever advancing triumph of our King in the
   hearts of the children of mankind.

   ============

   Do remember: All this does not depend on massive crowds of people. The
   power and glory of our King would not diminish one bit, even if He had
   in this entire world rescued only one single human heart from death,
   turned him towards Him and won him for eternity as the gem of choice in
   His crown. The multiplication of restored hearts is, of course,
   glorious, but it remains multiplication. Jesus' real glory lies in the
   essence of His victory and reign, not in the continuous increase of His
   subjects.

   All human power on earth combined has constantly proved itself
   powerless to affect root change in the heart of even one single person
   that resisted it. All tyrannic and despotic violence, even in its most
   cruel format, proved completely helpless over against the tough
   resistance of even one single human will. It is only that unique "power
   from on high" dating from Pentecost, with which our King has succeeded
   for many centuries. That continues and will continue to turn even the
   most fanatic opponent into His bosom friend, turn the Sauls into Pauls
   (Acts 12:9), thistles into a myrtle trees (Isaiah 41:19, 55:13),
   eventually to establish for Himself a permanent and imperishable sign
   and established monument in human hearts.

   The dynamic of "being clothed with power from on high" continues to
   operate till this day. The decisive question for our lives is one of
   two things. Whether the main direction of the labour of our souls and
   our struggles is in sync with that power and in line with the channel
   it follows or whether we fortify ourselves against God with power from
   the depth of our own hearts, obstructing the progress of the flow of
   the Spirit whether consciously or subconsciously. For whoever follows
   the flow of that river there is a Pentecost in that life. That life
   becomes one continuous pilgrimage from his Pentecost to his eternal
   Paradise. Whoever is not carried along by this flowing river or does
   not bow before our King, goes upstream against that power and will one
   day, as sure as the irresistibility of that power, be sucked under by
   this river.

   =============

   Ah, "being clothed with power from on high" has such deep meaning.

   Negatively, the mark and sign that the King up there above has pointed
   His scepter to you and shown you His favour is not merely being
   "clothed from on high" or a purely emotional experience. To be sure,
   our feelings must not be allowed to petrify or be blunted. Neither may
   we despise the blessedness of an emotional life in the love of God.
   Nevertheless, though such an experience is indeed the effect of being
   so "clothed," it is not that operation itself.

   More positively, "being clothed with power" constitutes an escape from
   your spineless, tepid, mindless dullness. It does away with limp hands
   and languid knees, but puts power into those hands and energizes those
   knees. It once again animates the blood and creates a blessed glow in
   the arteries of our souls. Yes, clothed "with power!" There is no more
   the fearful shaking reed every time satan lurks around the corner or
   sin tempts you even before you are actually assailed. It is to be
   clothed with power to ward off, to resist, to battle and to overcome in
   the Name of your God.

   If there is need to render help to someone, being clothed with power
   will prevent you from shirking your responsibility and thinking that
   others will jump into the fray, since your strength will accomplish
   nothing and you are helpless in your languor. No! You have been
   "clothed with power from on high" in order to step in and to generously
   give assistance, to lovingly offer support and to compassionately apply
   a dedicated heart.

   "Clothed with power from on high" has as its goal for you to reach out
   beyond yourself in the Name of God in any number of situations. Where
   you used to keep quiet, now you can speak up. Where previously there
   was no prayer, now you lead in prayer. In short, "clothed with power
   from on high" means that the crippled now jump like deer and the dumb
   sing of the mercies of the God of Jacob. All of that is the operation
   of the Holy Spirit, who therefore is our soul-refreshing Comforter, for
   He comes into our hearts as a messenger from the King and pours our
   hearts full with fresh vigour and oil till they overflow.

   In all of this the wonderful mystery is that He does two seemingly
   opposite things simultaneously. He girds the weak with glorious power,
   while at the same time turning this new powerful hero into a small
   child before his Lord and King.

   Abba, our Father who is in Heaven!

   Meditation 21*

   Receive the Holy Spirit

   He may strengthen you
   with power through His Spirit
   in your inner being.
   Ephesians 3:16

   Pentecost draws and compels every soul that loves God, to bring praise,
   honour and worship to the Holy Spirit; to Him who teaches, leads and
   comforts us; to Him who prays in, with and for us with unutterable
   sighs; who with the Father and the Son is eternal and veritable God to
   be praised in all eternity. This is the One through whom He reveals the
   gifts of life and of reconciliation to us, who regenerates
   ("re-births") us and glorifies the Son in us. He is our Re-Creator
   because He is our Saviour, who quickens our despondent spirit. He is
   the Power of the power of all believers, our inner Light that dispels
   our internal darkness. As Immanuel is "God with us," so the Holy Spirit
   is "God in us." We are His temple and He makes our hearts His dwelling
   place!

   What benefit does the sun bring you, when the moon inserts itself in
   between, intercepts the light and prevents it from reaching you?
   Similarly, how would your Christ, the Sun of your righteousness,
   benefit and refresh you, if the light of the Sun, which in this context
   is the Holy Spirit, could not penetrate you?

   Therefore, no, we do not separate the Father from the Son nor the Son
   from the Holy Spirit. But does that not allow us to declare or confess
   that it is first the Spirit through whom all the love of the Father and
   the reconciliation of the Son becomes a personal soul experience for
   us? Or, should we ever taste the most blessed fellowship with the
   Eternal Being, would it not be God the Holy Spirit who would induce
   that joy into our bosom and make that blessed experience real?

   This arrangement neither places the Father behind the Son nor in the
   shadow of His glory, for the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and
   Son. Furthermore, that Spirit, proceeding from both, never points to
   Himself but always glorifies both Father and Son. That is the reason
   the Holy Spirit is not so dominant in your spiritual life. He is the
   light that illuminates everything and without which everything would
   lose its beauty, but that Himself remains unseen and imperceptible.

   The Spirit never comes out in the open, never displays Himself, is
   never pretentious, but is the constantly serving and supporting
   personal divine love beneath all the movements in the soul. Wherever He
   is, there is light shed on the indescribable compassion of the Father
   as well as on the unsearchable riches of salvation and redemption that
   lie hidden in the Son. The Holy Spirit in you rejoices when the light
   displays that compassion and those riches, or when He focuses your eye
   on that and keeps it there. He rejoices when He can create in your soul
   awareness, feeling and passion for all that, and when your soul opens
   up to drink the dew of heaven along with the radiance of His eternal
   love.

   Because of all of this, it cannot be otherwise but that it takes a long
   time before love for the Holy Spirit begins to burn in your soul, for
   all His works go unnoticed. He tends to timidly withdraw Himself so
   that you really have to actively pay attention in order to detect Him.
   And then, it sometimes joyfully happens through that unnoticed work
   that you experience your bonds to the Father and the Son. Ah, then that
   tender compassion of the Father and that total self-sacrificial love of
   the Son easily fill you with such a strong tension that you neglect to
   ask who it is that prepared this inner joy in you, or who made it
   possible and who bestowed it.

   The child of the Kingdom arrives at a later stage and along a different
   route.

   My brother and sister, allow me to tell you of that route of the
   Pentecost of the Lord. You see, that quiet, hidden operation of the
   Holy Spirit serves not only to show you the glory of the Father and the
   beauty of His dear Son, but He also has another function, a sad and
   almost ignominious one. The Holy Spirit must also lead you to
   self-discovery by letting its clear and irresistible light fall on what
   lies in your heart, on what your soul hides, on what contaminates your
   journey among men and what it is in the course of your soul that
   dishonours you in the eyes of God.

   Sometimes the Spirit will be cruel towards you, precisely to lead you
   to the mercies of the Father. He spares you nothing. He brings out of
   your hiding places everything, everything that you have ever been,
   thought or did and what you had so eagerly hidden, burrowed and made
   invisible. He puts it all in the light of the divine countenance. Yes,
   the Holy Spirit dares to be cruel in order for you to open your heart
   to the soft tenderness of the Son. For example, when you lived in deep
   pretence before your child and were satisfied you had covered yourself
   with a beautiful varnish; that is when the Holy Spirit exposed your
   most horrible iniquity in all its depth to your child.

   At first, this turns you off. Ah, we think, the Father in Heaven is
   sweet and loving to the heart. In order to love us with His unutterable
   love, there is His eternal Son.... But, why in addition that Holy
   Spirit, who is so near us but spares us nothing? Why does He always dig
   deeper and deeper into our souls and, like a highway robber, rob us of
   our false peace to leave us with such inner disquiet? That's when we
   have moments when we wish the Holy Spirit away; if only He were not
   there! This is a terrible thought that is almost never expressed but
   nearly always experienced in the spiritual struggles of the righteous.
   Experienced, yes, but also resisted, banned and regretted with hot
   tears of repentance and the terrible failure to recognize the most
   tender form of divine love that expresses itself precisely in that act
   of cruelty on the part of the Holy Spirit.

   Do not forget: the Father and the Son also love the Holy Spirit and
   want nothing to do with your worship and praise as long as you fail to
   recognize the Spirit and ignore Him. And so it happens that this higher
   and holier love makes you tender and renders you truly conscious that
   all this harshness, all these penetrating and apparent cruelties of the
   Holy Spirit are at their core nothing but precious demonstrations of
   deep divine mercy.

   But this is no more than a beginning, for the struggle of the Holy
   Spirit with your spirit has not yet reached its end: This is actually
   where the true spiritual struggle begins, even though on a wholly other
   terrain, involving much more anxiety, in a much more fearful
   relationship and in a manner directly opposite to its first beginning.
   The first was an inner pressure and squeeze exerted by the Holy Spirit
   to convince you of your sin and lead you to reconciliation, God the
   Holy Spirit Himself pleading with you, "Be reconciled to God!"

   But now things become very different. Praise the Spirit, you have now
   been convicted of sin and have drunk from the fountain of salvation
   that has opened the House of David in the struggle against sin and
   unrighteousness. You drank and you gained power! Oh, how gloriously did
   your soul revive under the lilies of eternal love. At this stage, you
   naturally expected that the Holy Spirit would praise and encourage you
   and withdraw from that sharp unsparing spiritual criticism.

   How disappointed you were. The same Holy Spirit continued with that
   same apparent cruelty and lack of compassion to disparage all your good
   works and to dismiss with strong disapproval the beautiful robe you
   have been given with a contemptuous, "Nothing but a castaway!" You did
   not understand this; you could not bear it; it was too much for you.
   You felt entitled to some benefit. After all, you had forsaken the
   world and confessed your sins. You strove with holy zeal and excelled
   in bearing fruit and doing good works for your Lord. Then to find out
   that all of this is still besmirched by sin and violence from an
   unclean fountain! Now you understood Israel's lament, "Let us return to
   Egypt!" You nearly gave up on your pilgrimage to the holy land of
   Canaan (Numbers 14:1-4).

   Truth be told, you would already have given up and either returned to
   or died in the wilderness where Israel wandered for forty years (Exodus
   16:35; Numbers 32:13; Deuteronomy 8:2), were it not that that faithful,
   loving Holy Spirit, who never gives up on you during such dark nights
   of the soul. He went before you like a pillar of fire (Exodus 13:21).

   And then what happened? Then you said to the Holy Spirit, "Then I can
   do nothing, not love, not work, not pray, not even sigh! If all of that
   is contaminated with sin, then there is no hope for me in eternity!"
   Then you expected that the Holy Spirit would comfort you by assuring
   you, "It's not that bad with you. You can do some things." That was not
   the answer. Instead, "Yes, that's how it is with you, child of the
   Father and redeemed of the Son, you are wholly incapable; nothing good
   comes from you. But listen well and experience now that deep divine
   mystery, that mystery of godliness that you can finally experience only
   now. For this purpose have I, your God the Holy Spirit, been sent in
   order to make all of this effective in you eternally and completely; so
   to work that you will drink in all the blessedness as if it were your
   work, even though it was I who did this in and through you, to deprive
   you eternally from all self-congratulations, which has been the bane of
   your soul!"

   This is where it all begins with that intimate exchange of the soul
   with the Holy Spirit, so that the child of God gives praise to the
   Spirit saying, "You, the Spirit of God, did and does it all in me." The
   Spirit responds by withdrawing Himself quietly and impressing on the
   soul a consciousness of a blessed awareness of a glorious spiritual
   power and display of spiritual dynamics. At that point, we ourselves no
   longer pray, but the Holy Spirit prays in us and we follow Him, so that
   there is an echo on our lips of what the Spirit has pleaded in us. Now
   we can no longer practice self-love, but the Spirit pours out His love
   into our hearts, so that we grow tenderly warm internally and can no
   longer be indifferent or cold. We are now consumed with affection for
   all the people of the Lord. By now we know nothing of Jesus on our own,
   but the Holy Spirit within us praises the love of our Saviour so
   gloriously that affection for the Lord and King burns within us. And
   then the Holy Spirit becomes so indescribably gentle, compassionate and
   attentive that our soul says to itself, "How can it be that I could
   regard the Spirit for so long as unloving and even unmerciful? There is
   no mercy more tender than His!"

   By now you will have no more sorrow, for the Spirit has already
   anticipated it long before and unnoticeably prepared and administered
   the medicine that would comfort that sorrow in you. You will never face
   a temptation or the Spirit has already anticipated that long since,
   knowing that your faith had to go through the crucible, but that you
   would not resist it so that you would be terribly distressed. Like a
   mother cares for her slumbering child, so the Spirit will strengthen
   your spirit with powers and command His angels to ensure no stone would
   bump against you (Luke 4:10-11).

   Ach, where should we begin or where end if we were to mention all the
   ways in which the Spirit displays His tenderness? Only those who have
   experienced it know that love. Only the wedding guests glow from the
   radiance of that soft, tender, beneficent light. That is the reason
   they love the Holy Spirit; therefore they yearn for the fellowship and
   the operation of the Spirit; and therefore is their Pentecost blessed.
   Blessed not because finally a church was established, for that had been
   there since the beginning of the world. Nor because the Apostles had
   been converted at this time.... No, but they are blessed, because on
   Pentecost the Spirit once again brings home into their hearts His
   glorious, tender, self-denying and wakeful love, calls them and assures
   them that it is not a matter of His still being on the way, but that He
   is already there. He is in the Church of the living God and both can
   and shall bless you with inner solace within the bonds of the Covenant
   of Grace.

   Do not lose yourself in ambitions and ideologies, but open your eyes to
   reality. What do you see and find there? This, that even God's most
   favourite children, even the greatest saints in this life, again and
   again wander away from the Holy Spirit and thus sadly fall apart
   without comfort or consolation. Then, in their foolishness, they think,
   "The Holy Spirit has departed from me." They complain in their
   faithlessness, "Who will lead me to a safe city?" In their exhaustion
   they conclude that it has all been nothing but a dream!

   That is why our Pentecost is a message of quiet and blessed
   consolation, because at that time God's Holy Word comes to their souls
   with power to testify, "No, the Holy Spirit has not departed. He has
   been poured out. He lives in the Church of the Lord!"

   This is the truth, that you, having saddened the Holy Spirit, feared
   within yourself, "Now the Spirit will no longer bestow His love on me"
   and that, punishing you for thinking His love, compassion and mercy to
   be so limited, He meets you with even greater divine compassion,
   saying,

   I was not surprised at the sadness you caused Me. I know you. I know
   what kind of creature you are; I will never ever give up on you. See,
   here I am, your God and the Restorer of your soul. Drink in the light;
   drink in the power; drink in the hope from my consoling Face!

   Meditation 22*

   Love in Our Hearts Poured out by the Holy Spirit

   And hope does not put us to shame,
   because God's love has been poured out
   into our hearts through the Holy Spirit,
   who has been given to us.
   Romans 5:5

   Together with the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit is the true and
   eternal God. Actual God. Not a third part of the divine Being or a part
   that belongs to that Being. No, that one highest Being is
   simultaneously Father, simultaneously Son and simultaneously Holy
   Spirit. Each of the three Persons has the same Being and together they
   are of one substance. God the Holy Spirit is therefore also the
   omnipresent God. He is not a God from afar, but near by, close to each
   one of us. It can never be said that the Holy Spirit is here but not
   there; He is everywhere and everywhere in His totality. God the Holy
   Spirit is even in hell, where He is as a consuming fire, a terror in
   the conscience of the damned.

   Even if the Spirit is always everywhere, He by no means uncovers
   Himself, reveals or displays Himself in every place or at all times. He
   can be and is there in such a way that we do not always hear his
   footsteps, that His face is veiled for us, that we do not listen to His
   voice. In effect, where this is the case, it is as if He were not
   there. But, after you have sinned, the pressure of an Accuser, who does
   not allow you rest, suddenly surprises you in your inner being. That
   does not mean that Accuser was not there before. No, He was there all
   the time but hidden to you. That Accuser was the Holy Spirit. The Holy
   Spirit uncovers His formidable face here for a moment and then once
   again goes into hiding, according to the character of the person for
   whom He uncovers Himself, judging at one time, comforting the next.

   He is always the same God the Holy Spirit, who with the Father and the
   Son is one unique, eternal and true God, but sometimes He hides Himself
   behind a thick veil, sometimes behind a more transparent one. At other
   times He uncovers His entire face, His glorious and comforting face.

   For that reason the Scripture teaches and the Church of Christ knows
   from experience that there are souls who have never noticed anything of
   the Holy Spirit and those to whom the Spirit has revealed Himself. Even
   blessed believers have times and moments during which they miss the
   Spirit and other times and moments when they possess the Spirit in
   ecstatic blessedness.

   When the Holy Spirit uncovers Himself to an unbeliever, he will see a
   "consuming fire," avoids it and slouches away. That is the Holy Spirit
   without the Mediator!

   Should it please God to cause someone to be born again through faith,
   then that person will also get to see the Holy Spirit, but as the
   Comforter, gentle, loving, teaching and anointing the soul. That is the
   Spirit poured out by the Mediator, reconciling, and indescribably
   refreshing and bountiful. The heavy fog is swept away by mercies. Thus
   the eye of the soul now sees the same Holy Spirit whom it did not see
   previously. While previously alone, that soul now has God in the
   innermost room of the heart.

   Sometimes the Holy Spirit uncovers Himself to the unconverted without
   the latter being born again. We don't question why that should be, but
   the Bible so teaches in Hebrew 6. Not a few people have memories dating
   from before their real conversion about experiences of seeing lights of
   phantom conversions. However, such an experience is wholly different
   from the operation of the Holy Spirit in genuine second births. Only a
   tip of the veil is lifted for just a moment, only to fall back into its
   normal position.

   However, with genuine second births, the veil totally falls away so
   that the view of the Spirit hits and falls upon us. This amounts to His
   being poured out in us; His indwelling in His temple; His coming into
   us, living, praying, comforting and motivating. Even among those born
   again, the eye of the soul can at times close again either partly or
   fully so that it can no longer see the Spirit (clearly), but in such
   cases the consoling face retains His presence; the Holy Spirit does not
   withdraw.

   ==========

   What is then the full blessing in that consoling and comforting
   presence? It is this, brother or sister, that in, with and through the
   Holy Spirit the love of God is poured out into your hearts. The holy
   Apostle Paul testifies to this, and to that witness the Church of
   Christ responds with an "Amen," that also is echoed in your soul.

   Understand well that this is not that lukewarm, tepid, diluted
   explanation that reduces the Spirit to a mere heightened awareness so
   that its beneficiaries now instinctively practice love as God is love.
   It's nothing like that. This love of God is the tender, divine,
   merciful love of the Highest Being towards us that, like a river
   revives the shriveled pasture and refreshes the thirsty garden of our
   souls through the streaming in of a cavalcade of the Holy Spirit.

   You do not have love in you; your heart is devoid of it. Whatever may
   look like love within you is one of three forms. It could be that
   instinctive love of a mother hen towards her chicks, but that has no
   value with God. It could be a display of love that suddenly shrivels up
   when it becomes a threat to your ego. It could also be the only true
   form of love that has been created in your loveless heart by a Higher
   Force, a nurturing that penetrated your cold spirit from the outside, a
   holy spark in your heart, a splash from the blaze of eternal
   tenderness. By nature your heart does not believe in God's love.
   Measuring Him by your own yardstick, you think of the Eternal as cold
   and without passion. Oh, yes, you say, "God is love. He, the Father of
   all forgives all." But that is mere idle talk, superficial chitchat
   without root or fiber. Meet up with distress--you're hungry without
   food; your favourite person has been cut off from your heart; your
   honour is under attack--and you will see what remains of God's love.

   That contemptuous fencing with beautiful sounds about God is deeply
   offensive. What has anyone who speaks in this manner of forgiveness,
   ever, ever experienced of that horrendous guilt for which he himself
   personally needed to receive forgiveness? All this is empty,
   meaningless gibberish. Being cold yourself, you thought of your God as
   equally cold, carefully measuring and reasoning things out as you do in
   your own cumbrous, matted soul.

   But, then, suddenly a fire shot into your bones and your marrow writhed
   within you. God struck you down as you felt your unrighteousness
   cascading over your head. Then, yes, then you suddenly discovered your
   God, as your illusions fell away and the real God appeared before you,
   a totally consuming Fire! That's when finally, finally the Holy Spirit
   forced Himself into your heart and came to dwell in its inner chamber.
   From there He addressed you with words of unspeakable blessedness,
   while you suddenly came to understand all that inexpressible tenderness
   of the consoling face of your God. That's when love came, the love of
   God, that warm, glorious glow of living love of the loving life. It was
   all food and drink at the same time, complete nourishment for your
   soul. That love of God was inexpressible; it was something
   indescribably glorious, like an inflow of a stream of many waters, in
   which each individual drop expanded into a full ocean of riches and
   blessings.

   Oh, the Holy Spirit is God Himself. He does not blend Himself with you,
   but all that you feel and realize in your innermost being, is what He
   makes you, as it were, co-feel and co-realize concurrently with Him.
   Along with that come the divine joys and blessings He Himself relishes
   and experiences, now that that holy peace has descended into your
   terrorized heart and God Eternal has flooded you with His divine
   mercies. That, that is what the holy Apostle of the Lord experienced
   when he wrote, "God's love has been poured out into our hearts through
   the Holy Spirit," to which he added, "who has been given to us" (Romans
   5:5). Everything is freely given us. The Holy Spirit is given us out of
   pure grace, with the result being a mandatory and eternal gratitude
   laid upon all of God's chosen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Meditation 23*

   The Spirit Gives Life

   The Spirit gives life;
   the flesh counts for nothing.
   John 6:5

   A tree with its marrow dried up is dead. The trunk may still stand, the
   dry branches still hanging and the pale leaves still clinging, but the
   tree is dead. It is no longer a tree, but only wood, wood that is most
   likely of no use for the planer anymore but only for the furnace.
   Without its marrow, the tree is gone.

   Do you understand this parable of the dead tree? The living marrow is
   God's Holy Spirit. Wherever the Holy Spirit withdraws from the leaves
   or twigs, from the branches or stems, from the trunk or roots, there
   remains nothing but barrenness, mould and death.

   In the spiritual sense of the word, this world in and by itself is
   nothing but dead. Everything is dead with nothing excluded. It is only
   insofar as the Spirit invades that death and inspires new life, that
   life emerges and remains. It isn't that there is life but it has
   shriveled and that the Holy Spirit irrigates it and thus enables it to
   refresh itself and raise its head again. No, at first there is no life;
   there is nothing but absence of, lack of and want of life. There are
   only some indications that there should actually be life, but in its
   place we find mere lifeless, soulless and powerless death. In the midst
   of this, the Prophet testifies, "Come, breath, from the four winds and
   breathe into these slain, that they may live" (Ezekiel 37:9).

   =============

   And see, it happens according to the prophecy. The Spirit blows, the
   Spirit comes, the Spirit works. Where He comes, there is life; where He
   has not yet come, death remains. Also death returns, when the Spirit
   came but was grieved and withdrew again. My brother, my sister, imprint
   it deeply inside of you: It is the Spirit, only the Spirit, and no one
   or nothing else than the Spirit that creates life.

   A church from which the Spirit has withdrawn is dead; it is nothing but
   a dried up tree trunk and will be cast into the fire. A generation, a
   clan, a family from which the Spirit has withdrawn sinks into spiritual
   death and breaks up. As with a dried up tree, so also does the brittle
   wood of a dead generation crumble at the first touch. Similarly--and
   pay special attention here--, when the Spirit withdraws from any circle
   of pious worshippers, including each pious member thereof, then that
   circle dies and turns into bait for the devils. It will not take long
   for such a heart to reveal that it did for a time know a degree of
   external grace, but that in its essence it really is still dry and
   without the life-giving sap. It still does not live, but remains dead
   and is headed for the fire--unless it revives and comes to life. All
   life is from the Holy Spirit.

   Think of it. If the Holy Spirit had not been at work and there had been
   no law, word or prophecy in Israel; if no wrestler had ever fought, no
   zealot ever striven, no martyr would ever have had the courage to
   sacrifice his life. Without the Holy Spirit not a single soul would
   ever have come to life, no church ever founded, no preaching of the
   Word ever heard, no power resisting evil ever risen, no lie ever
   unmasked, no innocence ever established, no proud heart ever softened
   and not one single blessed and refreshing prayer, cry or sigh ever
   ascended to the throne!

   ==============

   When God Almighty looks down out of Heaven upon this earth, He mostly
   sees a world caught up in death and curse. But His holy eye will also
   discover many positives that are loving and commendable, praiseworthy
   virtues, expressions of compassion, long-suffering or mercy. Yes, but
   realize that in whatever form or shape these appear, whether sighs of
   relief arising from this world, or scenes of love that rise to the
   throne on high, it is only the Holy Spirit who has established these.
   It is the Spirit that got them going, kept them going, kept animating
   them and, finally, the Spirit who brought their expression before God.
   The Church of Christ as well as our own hearts is indebted to the Holy
   Spirit for everything, everything that is in the world.

   To the extent that the Holy Spirit withdraws even for a brief moment
   from us, spiritual winter sets in over us, the cold slides over our
   hearts and then covers our souls as with ice, while the stream of life
   is blocked and death lurks just around the corner.

   However, when the Spirit returns and once again sends us His beams of
   light, it becomes summer again in the soul: The icy bottom of our human
   emotions melts, the heart is once again nurtured, the sounds of the
   pitter-patter of life revive, and the precious blossoming fruit in the
   field refreshes the eye of the soul.

   Ah, if only the world understood its real condition, it would do only
   one thing: Without ceasing, it would call upon and plead for the Spirit
   to enter its bosom.

   Ah, if only the churches of Christ on earth had any insight into their
   real import, banning all other considerations, how they would call upon
   and plead for the Spirit to protect the arteries of the organism
   without ceasing.

   Ah, if only our generations and families would realize what it is that
   keeps them together, how they would call upon and unceasingly plead,
   "Do not cast me from Your presence or take Your Holy Spirit from me"
   (Psalm 51:11).

   Ah, yes, if only your own soul realized and apprehended on what her
   salvation, her adornment and her glory depended, how she would without
   ceasing call upon and plead for the experience of the holy presence of
   the Spirit. If the riches of the Holy Spirit were known and understood,
   how love for the Spirit would explode, set souls aglow and bring about
   an awakening of the dead.

   =============

   As it is, we tend to conduct most of our affairs without the Holy
   Spirit. We have a Father, who cares for our necessities, who is the
   healer of our diseases and upon whom we call upon in times of danger.
   We have a Jesus who died for our sins and through whom we have
   redemption through His blood.

   And now, what of our sanctification and preparation for the road to
   life ahead? Oh, that! We half pretend we can manage that mostly on our
   own, possibly needing a bit of extra power provided by some entity
   outside of us that we label "Holy Spirit." Such an attitude grieves the
   Spirit; He takes it as a reproach. It may not prevent Him from doing
   His work, but it does hold it up. Till people go through their deep
   valleys to arrive at life and some appear again who love the Holy
   Spirit, entrust their souls to Him and gain understanding that all
   blessings flow out of Him, then there is life again, life in the heart,
   life in the Church, and life among the nations!

   That is a life that arouses opposition, evokes hate; a life that
   provokes the active hostility of death, sin and the devil, but that
   knows no distress. The life sap moves about. There is faith once again,
   a faith that is lived and brings blessing to the soul. The angels of
   God who see it, burst into praise in holy joy. And everything that
   receives breath from the Spirit sings, "Veni, Creator Spiritus! Come
   Spirit, the Creator of life!"

   That Spirit takes pleasure in His own work, the pleasure being
   salvation, the salvation that is available already here on earth for
   all God's children.

   Meditation 24*

   The Lion Has Roared

   The lion has roared--
   who will not fear?
   The Sovereign Lord has spoken--
   who can but prophesy?
   Amos 3:8

   Most readers of these meditations have never heard the roar of a lion
   with his full strength in the wild. We may have heard the sound with
   which a lion makes the bars of his zoo cage shimmer. Even then does it
   make us shiver, as when it snorts out of his nostrils, snores out of
   his throat or roars with his wide opened maw. But what is this snore of
   the basically tame lion in his cage compared to the thundering roar
   with which the wild lion terrifies the desert or spreads shivering fear
   throughout the forest?

   God created that roar. The lion did not just find it, but the Creator
   of this royal animal created and instilled that roar in the king of the
   wild. That roar began as a thought in the Lord of Lords and from there
   this divine thought entered this majestic animal.

   This gigantic, overpowering wild animal is a dreadful illustration to
   us humans, an illustration of brute strength that far supersedes human
   power, of an enigmatic power that lurks in secret places and then
   suddenly wakes up and frightens any nearby human soul. That's the
   reason the roar of a lion can serve at the same time as an image of the
   wrath of God as well as of the stealthy crawl of satan. The immense
   wrath of God and that snorting of satan are both superhuman powers that
   create images within us and symbolically speak to us through that
   unsettling animal. Such animals also have their purpose, which, among
   others, is this higher role of reminding us humans of the reality of
   immense super-human powers.

   ===============

   The Scripture frequently points us to the roar of God's wrath and
   compares it to the roar of a lion in the forest. In Hosea we read,
   "They will follow the Lord; He will roar like a lion. When He roars,
   His children will come trembling from the west" (Hosea 11:10). Or take
   Isaiah: "As a lion growls, a great lion over its prey--and though a
   whole band of shepherds is called together against it, it is not
   frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamor--so the Lord
   Almighty will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights"
   (Isaiah 31:4). And John wrote on Patmos, "He gave a loud shout like the
   roar of a lion. When He shouted, the voices of the seven thunders
   spoke" (Revelation 10:3).

   When you walk carefree along the trail in the forest and are oblivious
   to any danger, let alone a lion, that does not mean there is no lion.
   She may be hiding with her cubs in the thick of the underbrush,
   awaiting her hour and ready to pounce upon her prey. When she sees her
   victim from afar, she opens her maw wide, lets her manes rise up and
   allows the warmth of her blood spurt out of her throat and nose as
   vapour and then comes the terrifying roar that thunders through the
   woods and makes the entire forest floor shake.

   It is here that the Holy Spirit makes you hear an echo of the bulldozer
   of God's wrath among the nations and in the hearts of individuals.
   Neither the nations nor individuals ever consider that there is an
   immense God in the wild forests of their lives. They live without a
   care, oblivious of any evil or suspicion of a power that will judge
   them. This goes on and on from day to day and from year to year, till,
   suddenly, the Lord lets go a mighty roar in the life of such nations or
   individuals. When we then hear that roar of His holy wrath, puny beings
   that we are in our impotence, we tremble with our entire beings and are
   terrified to the very core of our lives before the face of the Lord of
   Lords.

   ============

   Our conscience is the ear with which we hear the roaring Lion.
   Conscience, that wonderful interpreter of our inner thoughts,
   immediately interprets for us in a pithy and touching way what the
   wrath of God crashing into our lives means for us. That conscience is a
   wonderful memory created within us that reminds us in a split second
   and in vivid shades and colours of our forgotten past with its sinful
   history. It is that which relentlessly prostrates us, never gives us a
   way out, but judges us constantly and irrevocably. Our conscience
   within us understands that roar of the Lion and makes us shudder,
   because we have provoked the Lion of Judah. That is what grooves into
   our soul that endless, deep, cutting mortal agony.

   The Lord God is on the way! Hear the roar of that Lion. I, I have
   infuriated this almighty God with His immense majesty!

   =============

   And then, suddenly, you lighten up. You no longer consider resisting,
   while fleeing will not help. In your fear, even before you feel all
   torn up inside of you, you feel yourself already succumb. And that is
   what saves you. Once that roar of the Lion overpowers you and makes you
   shudder, then suddenly the tickling, the excitement and that sinful
   search for your own ego falls away along with your egomania and your
   proud self-confidence. You suddenly find yourself reduced, dwindled
   and, as you collapse, your evil heart breaks and the proud spirit
   within you is squashed.

   And then, then everything is glorious! Now the roaring of the Lion has
   suddenly achieved within you that which all the pressure to love, all
   words of warning or all holy intentions were not able to accomplish.
   Now it vibrates again in your soul that you are responsible to God and
   are to keep Him in mind, Him, the Eternal One, the almighty and
   all-authoritative God. Your soul lifts itself above the insignificant
   and lets go of all trivial spirituality.

   The game is over; things are serious now. Dragging and slow feet are
   replaced by a steady and firm step. Even though the roar of the Lion
   may cease, you will never again forget the voice of the Lord of Lords,
   but you will walk in the awareness of His fellowship.

   =============

   And so that roar of the Lion will soon cease, but the nations have been
   startled and many hearts have become despondent in fearful terror. Ah,
   if only the children of God were attuned to their conscience and catch
   the vibration of God's majestic wrath. So many are slumbering that need
   to be woken up again, not tomorrow, but right now. See, the Lord
   beckons and all His children need to follow His cue.

   And then there are so many children of God who still walk around
   unconverted but who will sooner or later be adopted as children, even
   though their ear is still plugged and their capacity to believe is
   still dulled. While they are still on their carefree path, they, too,
   need to perceive the roar of the Lion. They are the Lord's and need
   therefore to join His people.

   The majesty of the Lord of Lords is so indescribably horrific. Does
   your heart sense nothing at all? If you experienced that roar, how can
   your heart withstand it?

   Meditation 25*

   You Are the Branches [1]

   I am the vine; you are the branches.
   If you remain in Me and I in you,
   you will bear much fruit;
   apart from Me you can do nothing.
   John 15:5

   A branch of a grapevine is nothing but a channel or a tube though which
   the root pumps the sap of the vine up to the trusses of grapes. Without
   the vine itself, the branch is nothing, insignificant and has nothing
   to offer, for the life is in the vine, while the fruit ripens in the
   grape trusses. The branch is between trunk and truss; its function is
   to suck up the sap, pump it up and let it through; also to carry the
   trusses till the grapes are ripe to be harvested. The significant parts
   are the vine plant itself and the grape trusses, but the branches are
   incidental.

   Even as wood, branches of a grapevine have no value, for there is no
   wood that has less purpose or use. The grapevine has value and people
   offer money for grapes, but no one offers anything for just the
   branches. A branch, Jesus Himself said, has no use of its own beyond
   that of an ordinary weed that gets thrown away or burnt in the fire and
   the flames destroy it. The Lord thus deeply humiliated His people when
   He told them, "You are the branches," branches, the most useless and
   disposable item that a grower can imagine.

   You proud people with all your pretentions, you pious with all your
   imaginations, you chosen members with all your holy sham, even if you
   claim Peter as your apostle or, like John, consider yourself "the
   beloved of the Lord," you are mere branches! That is your title of
   honour. Therein lies all your hollowness and emptiness.

   =============

   All this, yes, except, and now the page turns completely, except you
   are properly and organically connected to the vine with real living
   fiber that does not only show leaf but also carries hefty trusses of
   swollen grapes. There is a difference of day and night between a branch
   that is cut off and one that is still in place. The branch that is cut
   off is not even worth throwing away; you do the winery operator a
   service if you take it away, but those functioning branches still
   connected, don't touch them. Those connecting branches are worth their
   weight in gold. The owner cares for them, supports them, ties them,
   prunes them and turns them towards the sun. Those branches will produce
   grapes.

   When the owner notices a branch that is functioning properly and
   underneath its leaf notices budding trusses of grapes, then that
   otherwise useless branch has more value to him than the best of wood.
   He will almost defend this branch with his life should someone tear
   that branch or otherwise ruin it.

   So spiritually the page turns as well. You, the people of the Lord, who
   are nothing but branches, once you are grafted into Immanuel and show
   budding grapes, then you who are otherwise less than useless, suddenly
   become indispensable to the vine. Without the branches, the vine cannot
   display its glory; without branches, our Father, our heavenly
   Husbandman, has no fruit to pluck from the Vine.

   =================

   Oh, would that the Lord's people would set their entire hearts on being
   grafted into Immanuel and quit playing around, but, instead, stand next
   to Immanuel or kneel before Him or look up to Him with pleading eyes.
   All your external worldly involvement counts for nothing here. Even if
   you lay the branch on the vine and string it with rushes around the
   vine, it will still wither and the grower will rip it off and dump it.

   Each child of God must be grafted, grown, annexed and plaited with its
   own fiber into this marvelous Vine. She has to be truly one plant with
   Him. By itself empty and hollow, offering only to serve as a passageway
   for the sap of life, but so grafted into and attached to the Vine that
   it does not exist on its own for even a moment, but lives from and
   grows as part of the Vine.

   Even more, it is not enough that you are grafted into your Mediator by
   means of invisible fiber, but, being grafted in Him, you must also want
   to be nothing but His organ. It is not as if you as a branch produce
   the sap and then add it to the vine. Totally sapless and empty
   yourself, you must derive all your power and strength, all praise and
   love, all tenderness and devotion only from Him, your Jesus. Everything
   that goes on within you must first have happened in your Jesus before
   it arises in your heart. It must all be gained, imbibed and, as it
   were, sucked up through Him. The only function of the branch is to be a
   channel of the works of grace, of light, love and life.

   You must allow the sap to pass on to the ends of the trusses to make
   them bud. You may not keep that life sap for yourself in order to cause
   you as empty branch to swell and increase till you reach the size of
   the branches of other trees. The branch uses very little of that sap
   for its own functioning; It pumps it all upward to the trusses. She
   knows that soon the heavenly Husbandman will come to seek the fruits of
   His Son. That's why it is the honour of the branch to offer the richly
   swollen grape trusses not as products of the branch, but as the fruit
   of the Vine, that is, as the fruit of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross to
   the Father, who is in Heaven.

   ==============

   "This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing
   yourselves to be my disciples" (John 15:8). Pay attention: You carry
   the fruit but do not produce it. You carry it as a chandelier carries
   the light, but the fruit does not originate with you anymore than the
   light with the chandelier. You carry it for Christ. What you carry are
   His fruits, the products of His work, of His suffering, of the labour
   of His soul. You yourself have not participated in the least in the
   production of the fruit.

   Yes, it is true that the grapes ripen and mature on your branch,
   something that is an inexpressible honour for you and for which you
   will never be able to praise and thank your Saviour sufficiently. But
   still, yours it is to carry, not for yourself but for Him who will soon
   harvest them. They hang on you, but they are for the Father and come
   from the Son. All your work is to accept them from the Son and, in the
   name of the Son, hand them over to the Father.

   You even may and must make the leaf also grow and mature, but that leaf
   may also not lead you to ostentatiously parade around in your green
   outfit, except to cover the trusses of grapes and to foster their
   ripening. It is the Father, not you, who must be gloried in both leaf
   and fruit. All the glory must be attributed to the Father; yes, through
   you but out of the Son.

   So it goes with anyone wanting to be a branch. A branch is the least
   and most unworthy on its own, but the most lovely when she pumps up the
   sap and thus carries the treasured fruit.

   And now, you people are the branches! How does your soul participate?
   Are your branches attached to the Vine or do you simply lay next to the
   Vine?

   Meditation 26*

   Love through the Holy Spirit

   And hope does not put us to shame,
   because God's love has been poured out
   into our hearts through the Holy Spirit,
   who has been given to us.
   Romans 5:5

   Pentecost is a glorious celebration, but the contents of our thought
   and the holy stimulant of our joy on Pentecost lay hidden deep in our
   spirit. This Holy Spirit, who descended on Pentecost, is the eternal
   and veritable God; of one substance and co-eternal with the Father and
   the Son; proceeding from both Father and Son.

   "You who bring good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who
   bring good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout...; say
   to the towns of Judah, Here is your God!'" (Isaiah 40:9). This text is
   a fitting song of jubilation as the Spirit is descending, even though
   it is different from the birth of the Son. There is no manger, no
   cloths in which to bind Him, no singing of the angel choir. When the
   Spirit descends, there is nothing your eye sees, your ear hears or your
   hand touches of the Spirit of life. To be sure, there were sounds and
   flaring flames, but of only momentary duration without repetition. Just
   for once; more symbol than reality. It was a sign rather than the event
   itself that, being wholly spiritual, hid in spiritual mystery.

   But still, even here it is a matter of your God Himself coming! Not in
   a weaker sense or more external, but in a more intimate and deeper
   sense than in Paradise, on Sinai or at the manger in Bethlehem, for
   here your God does not come to you but in you. Not in order to live
   among you but in you; not as happened in Paradise from where He
   withdrew, but to be with you eternally, to stay with you permanently.
   This is a mystery of inexpressible majesty, which is precisely the
   reason that it astonishes us more than speaks to us, it surprises us
   more than that it rationally convinces us.

   Zion, that is, the Church of God, hardly dares to accept that her God
   Himself came to her when the Holy Spirit was poured out. She lacks the
   courage of faith to actually imagine this immense and most glorious
   fact that God chose her as His temple. That is why she modifies this
   joyful fact, debases and minimizes the Lord's deeds. In her minimal
   faith and unbelief she pretends that a portion of God's holy power came
   to Zion on Pentecost, but not God Himself. Isn't that astounding?

   Think of it. Anyone daring to assert of the Bethlehem manger that it
   was not God Himself who came to us there, but merely a power of God,
   flies in the face of all God's people. Such a claim will be rejected as
   blasphemy. But when someone claims on Pentecost that it was not God the
   Son but the Holy Spirit who came to His temple, then people often feel
   free to downgrade this second miracle of divine compassion by spinning
   their own fabrication, while the Church of the living God hardly
   notices it.

   Therefore this sin in the Church about Pentecost must be resisted at
   all cost. In so far as Zion is so unspiritual as to be incapable of
   absorbing that deep mystery of salvation, she is piling up guilt upon
   guilt for herself. She earns for herself triple guilt over the Lord's
   inheritance when He comes and Zion does not notice and she denigrates
   the coming of her God by rambling on about a coming of His power! No,
   if it were only for the sake of holier import or holier power or even a
   holier spirit, Pentecost would not have been necessary. The Psalmist
   sang of it and the prophet of Jehovah gave thanks for it. No, neither a
   holier spirit nor a sanctifying spirit, but the Holy Spirit came into
   His temple on Pentecost.

   ===============

   The salvation of a soul lies in being known by God and, as a
   consequence, to know God; first partially, but, one day, as we are
   known. Every impulse, all straining and striving in the soul of a child
   of God must strain towards establishing abiding fellowship with the
   Eternal God in its closest and most intimate form. This must not just
   be pious language, desire or wish, but take the form of a straining and
   pressing of the soul; that soul is incapable of resting before it
   reaches this goal. Just as hunger arouses and allows no respite, so
   also must that homesickness of the soul arouse you. Or, to say it with
   the Psalmist, as a deer that has been hunted to exhaustion by dogs and
   can no longer run, thirsts and pants after fresh streams of water
   (Psalm 42:1), so every soul in Zion must pant and thirst after fresh
   streams of life that flow out of the living God.

   Alas, the soul of all mankind has sunk so deep that they in themselves
   no longer seek God, but flee from Him; not chase after Him, but avoid
   Him; not love, but hate Him. In spite of this, God the Lord in His
   divine compassion comes and pours the thirst for life into that
   deteriorated and degenerated soul, even when that soul often does not
   acknowledge that thirst and chooses death instead. Then, when the time
   comes for the soul to meet God, it does not burst out in holy ecstasy
   but continues in its false imagination, "It is not He Himself, but His
   power!" As in the case of Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 8:10, so it is
   said of the Holy Spirit when He came on Pentecost, "The Great Power of
   God!"

   But this takes its toll. For Zion, callous and unfeeling as she veers
   from her God, grieves the Holy Spirit, does Him reproach and thus
   necessarily deprives herself of His input and consolation.

   ==============

   The cause of this sin is clear: our pride. Have you ever given deep
   thought to the difference between these two statements, "In the Holy
   Spirit on Pentecost God Himself came to me!" and "On Pentecost I became
   aware of divine power from on high?" Or don't you sense either that,
   when the Lord God moves into His Zion, Zion must be still, bow down and
   blot itself out in order that God do it all, God work it all out, God
   fulfill it all so that at the end He receive all the glory?

   But if Zion proclaims, "I received divine power on Pentecost," then God
   is the giver of power, but Zion the possessor of power. This implies
   that it is Zion herself that now is going to operate with this holy
   power, pushes through with it and establishes it. And when everything
   comes to an end, then Zion, that is, the child or Church of God, will
   boast she has achieved it herself. Yes, with power from God, true, but
   still herself.

   Many industrial machines were driven with power derived from steaming,
   boiling water. Rolling out the hard iron, plying it, boring it, shaving
   it, bending it--what human strength could do any of it? We used this
   new strength to bend that hard iron as if it were mere tissue paper.
   But listen carefully, for as a ship, made with this kind of machinery
   and driven by steam power, slides from the wharf into the water, what
   engineer will then praise God who provided the steam power? Rather, he
   will praise himself, "I have built that beautiful ship!"

   Thatis the sin we are talking about. When power enters into us in our
   weakness, a power that enhances and strengthens us a hundred fold, and
   with that power we conquer a sin or we bring our body under our
   control, than we often pretend that we, the child of God, are the main
   actor who won the victory and all praise is reserved for us. Even if we
   respond with our lips, "Thanks be to God!" or "Praise God!", this
   amounts to piling up one sin onto another, layer upon layer. Such
   comments are merely superficial, while in the depth of our hearts the
   sentiment remains, "It wasn't God who did this, but we--or I."

   Oh, yes, this makes all the difference. Let me give you an example. You
   are the CEO of a powerful corporation, but things have run stuck and,
   due to your mistakes, the onus is on you. You have created a situation
   best described as plunder and confusion so that you have to go into
   bankruptcy proceedings. However, you try to rescue the situation by
   enlisting a power. That is to say, you hire a specialist to search out
   the problem, to create new capital so as to enable you to recover. In
   due time, all anxiety and all fear for the demise of your corporation
   has vanished. You emerge, of course, as the acknowledged hero. You pay
   your powerful specialist his due and all obligations are taken care of.

   Now take it a step in another direction. You cannot find any help with
   the power to rescue your corporation, but someone else turns up and
   makes you an offer, "I will rescue you, but I have to receive the
   credit. You just sit there and I will do it all for you, but make sure
   I am the acknowledged saviour." The plan works; your corporation is
   back in business, but you have kept yourself in the background, while
   your saviour receives all the credit and honour.

   This first example says it precisely. Anyone who says, "I received
   power from the Holy Spirit," rescues himself with the help of the power
   he received. He may express his thanks with some kind of offering and
   consider all dues paid, but he receives the credit. On the other hand,
   in the second example, the Spirit pushes aside the ego in your heart,
   takes over and replaces you. He proceeds with the rescue and restores
   your soul. Everybody sees what is happening and who is doing what. They
   all step back in the acknowledgement that the Holy Spirit has rescued
   you.

   There you have it. Either the Holy Spirit is regarded as a power made
   available to you for you to do your magic as the engineer with steam
   and electric power does his, or it is the Spirit as your Saviour, who
   makes you recognize your lost condition and then receives the credit
   and walks off with all the honour. This is where the immeasurable
   distance lies between the sin of Pentecost and the Pentecostal Soli Deo
   Gloria! for your God.

   ==============

   All of this depends on love.

   Whom do you love on Pentecost? Yourself or your God? And please do not
   say, "My God, of course!" Even if you're not serious, you could say
   that, for in your sinful nature there resides a consciousness that
   tells you, "That's how it must be." The fact that it isn't that way
   embarrasses you. It is even possible that you imagine yourself to be in
   a genuinely holy state. But if you dig deep down to the root of your
   spirit and test your soul right down in the innermost region of your
   heart, you would not be a child of God unless you would truthfully
   recognize and confess with inner pain in your heart, "No, no, the love
   for myself still overpowers me."

   It isn't that you would not bring any offering or that you would not
   renounce anything or even refuse to go out of the way for your God.
   However, all of this would not touch the deeper mainspring of your
   heart.

   The desire to be saved is in itself a form of self-love. The desire to
   be a child of God is also to love yourself. To be counted among the
   pious and holy is something that can be flattering. The real touchstone
   of love is only whether you are jealous for the honour, praise and
   glory of your God.

   Salvation is to realize between you and God that He is right and you
   are wrong, that He is righteous and you unrighteous and, thus, guilty.
   It includes your acknowledgement of your own unrighteousness and guilt
   without minimizing it in any way, not because you could not carry the
   load and were convinced, but because you could not bear the thought
   that there might be even a smattering of wrong with God or even some
   minimum of guilt with the Most High.

   Love for God is to love Him more than the pupil of your eye. It is to
   prefer the honour of your Lord above your own. It is to be consumed
   inwardly by worship and adoration of the graciousness of the Eternal
   One so that you cannot keep your eyes off Him and are passionate about
   the beauty of your God who appears in full glory in Zion.

   It is not a matter of calculating, "God did this for me, thus I need to
   do something for Him!" No deliberation: "He is my God and thus I must
   prostrate myself before Him in adoration!" But as a child, upon seeing
   a beautiful fire display, cannot keep it within herself but shouts it
   out in excitement, so you must shout out in amazement and wonderment
   about the splendour of His majesty and the glory of His graciousness.
   You are to proclaim the graciousness of Him who has called you into His
   marvelous light! All this not because, after checking it all out, you
   have rationally come to the conclusion that it is all beautiful and
   true, but because it has enraptured you, carried you away, and
   overwhelmed, consumed you inwardly in adoration.

   Love is to be incapable of anything other than to love. It is the love
   in the depth of your soul for the Eternal One. It is a pleading, "Come,
   Lord, and speak to my soul!" It is pining to be near Him; not being
   able to live outside of Him. It is to see nothing else but Him when He
   comes, to think of nothing but His glory, and to be blessed in losing
   yourself in the Lord your God.

   ===============

   And what is the nature of this love? Is it a case of this love being
   there first, after which the Lord comes and this waiting love now gets
   focused on Him? Quite the contrary. The sun cannot be seen unless it
   first shines its rays by which you see her. Similarly, Zion calls out
   to her God, "Lord, we see light only in Your light!" No, this love does
   not originate with you in order to direct itself towards Him. He
   Himself inspires and evokes it within you; He Himself pours it into
   you. That sole Object of your most holy love Himself ignites the spark
   in you that will light the fire of love in your soul for Him.

   Yes, even when He occasionally hides to test your love and to see
   whether, not seeing Him, you still love Him, even then it is His dimmed
   radiance that causes this love to continue in you. It is not your heart
   that has enough love in itself to love Him, but it is your precious
   God, who is able to penetrate the soul of His child and nurture the
   gift of love in you. It is not your eye that finds the light, but the
   light attracts your eye and has itself trained your eye to see it.

   For example, a new-born infant is shy of bright light so that you need
   to shield its half opened eyes with your hand. Even you yourself shut
   your eyes momentarily, when you suddenly enter a lighted place out of
   the darkness. And so it is with this divine Light. Left to itself, the
   eye of your soul would avoid it and shut, but it is from this Light
   itself that the eye of your soul learns to gaze upon Him.

   ================

   That is the reason the holy Apostle raves of a love that has been
   poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. It is not that this
   love has any material substance like water of its own that lives in our
   soul as an ingredient in its own right, but more like the light that
   pours its rays into the valley and into the deepest clefts of the
   mountains. That is how the Holy Spirit pours His light into the
   crevices and cracks of your heart. Wherever that light penetrates,
   there the moldy place turns green and blooms; the germ raises its head;
   a new dynamic develops and life begins to flourish. Ah, then the flower
   opens up to the rays of the sun and turns to the light. It is this kind
   of love that pulls the souls of God's children to Him.

   When the sun shines on quiet waters, it transforms drops of water into
   vapour. This warmed up steam then rises above the waters towards the
   sun and forms clouds. That is the way the rays of the Eternal Love work
   on an abandoned soul. At first it floats as a drop of water in the cold
   waters. But then come those rays of light over the water of the soul
   that it catches and it in turn then warms the soul. Next, the warmth
   makes the soul more pliable so that it loses its stiffness, whereupon
   she at last ascends upward to the Fountain of her light.

   And that is precisely the glory of Pentecost. It is not God Himself
   just coming over you in Paradise with a local wind that happened to be
   blowing at the time.... No, it is God penetrating into your own spirit
   and being to live in the innermost chambers of your soul.

   And so the great Pentecost question to you is whether you are willing
   to be absorbed through this divine penetration into the depth of your
   being? Whether you are willing, using the example used above, to be
   transformed from flowing water to ascending vapour, no longer
   searching, removing all your own weight, and now ascend in tender love
   to Him who draws you?

   Of course, all this takes place away from the multitude. For them this
   is the equivalence of being full of sweet wine. The world regards this
   as fanaticism and the semi-righteous as overdone. But that's how it
   must be.

   These blessings emerge from the mystery of salvation, which is revealed
   only to the children of God and only according to His covenant of
   peace.
