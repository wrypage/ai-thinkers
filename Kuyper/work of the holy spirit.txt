PREFACE OF THE AUTHOR.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Special treatises on the Person of the Holy Spirit are comparatively
   few, and systematic treatment of His Work is still more uncommon. In
   dogmatics, it is true, this subject is introduced, developed, and
   explained, but special treatment is exceptional.

   As much as there is written on Christ, so little is there written on
   the Holy Spirit. The work of John Owen on this subject is most widely
   known and still unsurpassed. In fact, John Owen wrote three works on
   the Holy Spirit; published in 1674, 1682, and 1693. He was naturally a
   prolific writer and theologian. Born in 1616, he died at the good old
   age of seventy-five years, in 1691. From 1642, when he published his
   first book, he continued writing books until his death.

   In 1826 Richard Baynes reissued the works of John Owen, D.D., edited by
   Thomas Russell, A.M., with memoirs of his life and writings (twenty-one
   volumes). This edition is still in the market, and offers a treasury of
   sound and thorough theology.

   Besides Owen's works I mention the following:

   David Rungius, "Proof of the Eternity and Eternal Godhead of the Holy
   Spirit," Wittenberg, 1599.

   Seb. Nieman, "On the Holy Spirit," Jena, 1655.

   Joannes Ernest Gerhard, "On the Person of the Holy Spirit," Jena, 1660.

   Theod. Hackspann, "Dissertation on the Holy Spirit," Jena, 1655.

   J. G. Dorsche, "On the Person of the Holy Spirit," KÃ¶ningsberg, 1690.

   Fr. Deutsch, "On the Personality of the Holy Spirit," Leipsic, 1711.

   Gottfr. Olearius (John F. Burgius), "On the Adoration and Worship of
   the Holy Spirit," Jena, 1727.

   J. F. Buddeuss, "On the Godhead of the Holy Spirit," Jena, 1727.

   J. C. Pfeiffer, "On the Godhead of the Holy Spirit," Jena, 1740.

   G. F. Gude, "On the Martyrs as Witnesses for the Godhead or the Holy
   Spirit," Leipsic, 1741.

   J. C. Danhauer, "On the Procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father
   and the Son," Strasburg, 1663. J. Senstius, Rostock, 1718, and J. A.
   Butstett, WolfenbÃ¼ttel, 1749. John Schmid, John Meisner, P. Havercorn,
   G. Wegner, and C. M. Pfaff.

   The Work of the Holy Spirit has been discussed separately by the
   following: Anton, "The Holy Spirit Indispensable." Carsov, "On the Holy
   Spirit in Conviction." Wensdorf, "On the Holy Spirit as a Teacher."
   Boerner, "The Anointing of the Holy Spirit." Neuman, "The Anointing
   which Teaches All Things." Fries, "The Office of the Holy Spirit in
   General." Weiss, "The Holy Spirit Bringing into Remembrance." Foertsch,
   "On the Holy Spirit's Leading of the Children of God." Hoepfner, "On
   the Intercession of the Holy Spirit." Beltheim, Arnold, Gunther,
   Wendler, and Dummerick, "On the Groaning of the Holy Spirit." Meen, "On
   the Adoration of the Holy Spirit." Henning and Crusius, "On the Earnest
   of the Holy Spirit."

   The following Dutch theologians have written on the same subject:
   Gysbrecht Voetius in his "Select-Disput," I, p. 466. Sam, Maresius,
   "Theological Treatise on the Personality and Godhead of the Holy
   Spirit," in his "Sylloge-Disput," I, p. 364. Jac. Fruytier, "The
   Ancient Doctrine Concerning God the Holy Spirit, True, Proven, and
   Divine"; exposition of John xv. 26, 27. Camp, Vitringa, Jr., "DuÃ¦
   Disputationes AcademicÃ¦ de Notione Spiritus Sancti," in his Opuscula.

   Works on the same subject during the present century can scarcely be
   compared with the studies of John Owen. We notice the following:
   Herder, "Vom Paraclet." Kachel, "Von der LÃ¤sterung wider den Heiligen
   Geist," NÃ¼rnberg, 1875. E. Guers, "Le Saint-Esprit, Ã‰tude doctrinale et
   pratique sur Sa Personne et Son OEuvre," Toulouse, 1865. A. J. Gordon,
   "Dispensation of the Spirit."

   This meager bibliography shows what scant systematic treatment is
   accorded to the Person of the Holy Spirit. Studies of the Work of the
   Holy Spirit are still more scanty. It is true there are several
   dissertations on separate parts of this Work, but it has never been
   treated in its organic unity. Not even by Guers, who acknowledges that
   his little book is not entitled to a place among dogmatics.

   In fact, Owen is still unsurpassed and is therefore much sought after
   by good theologians, both lay and clerical. And yet Owen's masterpiece
   does not seem to make a closer study of this subject superfluous.
   Although invincible as a champion against the Arminians and
   Semi-Arminians of the latter part of the seventeenth century, his armor
   is too light to meet the doctrinal errors of the present time. For this
   reason the author has undertaken to offer the thinking Christian public
   an exposition of the second part of this great subject, in a form
   adapted to the claims of the age and the errors of the day. He has not
   treated the first part, the Person of the Holy Spirit. This is not a
   subject for controversy. The Godhead of the Holy Spirit is indeed being
   confessed or denied, but the principles of which confession or denial
   is the necessary result are so divergent that a discussion between
   confessor and denier is impossible. If they ever enter the arena, they
   should cross lances on the point of first principles and discuss the
   Source of Truth. And when this is settled, they might come to discuss a
   special subject like that of the Holy Spirit. But until then such a
   discussion with them that deny the Revelation would almost be
   sacrilegious.

   But with the Work of the Holy Spirit, it is different. For although
   professing Christians acknowledge this Work, and all that it includes,
   and all that flows from it, yet the various groups into which they
   divide represent it in very divergent ways. What differences on this
   point between Calvinists and Ethicals, Reformed, Kohlbruggians, and
   Perfectionists! The representations of the practical Supernaturalists,
   Mystics, and Antinomians can scarcely be recognized.

   It seemed to me impracticable and confusing to attack these deviating
   opinions on subordinate points. These differences should never be
   discussed but systematically. He that has not first staked off the
   entire domain in which the Holy Spirit works can not successfully
   measure any part of it, to the winning of a brother or to the glory of
   God.

   Hence leaving out polemics almost entirely, I have made an effort to
   represent the Work of the Holy Spirit in its organic relations, so that
   the reader may be enabled to survey the entire domain. And in
   surveying, who is not surprised at the ever-increasing dimensions of
   the Work of the Holy Spirit in all the things that pertain to God and
   man?

   Even tho we honor the Father and believe on the Son, how little do we
   live in the Holy Spirit! It even seems to us sometimes that for our
   sanctification only, the Holy Spirit is added accidentally to the great
   redemptive work.

   This is the reason why our thoughts are so little occupied with the
   Holy Spirit; why in the ministry of the Word He is so little honored;
   why the people of God, when bowed in supplication before the Throne of
   Grace, make Him so little the object of their adoration. You feel
   involuntarily that of our piety, which is already small enough, He
   receives a too scanty portion.

   And since this is the result of an inexcusable lack of knowledge and
   appreciation of His glorious Work in the entire creation, holy
   enthusiasm constrained me, in the power of God, to offer my fellow
   champions for the faith once delivered by the fathers, some assistance
   in this respect.

   May the Holy Spirit, whose divine Work I have uttered in human words
   and with stammering tongue, crown this labor with such blessing that
   you may feel His unseen Presence more closely, and that He may bring to
   your disquieted heart more abundant consolation.

   --Amsterdam, April 10, 1888--

   Postscript for American readers, I add one more observation.

   This work contains occasional polemics against Methodism which to the
   many ministers and members of the churches called "Methodist" may
   appear unfair and uncalled for. Be it, therefore, clearly stated that
   my controversy with Methodism is never with these particular churches.
   The Methodism that I contend with prevailed until recently in nearly
   all the Protestant churches as an unhealthy fruit of the Reveil in the
   beginning of this century. Methodism as here intended is identical with
   what Mr. Heath, in The Contemporary Review (May, 1898), criticized as
   woefully inadequate to place Protestantism again at the head of the
   spiritual movement.

   Methodism was born out of the spiritual decline of the Episcopal Church
   of England and Wales. It arose as the reaction of the individual and of
   the spiritual subjective against the destructive power of the objective
   in the community as manifested in the Church of England. As such the
   reaction was precious and undoubtedly a gift of God, and in its
   workings it would have continued just as salutary if it had retained
   its character of a predominant reaction.

   It should have supposed the Church as a community as an objective
   power, and in this objective domain it should have vindicated the
   significance of the individual spiritual life and of the subjective
   confessing.

   But it failed to do this. From vindicating the subjective rights of the
   individual it soon passed into antagonism against the objective rights
   of the community. This resulted dogmatically in the controversy about
   the objective work of God, viz., in His decree and His election, and
   ecclesiastically in antagonism against the objective work of the office
   through the confession. It gave supremacy to the subjective element in
   man's free will and to the individual element in the deciding of
   unchurchly conflicts in the Church. And so it retained no other aim
   than the conversion of individual sinners; and for this work it
   abandoned the organic and retained only the mechanical method.

   As such it celebrated in the so-called Reveil its most glorious triumph
   and penetrated nearly all the Protestant churches, and even the
   Episcopal Church, under the name of Evangelicalism or Low Churchism. As
   a second reaction against the second decline of the Protestant churches
   of that time, this triumph undoubtedly brought a great blessing.

   But when the necessity arose to reduce this new spiritual life to a
   definite principle, and upon this to construct a Protestant-Christian
   life and world-view in opposition to the unchristian philosophies and
   to the essentially pantheistic life and world-view, and to give these
   position and to maintain it, then it pitiably failed. It lacked
   conscious, sharply defined principles; with its individualism and
   subjectivity, it could not reach the social questions, and by reason of
   its complete lack of organic unity, it could not formulate an
   independent life and world-view; yea, it stood everywhere as an
   obstacle to such formations.

   For this reason it is absolutely necessary to teach the Protestant
   churches clearly to see this dark shadow of Methodism, while at the
   same time they should continue to study its precious significance as a
   spiritual reaction.

   Hence my contending with Methodism and my persistent pointing to the
   imperative necessity of vindicating, over against and alongside of the
   purely mechanical subjectivity, the rights of the organic social in all
   human life, and of satisfying the need of the power of objectivity in
   presence of the extravagant statements of subjectivity. This presses
   all the more since in the Methodist theology of America the modern
   tendency is gaining ground.

   The Work of the Holy Spirit may not be displaced by the activity of the
   human spirit.

   Kuyper.

   Amsterdam, April 21, 1899.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE AMERICAN EDITION
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dr. Kuyper's work on the Holy Spirit first appeared in the Heraut in
   weekly installments, after which it was published in book form,
   Amsterdam, 1888.

   This explains the object of the author in writing the book, viz., the
   instruction of the people of the Netherlands. Written in the ordinary
   language of the people, it meets the need of both laity and clergy.

   However, depth of thought was not sacrificed to simplicity of speech.
   On the contrary, the latter was only the instrument to make the former
   lucid and transparent.

   The Heraut is a religious weekly of which Dr. Kuyper has been the
   editor-in-chief for more than twenty years. It is published on Friday
   and forms the Sunday reading of a large constituency. Through its
   columns Dr. Kuyper has taught again the people of the Netherlands, in
   city and country, the principles of the Reformed faith, and how to give
   these principles a new development in accordance with the modern
   conscience of our time.

   Dr. Kuyper is not an apologist, but an earnest and conscientious
   reconstructionist. He has made the people acquainted with the symbols
   of the Reformed faith, and by expounding the Scriptures to them, he has
   maintained and defended the positions of those symbols. His success in
   this respect appears conspicuously in the reformation of the Reformed
   Churches in 1886 and in the subsequent development of marvelous energy
   and activity in Church and State, which are products of revived and
   reconstructed Calvinism. Without the patient toil and labor of this
   quarter of a century, that reformation would have been impossible.

   In his religious and political reformations, Dr. Kuyper proceeded from
   the personal conviction that the salvation of Church and State could be
   found only in a return to the deserted foundations of the national
   Reformed theology; but not to reconstruct it in its worn-out form. "His
   fresh, brave spirit is entirely free from all conservatism" (Dr. W.
   Geesink). He is a man of his time, as well as for his time. The new
   superstructure, which he has been rearing upon the carefully
   reuncovered foundations of the Reformed theology, he seeks to adapt to
   all the needs, demands, and distresses of the present. In how far he
   has succeeded time only can tell.

   Since 1871 he has published in the columns of the Heraut and afterward
   in book form the following: "Out of the Word," Bible studies, four
   volumes; "The Incarnate Word," "The Work of the Holy Spirit," three
   volumes, and "E Voto Dordraceno," an explanation of the Heidelberg
   Catechism, four volumes. This last work is a rich treasury of sound and
   thorough theology, dogmatic and practical. He has published several
   other treatises which have not yet appeared in book form. Among these
   we notice especially "On Common Grace," which, still in process of
   publication, is full of most excellent reading. The number of his works
   amounts already to over one hundred and fifty, a partial list of which
   is to be found following this introduction.

   The following works have been translated into English: "EncyclopÃ¦dia of
   Sacred Theology" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1898); "Calvinism and Art";
   "Calvinism and Our Constitutional Liberties"; "Pantheism and
   Destruction of the Boundaries"; "The Stone Lectures."

   For the better understanding of the work, the translator begs to offer
   the following explanations:

   "Ethical Irenical," or simply "Ethical," is the name of a movement in
   the Netherlands that seeks to mediate between modern Rationalism and
   the orthodox confession of the old Reformed Church. It seeks to restore
   peace and tranquillity not by a return to the original church order,
   nor by the maintenance of the old Confession and the removal of
   deviating ministers through trial and deposition (Judicial Treatment),
   but by making efforts to find a common ground for both parties. It
   proceeds from the idea that that which is diseased in the Church can
   and will return to health: partly by letting the disease alone to run
   its course (Doorzieken)--forgetting that corruption in the Church is
   not a disease, but a sin (Dr. W. Geesink); partly by a liberal
   diffusion of Bible knowledge among the people (Medical Treatment).

   Dr. Chantepie de la Saussaye, a disciple of Schleiermacher, was the
   spiritual father of this Ethical theology. Born in 1818, Dr. De la
   Saussaye entered the University of Leyden in 1836. Dissatisfied with
   the rational supernaturalism of a former generation, unable to adapt
   himself to the vagueness and ambiguousness of the so-called Groningen
   school, or to find a basis for the development of his theological
   science in the treasures of the Calvinistic theology, he felt himself
   strongly attracted to the school of Schelling, and through him he came
   under the influence of Pantheism. During the years of his pastorate in
   Leeuwarden (1842-48) and in Leyden to 1872, he modified and developed
   the ideas of Schleiermacher in an independent way. The Ethical theology
   was the result. Its basic thought may be comprehended as follows:

   "Transcendent above nature, God is also immanent in nature. This
   immanence is not merely physical, but also, on the ground of this,
   ethical. This ethical immanence manifests itself in the religious moral
   life, which is the real and true life of man. It originates in the
   heathen world, and through Israel ascends to Christ, in whom it attains
   completion. Among the heathen it manifests itself especially in the
   conscience with its two elements of fear and hope; among Israel in Law
   and Prophecy; and in Christ in His perfect union with God and humanity.
   For this reason He is the Word par excellence, the Central Man, in whom
   all that is human is realized. However, while until Christ it proceeded
   from circumference to center, after Christ it proceeds in ever-widening
   circles from center to circumference. Life flows from Christ into the
   Church which, having temporarily become an institution for the
   education of the nations, became through the Reformation and the French
   Revolution what it should be, a confessing Church. Its power lies no
   more in ecclesiastical organization, neither in authoritative creed and
   confession, but in moral activity and influence. The divine Word in the
   conscience begins to work and to govern; Christianity is being
   transferred into the moral domain.

   "However; the perfect ethical immanence of God is not attained in this
   dispensation; being always possible, it may be realized in the
   succeeding eons." [1]

   It is not surprising that this theology, obliterating with its
   pantheistic current the boundary-lines between the Creator and the
   creature, should have come in hostile contact with the Reformed
   theology, which most zealously guards these boundary lines. In fact,
   instead of uniting the two existing parties on one common ground, the
   Ethical movement added a third, which in the subsequent conflict was
   much more bitter, arbitrary, and tyrannical than the moderns and which
   has already abandoned the Holy Scriptures in the manner of Wellhausen
   and Kuenen.

   In 1872 Dr. Chantepie de la Saussaye was appointed professor of
   theology in the University of Groningen, succeeding Hofstede de Groot.
   He filled this position but thirteen months. He fell asleep February
   13, 1874.

   His most excellent disciple is the highly gifted Dr. J. H. Gunning,
   till 1899 professor of theology at the University of Leyden.

   The name of Dr. Kohlbrugge is frequently found in the following pages.
   Born a Lutheran, a graduate of the seminary of Amsterdam, a candidate
   for the Lutheran ministry, Dr. Kohlbrugge became acquainted with the
   Reformed theology through the study of its earlier exponents. Known and
   feared as an ardent admirer of the doctrine of predestination, the
   authorities first of the Lutheran then of the State Church refused him
   admission to the ministry. He left Holland for Germany, where for the
   same reason he was debarred from the pulpits of the German Reformed
   churches. At last he was called to the pulpit of a Free Reformed church
   at Elberfeld, established by himself.

   He was a profound theologian, a prolific writer, and one zealous for
   the honor of his Master. His numerous writings--half Lutheran, half
   Reformed--were spread over Holland, the Rhenish provinces, the cantons
   of Switzerland, and even among some Reformed churches of Bohemia.

   Some of his disciples fell into Antinomianism, and occupy pulpits in
   the State Church at the present time. They are called
   Neo-Kohlbruggians. Professor BÃ¶hl, of Vienna, is the learned
   representative of the Old Kohlbruggians. Both the old and the new
   school are strongly opposed to Calvinism.

   The translation of "The Work of the Holy Spirit" was undertaken by
   appointment of the author, to whom the proof sheets of almost all the
   first volume were submitted for correction. Being "overwhelmed" with
   work and being fully satisfied with the translation so far as he had
   seen it, the author decided not to delay the work for the reading of
   the remaining volumes, but to leave that to the discretion of the
   translator. A question of the omission of matter referring to local
   conditions and to current theological discussions was also left to the
   translator's judgment.

   Grateful thanks are due to Rev. Thomas Chalmers Straus, A. M., of
   Peekskill, N. Y., for valuable assistance in preparing this work for
   the press.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

   By PROF. BENJAMIN B. WARFIELD, D.D., LL D.,

   Of Princeton Theological Seminary.

   It is fortunately no longer necessary to formally introduce Dr. Kuyper
   to the American religious public. Quite a number of his remarkable
   essays have appeared of late years in our periodicals. These have borne
   such titles as "Calvinism in Art," "Calvinism the Source and Pledge of
   Our Constitutional Liberties," "Calvinism and Confessional Revision,"
   "The Obliteration of Boundaries," and "The Antithesis between Symbolism
   and Revelation"; and have appeared in the pages of such publications as
   Christian Thought, Bibliotheca Sacra, The Presbyterian and Reformed
   Review--not, we may be sure, without delighting their readers with the
   breadth of their treatment and the high and penetrating quality of
   their thought. The columns of The Christian Intelligencer have from
   time to time during the last year been adorned with examples of Dr.
   Kuyper's practical expositions of Scriptural truth; and now and again a
   brief but illuminating discussion of a topic of present interest has
   appeared in the columns of The Independent. The appetite whetted by
   this taste of good things has been partially gratified by the
   publication in English of two extended treatises from his hand--one
   discussing in a singularly profound way the principles of "The
   Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1898), and
   the other expounding with the utmost breadth and forcefulness the
   fundamental principles of "Calvinism" (The Fleming H. Revell Company,
   1899). The latter volume consists of lectures delivered on "The L. P.
   Stone Foundation," at Princeton Theological Seminary in the autumn of
   1898, and Dr. Kuyper's visit to America on this occasion brought him
   into contact with many lovers of high ideas in America, and has left a
   sense of personal acquaintance with him on the minds of multitudes who
   had the good fortune to meet him or to hear his voice at that time. It
   is impossible for us to look longer upon Dr. Kuyper as a stranger,
   needing an introduction to our favorable notice, when he appears again
   before us; he seems rather now to be one of our own prophets, to whose
   message we have a certain right, and a new book from whose hands we
   welcome as we would a new gift from our near friend, charged in a sense
   with care for our welfare. The book that is at present offered to the
   American public does not indeed come fresh from his hands. It has
   already been within the reach of his Dutch audience for more than a
   decade (it was published in 1888). It is only recently, however, that
   Dr. Kuyper has come to belong to us also, and the publication of this
   book in English, we may hope, is only another step in the process which
   will gradually make all his message ours.

   Certainly no one will turn over the pages of this volume--much less
   will he, as our Jewish friends would say, "sink himself into the
   book"--without perceiving that it is a very valuable gift which comes
   to us in it from our newly found teacher. It is, as will be at once
   observed, a comprehensive treatise on the Work of the Holy Ghost--a
   theme higher than most which could occupy the attention of the
   Christian man, and yet one on which really comprehensive treatises, are
   comparatively rare. It is easy, to be sure, to exaggerate the
   significance of the latter fact. There never was a time, of course,
   when Christians did not confess their faith in the Holy Ghost; and
   there never was a time when they did not speak to one another of the
   work of the Blessed Spirit, the Executor of the Godhead not only in the
   creation and upholding of the worlds and in the inspiration of the
   prophets and apostles, but also in the regenerating and sanctifying of
   the soul. Nor has there ever been a time when, in the prosecution of
   its task of realizing mentally the treasures of truth put in its charge
   in the Scriptural revelation, the Church has not busied itself also
   with the investigation of the mysteries of the Person and work of the
   Spirit; and especially has there never been a time since that
   tremendous revival of religion which we call the Reformation when the
   whole work of the Spirit in the application of the redemption wrought
   out by Christ has not been a topic of the most thorough and loving
   study of Christian men. Indeed, it partly arises out of the very
   intensity of the study given to the saving activities of the Spirit
   that so few comprehensive Treatises on the work of the Spirit have been
   written. The subject has seemed so vast, the ramifications of it have
   appeared so far reaching, that few have had the courage to undertake it
   as a whole. Dogmaticians have, to be sure, been compelled to present
   the entire range of the matter in its appropriate place in their
   completed systems. But when monographs came to be written, they have
   tended to confine themselves to a single segment of the great circle;
   and thus we have had treatises rather on, say, Regeneration, or
   Justification, or Sanctification, or the Anointing of the Spirit; or
   the Intercession of the Spirit, or the Sealing of the Spirit, than on
   the work of the Spirit as a whole. It would be a great mistake to think
   of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit as neglected, merely because it has
   been preferably presented under its several rubrics or parts, rather
   than in its entirety. How easily one may fall into such an error is
   fairly illustrated by certain criticisms that have been recently passed
   upon the Westminster Confession of Faith--which is (as a Puritan
   document was sure to be) very much a treatise on the work of the
   Spirit--as if it were deficient, in not having a chapter specifically
   devoted to "the Holy Spirit and His Work." The sole reason why it does
   not give a chapter to this subject, however, is because it prefers to
   give nine chapters to it; and when an attempt was made to supply the
   fancied omission, it was found that pretty much all that could be done
   was to present in the proposed new chapter a meager summary of the
   contents of these nine chapters. It would have been more plausible,
   indeed, to say that the Westminster Confession comparatively neglected
   the work of Christ, or even the work of God the Father. Similarly the
   lack in our literature of a large number of comprehensive treatises on
   the work of the Holy Spirit is in part due to the richness of our
   literature in treatises on the separate portions of that work
   severally. The significance of Dr. Kuyper's book is, therefore, in part
   due only to the fact that he has had the courage to attack and the
   gifts successfully to accomplish a task which few have possessed the
   breadth either of outlook or of powers to undertake. And it is no small
   gain to be able to survey the whole field of the work of the Holy
   Spirit in its organic unity under the guidance of so fertile, so
   systematic, and so practical a mind. If we can not look upon it as
   breaking entirely new ground, or even say that it is the only work of
   its kind since Owen, we can at least say that it brings together the
   material belonging to this great topic with a systematizing genius that
   is very rare, and presents it with a penetrating appreciation of its
   meaning and a richness of apprehension of its relations that is
   exceedingly illuminating.

   It is to be observed that we have not said without qualification that
   the comparative rarity of such comprehensive treatises on the work of
   the Holy Spirit as Dr. Kuyper's is due simply to the greatness and
   difficulty of the task. We have been careful to say that it is only in
   part due to this cause. It is only in the circles to which this English
   translation is presented, to say the truth, that this remark is
   applicable at all. It is the happiness of the Reformed Christians of
   English speech that they are the heirs of what must in all fairness be
   spoken of as an immense literature upon this great topic; it may even
   be said, with some justice, that the peculiarity of their theological
   labor turns just on the diligence and depth of their study of this
   locus. It is, it will be remembered, to John Owen's great "Discourse
   Concerning the Holy Spirit" that Dr. Kuyper points as hitherto the
   normative treatise on the subject. But John Owen's book did not stand
   alone in his day and generation, but was rather merely symptomatic of
   the engrossment of the theological thought of the circle of which he
   was so great an ornament in the investigation of this subject. Thomas
   Goodwin's treatise on "The Work of the Holy Ghost in Our Salvation" is
   well worthy of a place by its side, and it is only the truth to say
   that Puritan thought was almost entirely occupied with loving study of
   the work of the Holy Spirit, and found its highest expression in
   dogmatico-practical expositions of the several aspects of it--of which
   such treatises as those of Charnock and Swinnerton on Regeneration are
   only the best-known examples among a multitude which have fallen out of
   memory in the lapse of years. For a century and a half afterward,
   indeed, this topic continued to form the hinge of the theologizing of
   the English Nonconformists. Nor has it lost its central position even
   yet in the minds of those who have the best right to be looked upon as
   the successors of the Puritans. There has been in some quarters some
   decay, to be sure, in sureness of grasp and theological precision in
   the presentation of the subject; but it is possible that a larger
   number of practical treatises on some element or other of the doctrine
   of the Spirit continue to appear from the English press annually than
   on any other branch of divinity. Among these, such books as Dr. A. J.
   Gordon's "The Ministry of the Spirit," Dr. J. E. Cumming's "Through the
   Eternal Spirit," Principal H. C. G. Moule's "Veni Creator," Dr.
   Redford's "Vox Dei," Dr. Robson's "The Holy Spirit, the Paraclete," Dr.
   Vaughan's "The Gifts of the Holy Spirit"--to name only a few of the
   most recent books--attain a high level of theological clarity and
   spiritual power; while, if we may be permitted to go back only a few
   years, we may find in Dr. James Buchanan's "The Office and Work of the
   Holy Spirit," and in Dr. George Smeaton's "The Doctrine of the Holy
   Spirit," two treatises covering the whole ground--the one in a more
   practical, the other in a more didactic spirit--in a manner worthy of
   the best traditions of our Puritan fathers. There has always been a
   copious stream of literature on the work of the Holy Spirit, therefore,
   among the English-speaking churches, and Dr. Kuyper's book comes to us
   not as something of a novelty, but as a specially finely conceived and
   executed presentation of a topic on which we are all thinking.

   But the case is not the same in all parts of Christendom. If we lift
   our eyes from our own special condition and view the Church at large,
   it is a very different spectacle that greets them. As we sweep them
   down the history of the Church, we discover that the topic of the work
   of the Holy Spirit was one which only at a late date really emerged as
   the explicit study of Christian men. As we sweep them over the whole
   extent of the modern Church, we discover that it is a topic which
   appeals even yet with little force to very large sections of the
   Church. The poverty of Continental theology in this locus is, indeed,
   after all is said and done, depressing. Note one or two little French
   books, by E. Guers and G. Tophel, [2] and a couple of formal studies of
   the New Testament doctrine of the Spirit by the Dutch writers Stemler
   and Thoden Van Velzen, called out by The Hague Society--and we have
   before us almost the whole list of the older books of our century which
   pretend in any way to cover the ground. Nor has very much been done
   more recently to remedy the deficiency. The amazing theological
   activity of latter day Germany has, to be sure, not been able to pass
   so fruitful a theme entirely by, and her scholars have given us a few
   scientific studies of sections of the Biblical material. The two most
   significant of these appeared, indeed, in the same year with Dr.
   Kuyper's book--Gloel's "Der heilige Geist in des HeilsverkÃ¼ndigung des
   Paulus," and Gunkel's "Die Wirkungen des heiligen Geistes nach d.
   populÃ¤r. Anschauung der apostolischen Zeit and der Lehre d. A. Paulus"
   (2d ed.; 1899); these have been followed in the same spirit by Weienel
   in a work called "Die Wirkungen des Geistes und der Geister im
   nachapostolischen Zeitalter" (1899); while a little earlier the Dutch
   theologian Beversluis issued a more comprehensive study, "De Heilige
   Geest en zijne werkingen volgens de Schriften des Nieuwen Verbonds"
   (1896). Their investigation of the Biblical material, however, is not
   only very formal, but it is also dominated by such imperfect
   theological presuppositions that it can carry the student scarcely a
   step forward. Very recently something better in this respect has
   appeared in such books as Th. Meinhold's "Der heilige Geist und sein
   Wirken am einzelnen Menschen, mit besonderer Beziehung auf Luther"
   (1890, 12mo, pp. 228); [3] W. KÃ¶lling's "Pneumatologie, oder die Lehre
   von der Person des heiligen Geistes" (1894, 8vo, pp. 368); Karl von
   Lechler's "Die biblische Lehre vom heiligen Geiste" (1899, 8vo, pp.
   307); and K. F. NÃ¶sgen's "Geschichte von der Lehre vom heiligen Geiste"
   (1899, 8vo, pp. 376)--which it is to be hoped are the beginnings of a
   varied body of scholarly works from the Lutheran side, out of which
   may, after a while, grow some such comprehensive and many-sided
   treatment of the whole subject as that which Dr. Kuyper has given our
   Dutch brethren, and now us in this English translation. But none of
   them provides the desired treatise itself, and it is significant that
   no one even professes to do so. Even where, as in the case of the books
   of Meinhold and von Lechler, the treatment is really topical, the
   author is careful to disclaim the purpose to provide a well compacted,
   systematic view of the subject, by putting on his title page a hint of
   a historical or exegetical point of view.

   In fact, only in a single instance in the whole history of German
   theological literature--or, we may say, prior to Dr. Kuyper in the
   entire history of continental theological literature--has any one had
   the courage or found the impulse to face the task Dr. Kuyper has so
   admirably executed. We are referring, of course, to the great work on
   "Die Lehre vom heiligen Geiste," which was projected by that
   theological giant, K. A. Kahnis, but the first part of which only was
   published--in a thin volume of three hundred and fifty-six pages, in
   1847. It was doubtless symptomatic of the state of feeling in Germany
   on the subject that Kahnis never found time or encouragement in a long
   life of theological pursuits to complete his book. And, indeed, it was
   greeted in theological circles at the time with something like amused
   amazement that any one could devote so much time and labor to this
   theme, or expect others to find time and energy to read such a
   treatise. We are told that a well known theologian remarked caustically
   of it that if things were to be carried out on that scale, no one could
   expect to live long enough to read the literature of his subject; and
   the similar remark made by C. Hase in the preface to the fifth edition
   of his "Dogmatic," tho it names no names, is said to have had Kahnis's
   book in view. [4] The significance of Kahnis's unique and unsuccessful
   attempt to provide for German Protestantism some worthy treatment of
   the doctrine of the Holy Spirit is so great that it will repay us to
   fix the facts concerning it well in our minds. And to this end we
   extract the following account of it from the introduction of the work
   of von Lechler which we have just mentioned (p. 22 sqq.)

     "We have to indicate, in conclusion, another circumstance in the
     history of our doctrine, which is in its way just as significant for
     the attitude of present day science toward this topic as was the
     silence of the first Ecumenical Council concerning it for the end of
     the first theological age. It is the extraordinary poverty of
     monographs on the Holy Spirit. Altho there do exist some, and in
     some instances important, studies dealing with the subject, yet
     their number is out of all proportion to the greatness and the
     extent of the problems. We doubtless should not err in assuming that
     vital interest in a scientific question will express itself not
     merely in comprehensive handbooks and encyclopedic compendiums, the
     latter of which are especially forced to see to the completeness of
     the list of subjects treated, but of necessity also in those
     separate investigations in which especially the fresh vigor of youth
     is accustomed to make proof of its fitness for higher studies. What
     lacunoe we should have to regret in other branches of theological
     science if a rich development of monographic literature did not
     range itself by the side of the compendiums, breaking out here and
     there new paths, laying deeper foundations, supplying valuable
     material for the constructive or decorative completion of the
     scientific structure! All this, in the present instance, however,
     has scarcely made a beginning. The sole separate treatise which has
     been projected on a really profound and broad basis of
     investigation--the "Lehre vom heiligen Geiste" of K. A. Kahnis (then
     at Breslau), 1847--came to a standstill with its first part. This
     celebrated theologian, who had certainly in his possession in
     surprising measure the qualities and acquisitions that fitted him to
     come forward as a preparer of the way in this uncertain and little
     worthily studied subject, had set before himself the purpose of
     investigating this, as he himself called it, extraordinarily
     neglected' topic, at once on its Biblical, ecclesiastical,
     historical, and dogmatic sides. The history of his book is
     exceedingly instructive and suggestive with respect to the topic
     itself. He found the subject, as he approached it more closely, in a
     very special degree a difficult one, chiefly on account of the
     rnanifoldness of the conception. At first his results became ever
     more and more negative. A controversy with the friends of light' of
     the time helped him forward. Testium nubes magis juvant, quam
     luciferorum virorum importuna lumina. But God, he says, led him to
     greater clearness: the doctrine of the Church approved itself to
     him. Nevertheless it was not his purpose to establish the Scriptural
     doctrine in all its points, but only to exhibit the place which the
     Holy Spirit occupies in the development of the Word of God in the
     Old and New Testaments. There was a feeling that came to him that we
     were standing upon the eve of a new outpouring of the Spirit. But
     the wished-for dawn, he says, still held back. His wide survey,
     beyond his special subject, of the whole domain of science in the
     corporate life of the Church is characteristic no less of the
     subject than of the man. It was not given to him, however, to see
     the longed-for flood poured over the parched fields. His exegetical
     foundation' (chaps. i.-iii.) moves in the old tracks. Since he
     shared essentially the subjective point of view of Schleiermacher
     and committed the final decision in the determining conceptions to
     philosophy, in spite of many remarkable flashes of insight into the
     Scriptures he remained fixed in the intellectualistic and ethical
     mode of conceiving the Holy Ghost, though this was accompanied by
     many attempts to transcend Schleiermacher, but without the attaining
     of any unitary conception and without any effort to bring to a
     Scriptural solution the burning question of the personality or
     impersonality of the Spirit. The fourth chapter institutes a
     comparison between the Spirit of Christianity and that of
     heathenism. The second book deals first with the relation of the
     Church to the Holy Spirit in general, and then enters upon a history
     of the doctrine which is carried, however, only through the earliest
     fathers, and breaks off with a survey of the scanty harvest which
     the first age supplied to the succeeding epochs, in which the
     richest development of the doctrine took place. Here the book
     closes. . . ." [5]

     Thus the only worthy attempt German theology has made to produce a
     comprehensive treatise on the work of the Holy Ghost remains a
     neglected torso till today.

   If we will gather up the facts to which we have thus somewhat
   desultorily called attention into a propositional statement, we shall
   find ourselves compelled to recognize that the doctrine of the Holy
   Spirit was only slowly brought to the explicit consciousness of the
   Church and has even yet taken a firm hold on the mind and consciousness
   of only a small section of the Church. To be more specific, we shall
   need to note that the early Church busied itself with the investigation
   within the limits of this locus of only the doctrine of the person of
   the Holy Ghost--His deity and personality--and of His one function of
   inspirer of the prophets and apostles, while the whole doctrine of the
   work of the Spirit at large is a gift to the Church from the
   Reformation; [6] and we shall need to note further that since its
   formulation by the Reformers this doctrine has taken deep root and
   borne its full fruits only in the Reformed churches, and among them in
   exact proportion to the loyalty of their adherence to and the richness
   of their development of, the fundamental principles of the Reformed
   theology. Stated in its sharpest form, this is as much as to say that
   the developed doctrine of the work of the Holy Spirit is an exclusively
   Reformation doctrine, and more particularly a Reformed doctrine, and
   more particularly still a Puritan doctrine. Wherever the fundamental
   principles of the Reformation have gone, it has gone, but it has come
   to its full rights only among the Reformed churches, and among them
   only where what we have been accustomed to call "the Second
   Reformation" has deepened the spiritual life of the churches and cast
   back the Christian with special poignancy of feeling upon the grace of
   God alone as his sole dependence for salvation and all the goods of
   this life and the life to come. Indeed, it is possible to be more
   precise still. The doctrine of the work of the Holy spirit is a gift
   from John Calvin to the Church of Christ. He did not, of course, invent
   it. The whole of it lay spread out on the pages of Scripture with a
   clearness and fulness of utterance which one would think would secure
   that even he who ran should read it; and doubtless he who ran did read
   it, and it has fed the soul of the true believer in all ages.
   Accordingly, hints of its apprehension are found widely scattered in
   all Christian literature, and in particular the germs of the doctrine
   are spread broadcast over the pages of Augustine. Luther did not fail
   to lay hold upon them; Zwingli shows time and again that he had them
   richly in his mind; they constituted, in very fact, one of the
   foundations of the Reformation movement, or rather they provided its
   vital breath. But it was Calvin who first gave them anything like
   systematic or adequate expression, and it is through him and from him
   that they have come to be the assured possession of the Church of
   Christ. There is no phenomenon in doctrinal history more astonishing
   than the commonly entertained views as to the contribution made by John
   Calvin to the development of Christian doctrine. He is thought of
   currently as the father of doctrines, such as that of predestination
   and reprobation, of which he was the mere heir, taking them as wholes
   over from the hands of his great master Augustine. Meanwhile his real
   personal contributions to Christian doctrine are utterly forgotten.
   These are of the richest kind and can not be enumerated here. But it is
   germane to our present topic to note that at their head stand three
   gifts of the first value to the Church's thought and life, which we
   should by no means allow to pass from our grateful memory. It is to
   John Calvin that we owe that broad conception of the work of Christ
   which is expressed in the doctrine of His threefold office of Prophet,
   Priest, and King; he was the first who presented the work of Christ
   under this schema, and from him it was that it has passed into a
   Christian commonplace. It is to John Calvin that we owe the whole
   conception of a science of "Christian Ethics"; he was the first to
   outline its idea and develop its principles and contents, and it
   remained a peculium of his followers for a century. And it is to John
   Calvin that we owe the first formulation of the doctrine of the work of
   the Holy Ghost; he himself gave it a very rich statement, developing it
   especially in the broad departments of "Common Grace" "Regeneration,"
   and "the Witness of the Spirit"; and it is, as we have seen, among his
   spiritual descendants only that it has to this day received any
   adequate attention in the churches. We must guard ourselves, of course,
   from exaggeration in such a matter; the bare facts, when put forth
   without pausing to allow for the unimportant shadings, sound of
   themselves sufficiently like an exaggeration. [7] But it is simply true
   that these great topics received their first formulation at the hands
   of John Calvin; and it is from him that the Church has derived them and
   to him that it owes its thanks for them.

   And if we pause to ask why the formulation of the doctrine of the work
   of the Spirit waited for the Reformation and for Calvin, and why the
   further working out of the details of this doctrine and its enrichment
   by the profound study of Christian minds and meditation of Christian
   hearts has come down from Calvin only to the Puritans, and from the
   Puritans to their spiritual descendants like the Free Church teachers
   of the Disruption era and the Dutch contestants for the treasures of
   the Reformed religion of our own day, the reasons are not far to seek.
   There is, in the first place, a regular order in the acquisition of
   doctrinal truth, inherent in the nature of the case, which therefore
   the Church was bound to follow in its gradual realization of the
   deposit of truth given it in the Scriptures; and by virtue of this the
   Church could not successfully attack the task of assimilating and
   formulating the doctrine of the work of the Spirit until the
   foundations had been laid firmly in a clear grasp on yet more
   fundamental doctrines. And there are, in the next place, certain forms
   of doctrinal construction which leave no or only a meager place for the
   work of the personal Holy Spirit in the heart; and in the presence of
   these constructions this doctrine, even where in part apprehended and
   acknowledged, languishes and falls out of the interest of men. The
   operation of the former cause postponed the development of the doctrine
   of the work of the Spirit until the way was prepared for it; and this
   preparation was complete only at the Reformation. The operation of the
   second cause has retarded where it has not stifled the proper
   assimilation of the doctrine in many parts of the Church until today.

   To be more specific, the development of the doctrinal system of
   Christianity in the apprehension of the Church has actually run
   through--as it theoretically should have run through--a regular and
   logical course. First, attention was absorbed in the contemplation of
   the objective elements of the Christian deposit and only afterward were
   the subjective elements taken into fuller consideration. First of all
   it was the Christian doctrine of God that forced itself on the
   attention of men, and it was not until the doctrine of the Trinity had
   been thoroughly assimilated that attention was vigorously attracted to
   the Christian doctrine of the God-man; and again, it was not until the
   doctrine of the Person of Christ was thoroughly assimilated that
   attention was poignantly attracted to the Christian doctrine of
   sin--man's need and helplessness; and only after that had been wrought
   fully out again could attention turn to the objective provision to meet
   man's needs in the work of Christ; and again, only after that to the
   subjective provision to meet his needs in the work of the Spirit. This
   is the logical order of development, and it is the actual order in
   which the Church has slowly and amid the throes of all sorts of
   conflicts--with the world and with its own slowness to believe all that
   the prophets have written--worked its way into the whole truth revealed
   to it in the Word. The order is, it will be observed, Theology,
   Christology, Anthropology (Hamartialogy), Impetration of Redemption,
   Application of Redemption; and in the nature of the case, the topics
   that fall under the rubric of the application of redemption could not
   be solidly investigated until the basis had been laid for them in the
   assimilation of the preceding topics. We have connected the great names
   of Athanasius and his worthy successors who fought out the
   Christological disputes, of Augustine and of Anselm, with the precedent
   stages of this development. It was the leaders of the Reformation who
   were called on to add the capstone to the structure by working out the
   facts as to the application of redemption to the soul of man through
   the Holy Spirit. Some elements of the doctrine of the Spirit are indeed
   implicated in earlier discussions. For example, the deity and
   personality of the Spirit--the whole doctrine of His person--was a part
   of the doctrine of the Trinity, and this accordingly became a topic for
   early debate, and patristic literature is rich in discussions of it.
   The authority of Scripture was fundamental to the whole doctrinal
   discussion, and the doctrine of the inspiration of the prophets and
   apostles by the Spirit was therefore asserted from the beginning with
   great emphasis. In the determination of man's need in the Pelagian
   controversy much was necessarily determined about "Grace,"--its
   necessity, its prevenience, its efficacy, its indefectibility,--and in
   this much was anticipated of what was afterward to be more orderly
   developed in the doctrine of the interior work of the Spirit; and
   accordingly there is much in Augustine which readumbrates the
   determination of later times. But even in Augustine there is a
   vagueness and tentativeness in the treatment of these topics which
   advises us that while the facts relative to man and his needs and the
   methods of God's working upon him to salvation are firmly grasped,
   these same facts relative to the personal activities of the Spirit as
   yet await their full assimilation. Another step had yet to be taken;
   the Church needed to wait yet for Anselm to set on foot the final
   determination of the doctrine of a vicarious atonement; and only when
   time had been given for its assimilation, at length men's minds were
   able to take the final step. Then Luther rose to proclaim justification
   by faith, and Calvin to set forth with his marvelous balance the whole
   doctrine of the work of the Spirit in applying salvation to the soul.
   In this matter, too, the fulness of the times needed to be waited for;
   and when the fulness of the times came, the men were ready for their
   task and the Church was ready for their work. And in this collocation
   we find a portion of the secret of the immense upheaval of the
   Reformation.

   Unfortunately, however, the Church was not ready in all its parts alike
   for the new step in doctrinal development. This was, of course, in the
   nature of the case: for the development of doctrine takes place
   naturally in a matrix of old and hardened partial conceptions, and can
   make its way only by means of a conflict of opinion. All Arians did not
   disappear immediately after the Council of Nice; on the contrary, for
   an age they seemed destined to rule the Church. The decree of Chalcedon
   did not at once quiet all Christological debate, or do away with all
   Christological error. There were remainders of Pelagianism that
   outlived Augustine; and indeed that after the Synod of Orange began to
   make headway against the truth. Anselm's construction of the atonement
   only slowly worked its way into the hearts of men. And so, when Calvin
   had for the first time formulated the fuller and more precise doctrine
   of the work of the Spirit, there were antagonistic forces in the world
   which crowded upon it and curtailed its influence and clogged its
   advance in the apprehension of men. In general, these may be said to be
   two: the sacerdotal tendency on the one hand and the libertarian
   tendency on the other. The sacerdotal tendency was entrenched in the
   old Church, from which the Reformers were extruded indeed by the very
   force of the new leaven of their individualism of spiritual life. That
   Church was therefore impervious to the newly formulated doctrine of the
   work of the Spirit. To it the Church was the depository of grace, the
   sacraments were its indispensable vehicle, and the administration of it
   lay in the hands of human agents. Wherever this sacramentarianism went,
   in however small a measure, it tended so far to distract men's
   attention from the Spirit of God and to focus it on the media of His
   working; and wherever it has entrenched itself, there the study of the
   work of the Spirit has accordingly more or less languished. It is easy
   indeed to say that the Spirit stands behind the sacraments and is
   operative in the sacraments; as a matter of fact, the sacraments tend,
   in all such cases, to absorb the attention, and the theoretical
   explanations of their efficacy as vested in the Spirit's energy tend to
   pass out of the vivid interest of men. The libertarian tendency, on the
   other hand, was the nerve of the old semi-Pelagianism which in Thomism
   and Tridentinism became in a modified form the formal doctrine of the
   Church of Rome; and in various forms it soon began to seep also into
   and to trouble the churches of the Reformation--first the Lutheran and
   after that also the Reformed. To it, the will of man was in greater or
   less measure the decisive factor in the subjective reception of
   salvation; and in proportion as it was more or less developed or more
   or less fully applied, interest in the doctrine of the subjective work
   of the Spirit languished, and in these circles too men's minds were to
   that degree distracted from the study of the doctrine of the work of
   the Spirit and tended to focus themselves on the autocracy of the human
   will and its native or renewed ability to obey God and seek and find
   communion with Him. No doubt here too it is easy to point to the
   function which is still allowed the Spirit, in most at least of the
   theological constructions on this basis. But the practical effect has
   been that just in proportion as the autocracy of the human will in
   salvation has been emphasized, the interest in the internal work of the
   Spirit has declined. When we take into consideration the widespread
   influence that has been attained even in the Protestant world by these
   two antagonistic tendencies, we shall cease to wonder at the widespread
   neglect that has befallen the doctrine of the work of the Spirit. And
   we shall have prosecuted our inquiry but a little way before we become
   aware how entirely these facts account for the phenomena before us: how
   completely it is true that interest in the doctrine of the work of the
   Spirit has failed just in those regions and just in those epochs in
   which either sacramentarian or libertarian opinions have ruled; and how
   true it is that engagement with this doctrine has been intense only
   along the banks of that narrow stream of religious life and thought the
   keynote of which has been the soli Deo gloria in all its fulness of
   meaning. With this key in hand the mysteries of the history of this
   doctrine in the Church are at once solved for us.

   One of the chief claims to our attention which Dr. Kuyper's book makes,
   therefore, is rooted in the fact that it is a product of a great
   religious movement in the Dutch churches. This is not the place to give
   a history of that movement. We have all watched it with the intensest
   interest, from the rise of the Free Churches to the union with them of
   the new element from the Doleantie. We have lacked no proof that it was
   a movement of exceptional spiritual depth; but had there lacked any
   such proof, it would be supplied by the appearance of this book out of
   its heart. Wherever men are busying themselves with holy and happy
   meditations on the Holy Ghost and His work, it is safe to say the
   foundations of a true spiritual life are laid, and the structure of a
   rich spiritual life is rising. The mere fact that a book of this
   character offers itself as one of the products of this movement
   attracts us to it; and the nature of the work itself--its solidity of
   thought and its depth of spiritual apprehension--brightens our hopes
   for the future of the churches in which it has had its birth. Only a
   spiritually minded Church provides a soil in which a literature of the
   Spirit can grow. There are some who will miss in the book what they are
   accustomed to call "scientific" character; [8] it has no lack certainly
   of scientific exactitude of conception, and if it seems to any to lack
   "scientific" form, it assuredly has a quality which is better than
   anything that even a "scientific" form could give it--it is a religious
   book. It is the product of a religious heart, and it leads the reader
   to a religious contemplation of the great facts of the Spirit's
   working. May it bring to all, into whose hands it finds its way in this
   fresh vehicle of a new language, an abiding and happy sense of rest on
   and in God the Holy Ghost, the Author and Lord of all life, to whom in
   our heart of hearts we may pray:

   Spiritus recreator,

   Tu deus, tu datus coelitus,

   Tu donum, tu donator."

  PREFACE OF THE AUTHOR.

   SPECIAL treatises on the Person of the Holy Spirit are comparatively
   few, and systematic treatment of His Work is still more uncommon. In
   dogmatics, it is true, this subject is introduced, developed, and
   explained, but special treatment is exceptional.

   As much as there is written on Christ, so little is there written on
   the Holy Spirit. The work of John Owen on this subject is most widely
   known and still unsurpassed. In fact, John Owen wrote three works on
   the Holy Spirit; published in 1674, 16821 and 1693. He was naturally, a
   prolific writer and theologian. Born in I6I6, he died at the good old
   age of seventy-five years, in 16gi. From 1642, when he published his
   first bpok, he continued writing books until his death.

   In 1826 Richard Baynes reissued the works of John Owen, D.D., edited by
   Thomas Russell, A.M., with memoirs of his life and writings (twenty-one
   volumes). This edition is still in the market, and offers a treasury of
   sound and thorough theology.

  Careful Treatment Required.

   "Who hath also given unto us His Holy Spirit."--1 Thess. iv. 8.

   The need of divine guidance is never more deeply felt than when one
   undertakes to give instruction in the work of the Holy Spirit--so
   unspeakably tender is the subject, touching the inmost secrets of God
   and the soul's deepest mysteries.

   We shield instinctively the intimacies of kindred and friends from
   intrusive observation, and nothing hurts the sensitive heart more than
   the rude exposure of that which should not be unveiled, being beautiful
   only in the retirement of the home circle. Greater delicacy befits our
   approach to the holy mystery of our soul's intimacy with the living
   God. Indeed, we can scarcely find words to express it, for it touches a
   domain far below the social life where language is formed and usage
   determines the meaning of words.

   Glimpses of this life have been revealed, but the greater part has been
   withheld. It is like the life of Him who did not cry, nor lift up nor
   cause His voice to be heard in the street. And that which was heard was
   whispered rather than spoken--a soul-breath, soft but voiceless, or
   rather a radiating of the soul's own blessed warmth. Sometimes the
   stillness has been broken by a cry or a raptured shout; but there has
   been mainly a silent working, a ministering of stern rebuke or of sweet
   comfort by that wonderful Being in the Holy Trinity whom with
   stammering tongue we adore as the Holy Spirit.

   Spiritual experience can furnish no basis for instruction; for such
   experience rests on that which took place in our own soul. Certainly
   this has value, influence, voice in the matter. But what guarantees
   correctness and fidelity in interpreting such experience? And again,
   how can we distinguish its various sources--from ourselves, from
   without, or from the Holy Spirit? The twofold question will ever hold:
   Is our experience shared by others, and may it not be vitiated by what
   is in us sinful and spiritually abnormal?

   Altho there is no subject in whose treatment the soul inclines more to
   draw upon its own experience, there is none that demands more that our
   sole source of knowledge be the Word given us by the Holy Spirit. After
   that, human experience may be heard, attesting what the lips have
   confessed; even affording glimpses into the Spirit's blessed mysteries,
   which are unspeakable and of which the Scripture therefore does not
   speak. But this can not be the ground of instruction to others.

   The Church of Christ assuredly presents abundant spiritual utterance in
   hymn and spiritual song; in homilies hortatory and consoling; in sober
   confession of outbursts of souls wellnigh overwhelmed by the floods of
   persecution and martyrdom. But even this can not be the foundation of
   knowledge concerning the work of the Holy Spirit.

   The following reasons will make this apparent:

   First, The difficulty of discriminating between the men and women whose
   experience we consider pure and healthy, and those whose testimony we
   put aside as strained and unhealthful. Luther frequently spoke of his
   experience, and so did Caspar Schwenkfeld, the dangerous fanatic. But
   what is our warrant for approving the utterances of the great Reformer
   and warning against those of the Silesian nobleman? For evidently the
   testimony of the two men can not be equally true. Luther condemned as a
   lie what Schwenkfeld commended as a highly spiritual attainment.

   Second, The testimony of believers presents only the dim outlines of
   the work of the Holy Spirit. Their voices are faint as coming from an
   unknown realm, and their broken speech is intelligible only when we,
   initiated by the Holy Spirit, can interpret it from our own experience.
   Otherwise we hear, but fail to understand; we listen, but receive no
   information. Only he that hath ears can hear what the Spirit has spoken
   secretly to these children of God.

   Third, Among those Christian heroes whose testimony we receive, some
   speak clearly, truthfully, forcibly, others confusedly as tho they were
   groping in the dark. Whence the difference? Closer examination shows
   that the former have borrowed all their speech from the Word of God,
   while the others tried to add to it something novel that promised to be
   great, but proved only bubbles, quickly dissolved, leaving no trace.

   Last, When, on the other hand, in this treasury of Christian testimony
   we find some truth better developed, more clearly expressed, more aptly
   illustrated than in Scripture; or, in other words, when the ore of the
   Sacred Scripture has been melted in the crucible of the mortal anguish
   of the Church of God, and cast into more permanent forms, then we
   always discover in such forms certain fixed types. Spiritual life
   expresses itself otherwise among the earnest-souled Lapps and Finns
   than among the light-hearted French. The rugged Scotchman pours out his
   overflowing heart in a different way from that of the emotional German.

   Yea, more striking still, some preacher has obtained a marked influence
   upon the souls of men of a certain locality; an exhorter has got hold
   of the hearts of the people; or some mother in Israel has sent forth
   her word among her neighbors; and what do we discover? That in that
   whole region we meet no other expressions of spiritual life than those
   coined by that preacher, that exhorter, that mother in Israel. This
   shows that the language, the very words and forms in which the soul
   expresses itself, are largely borrowed, and spring but rarely from
   one's own spiritual consciousness; and so do not insure the correctness
   of their interpretation of the soul's experience.

   And when such heroes as Augustine, Thomas, Luther, Calvin, and others
   present us something strikingly original, then we encounter difficulty
   in understanding their strong and vigorous testimony. For the
   individuality of these choice vessels is so marked that, unless sifted
   and tested, we can not fully comprehend them.

   All this shows that the supply of knowledge concerning the work of the
   Holy Spirit, which, judging superficially, was to gush forth from the
   deep wells of Christian experience, yields but a few drops.

   Hence for the knowledge of the subject we must return to that wondrous
   Word of God which as a mystery of mysteries lies still uncomprehended
   in the Church, seemingly dead as a stone, but a stone that strikes
   fire. Who has not seen its scintillating sparks? Where is the child of
   God whose heart has not been kindled by the fire of that Word?

   But Scripture sheds scant light on the work of the Holy Spirit. For
   proof, see how much the Old Testament says of the Messiah and how
   comparatively little of the Holy Spirit. The little circle of saints,
   Mary, Simeon, Anna, John, who, standing in the vestibule of the New
   Testament, could scan the horizon of the Old Testament revelation with
   a glance--how much they knew of the Person of the Promised Deliverer,
   and how little of the Holy Spirit! Even including all the New Testament
   teachings, how scanty is the light upon the work of the Holy Spirit
   compared with that upon the work of Christ!

   And this is quite natural, and could not be otherwise, for Christ is
   the Word made Flesh, having visible, well-defined form, in which we
   recognize our own, that of a man, whose outlines follow the direction
   of our own being. Christ can be seen and heard; once men's hands could
   even handle the Word of Life. But the Holy Spirit is entirely
   different. Of Him nothing appears in visible form; He never steps out
   from the intangible void. Hovering, undefined, incomprehensible, He
   remains a mystery. He is as the wind! We hear its sound, but can not
   tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth. Eye can not see Him, ear
   can not hear Him, much less the hand handle Him. There are, indeed,
   symbolic signs and appearances: a dove, tongues of fire, the sound of a
   rushing, mighty wind, a breathing from the holy lips of Jesus, a laying
   on of hands, a speaking with foreign tongues. But of all this nothing
   remains; nothing lingers behind, not even the trace of a footprint. And
   after the signs have disappeared, His being remains just as puzzling,
   mysterious, and distant as ever. So almost all the divine instruction
   concerning the Holy Spirit is likewise obscure, intelligible only so
   far as He makes it clear to the eye of the favored soul.

   We know that the same may be said of Christ's work, whose real import
   is apprehended solely by the spiritually enlightened, who behold the
   eternal wonders of the Cross. And yet what wonderful fascination is
   there even for a little child in the story of the manger in Bethlehem,
   of the Transfiguration, of Gabbatha and Golgotha. How easily can we
   interest him by telling of the heavenly Father who numbereth the hairs
   of his head, arrayeth the lilies of the field, feedeth the sparrows on
   the house-top. But is it possible so to engage his attention for the
   Person of the Holy Spirit? The same is true of the unregenerate: they
   are not unwilling to speak of the heavenly Father; many speak feelingly
   of the Manger and of the Cross. But do they ever speak of the Holy
   Spirit? They can not; the subject has no hold upon them. The Spirit of
   God is so holily sensitive that naturally He withdraws from the
   irreverent gaze of the uninitiated.

   Christ has fully revealed Himself. It was the love and divine
   compassion of the Son. But the Holy Spirit has not done so. It is His
   saving faithfulness to meet us only in the secret place of His love.

   This causes another difficulty. Because of His unrevealed character the
   Church has taught and studied the Spirit's work much less than
   Christ's, and has attained much less clearness in its theological
   discussion. We might say, since He gave the Word and illuminated the
   Church, He spoke much more of the Father and the Son than of Himself;
   not as tho it had been selfish to speak more of Himself--for sinful
   selfishness is inconceivable in regard to Him--but He must reveal the
   Father and the Son before He could lead us into the more intimate
   fellowship with Himself.

   This is the reason that there is so little preaching on the subject;
   that text-books on Systematic Theology rarely treat it separately; that
   Pentecost (the feast of the Holy Spirit) appeals to the churches and
   animates them much less than Christmas or Easter; that unhappily many
   ministers, otherwise faithful, advance many erroneous views upon this
   subject--a fact of which they and the churches seem unconscious.

   Hence special discussion of the theme deserves attention.

   That it requires great caution and delicate treatment need not be said.
   It is our prayer that the discussion may evince such great care and
   caution as is required, and that our Christian readers may receive our
   feeble efforts with that love which suffereth long.

  II.

  Two Standpoints.

   "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of
   them by the breath of His mouth."-- Psalm xxxiii. 6.

   The work of the Holy Spirit that most concerns us is the renewing of
   the elect after the image of God. And this is not all. It even savors
   of selfishness and irreverence to make this so prominent, as tho it
   were His only work.

   The redeemed are not sanctified without Christ, who is made to them
   sanctification; hence the work of the Spirit must embrace the
   Incarnation of the Word and the work of the Messiah. But the work of
   Messiah involves preparatory working in the Patriarchs and Prophets of
   Israel, and later activity in the Apostles, i.e., the foreshadowing of
   the Eternal Word in Scripture. Likewise this revelation involves the
   conditions of man's nature and the historical development of the race;
   hence the Holy Spirit is concerned in the formation of the human mind
   and the unfolding of the spirit of humanity. Lastly, man's condition
   depends on that of the earth: the influences of sun, moon, and stars;
   the elemental motions; and no less on the actions of spirits, be they
   angels or demons from other spheres. Wherefore the Spirit's work must
   touch the entire host of heaven and earth.

   To avoid a mechanical idea of His work as tho it began and ended at
   random, like piece-work in a factory, it must not be determined nor
   limited till it extends to all the influences that affect the
   sanctification of the Church. The Holy Spirit is God, therefore
   sovereign; hence He can not depend on these influences, but completely
   controls them. For this He must be able to operate them; so His work
   must be honored in all the host of heaven, in man and in his history,
   in the preparation of Scripture, in the Incarnation of the Word, in the
   salvation of the elect.

   But this is not all. The final salvation of the elect is not the last
   link in the chain of events. The hour that completes their edemption
   will be the hour of reckoning for all creation. The Biblical revelation
   of Christ's return is not a mere pageant closing this preliminary
   dispensation, but the great and notable event, the consummation of all
   before, the catastrophe whereby all that is shall receive its due.

   In that great and notable day the elements with commotion and awful
   change shall be combined into a new heaven and earth, i.e., out of
   these burning elements shall emerge the real beauty and glory of God's
   original purpose. Then all ill, misery, plague, everything unholy,
   every demon, every spirit turned against God shall become truly
   hellish; that is, every thing ungodly shall receive its due, i.e., a
   world in which sin has absolute sway. For what is hell other than a
   realm in which unholiness works without restraint in body and soul?
   Then man's personality will recover the unity destroyed by death, and
   God will grant His redeemed the fruition of that blest hope confessed
   on earth amid conflict and affliction in the words "I believe in the
   resurrection of the body.'' Then shall Christ triumph over every power
   of Satan, sin, and death, and thus receive His due as the Christ. Then
   wheat and tares shall be separated; the mingling shall cease, and the
   hope of God's people become sight; the martyr shall be in rapture and
   his Executioner in torment. Then, too, shall the veil be drawn from the
   Jerusalem that is above. The clouds shall be dispelled that kept us
   from seeing that God was righteous in all His judgments; then the
   wisdom and glory of all His counsels shall be vindicated both by Satan
   and his own in the pit, and by Christ and His redeemed in the city of
   our God, and the Lord be glorious in all His works.

   Thus radiating from the sanctification of the redeemed, we see the work
   of the Spirit embracing in past ages the Incarnation, the preparation
   of Scripture, the forming of man and the universe; and, extending into
   the ages, the Lord's return, the final judgment, and that last
   cataclysm that shall separate heaven from hell forever.

   This standpoint precludes our viewing the work of the Spirit from that
   of the salvation of the redeemed. Our spiritual horizon widens; for the
   chief thing is not that the elect be fully saved, but that God be
   justified in all His works and glorified through judgment. To all who
   acknowledge that "He that believeth not on the Son shall not see life,
   but the wrath of God abiding on him," (John iii. 36) this must be the
   only true standpoint.

   If we subscribe this awful statement; not having lost our way in the
   labyrinth of a so-called conditional immortality, which actually
   annihilates man, then how can we dream of a state of perfect bliss for
   the elect as long as the lost ones are being tormented by the worm that
   dieth not? Is there no more love or compassion in our hearts? Can we
   fancy ourselves for a single moment enjoying heaven's bliss while the
   fire is not quenched and no lighted torch is carried into the outer
   darkness?

   To make the bliss of the elect the final end of all things while Satan
   still roars in the bottomless pit is to annihilate the very thought of
   such bliss. Love suffers not only when a human being is in pain, but
   even when an animal is in distress; how much more when an angel gnashes
   his teeth in torture, and that angel beautiful and glorious as Satan
   was before his fall. And yet the very mention of Satan unconsciously
   lifts from our hearts the burden of fellow pain, suffering, and
   compassion; for we feel immediately that the knowledge of Satan's
   suffering in the pit does not in the least appeal to our compassion. On
   the contrary, to believe that Satan exists but not in utter misery were
   a wound to our profound sense of justice.

   And this is the point: to conceive of the blessedness of a soul not in
   absolute union with Christ is unholy madness. No one but Christ is
   blessed, and no man can be blessed but he who is vitally one with
   Christ--Christ in him and he in Christ. Equally it is unholy madness to
   conceive of man or angel lost in hell unless he has identified himself
   with Satan, having become morally one with him. The conception of a
   soul in hell not morally one with Satan is the most appalling cruelty
   from which every noble heart recoils with horror.

   Every child of God is furious at Satan. Satan is simply unbearable to
   him. In his inward man (however unfaithful his nature may be) there is
   bitter enmity, implacable hatred against Satan. Hence it satisfies our
   holiest conscience to know that Satan is in the bottomless pit. To
   encourage a plea for him in the heart were treason against God. Sharp
   agony may pierce his soul like a dagger for the unspeakable depth of
   his fall, yet as Satan, author of all that is demoniac and fiendish,
   who has bruised the heel of the Son of God, he can never move our
   hearts.

   Why? What is the sole, deep reason why as regards Satan compassion is
   dead, hatred is right, and love would be blameworthy? Is it not that we
   never can look upon Satan without remembering that he is the adversary
   of our God, the mortal enemy of our Christ? Were it not for that we
   might weep for him. But now our allegiance to God tells us that such
   weeping would be treason against our King.

   Only by measuring the end of things by what belongs to God can we stand
   right in this matter. We can view the matter of the redeemed and the
   lost from the right standpoint only when we subordinate both to that
   which is highest, i.e., the glory of God. Measured by Him, we can
   conceive of the redeemed in a state of bliss, enthroned, yet not in
   danger of pride; since it was and is and ever shall be by His sovereign
   grace alone. But also measured by Him, we can think of those identified
   with Satan, joyless and miserable, without once hurting the sense of
   justice in the heart of the upright; for to be mercifully inclined
   toward Satan is impossible to him who loves God with love deep and
   everlasting. And such is the love of the redeemed.

   Considered from this far superior standpoint, the work of the Holy
   Spirit necessarily assumes a different aspect. Now we can no more say
   that His work is the sanctification of the elect, with all that
   precedes and follows; but we confess that it is the vindication of the
   counsel of God with all that pertains thereto, from the creation and
   throughout the ages, unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   onward throughout eternity, both in heaven and in hell.

   The difference between these two viewpoints can easily be appreciated.
   According to the first, the work of the Holy Spirit is only
   subordinate. Unfortunately man is fallen; hence he is diseased. Since
   he is impure and unholy, even subject to death itself, the Holy Spirit
   must purify and sanctify him. This implies, first, that had man not
   sinned the Holy Spirit would have had no work. Second, that when the
   work of sanctification is finished, His activity will cease. According
   to the correct viewpoint, the work of the Spirit is continuous and
   perpetual, beginning with the creation, continuing throughout eternity,
   begun even before sin first appeared.

   It may be objected that some time ago the author emphatically opposed
   the idea that Christ would have come into the world even if sin had not
   entered in; and that now he affirms with equal emphasis that the Holy
   Spirit would have wrought in the world and in man if the latter had
   remained sinless.

   The answer is very simple. If Christ had not appeared in His capacity
   of Messiah, He would have had, as the Son, the Second Person in the
   Godhead, His own divine sphere of action, seeing that all things
   consist through Him. On the contrary, if the work of the Holy Spirit
   were confined to the sanctification of the redeemed, He would be
   absolutely inactive if sin had not entered into the world. And since
   this would be equal to a denial of His Godhead, it can not for a moment
   be tolerated.

   By occupying this superior viewpoint, we apply to the work of the Holy
   Spirit the fundamental principle of the Reformed churches: "That all
   things must be measured by the glory of God."

  III.

  The Indwelling and Outgoing Works of God.

   "And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth."--Psalm xxxiii.
   6.

   The thorough and clear-headed theologians of the most flourishing
   periods of the Church used to distinguish between the indwelling and
   outgoing works of God.

   The same distinction exists to some extent in nature. The lion watching
   his prey differs widely from the lion resting among his whelps. See the
   blazing eye, the lifted head, the strained muscles and panting breath.
   One can see that the crouching lion is laboring intensely. Yet the act
   is now only in contemplation. The heat and the ferment, the
   nerve-tension are all within. A terrible deed is about to be done, but
   it is still under restraint, until he pounces with thundering roar upon
   his unsuspecting victim, burying his fangs deep into the quivering
   flesh.

   We find the same distinction in finer form among men. When a storm has
   raged at sea, and the fate of the absent fishing-smacks that are
   expected to return with the tide is uncertain, a fisherman's
   awe-stricken wife sits on the brow of the sand-hill watching and
   waiting in speechless suspense. As she waits, her heart and soul labor
   in prayer; the nerves are tense, the blood runs fast, and breathing is
   almost suspended. Yet there is no outward act; only labor within. But
   on the safe return of the smacks, when she sees her own, her burdened
   heart finds relief in a cry of joy.

   Or, taking examples from the more ordinary walks of life, compare the
   student, the scholar, the inventor thinking out his new invention, the
   architect forming his plans, the general studying his opportunities,
   the sturdy sailor nimbly climbing the mast of his ship, or yonder
   blacksmith raising the sledge to strike the glowing iron upon the anvil
   with concentrated muscular force. Judging superficially, one would say
   the blacksmith and sailor work, but the men of learning are idle. Yet
   he that looks beneath the surface knows better than this. For if those
   men perform no apparent manual labor, they work with brain, nerve, and
   blood; yet since those organs are more delicate than hand or foot,
   their invisible, indwelling work is much more exhausting. With all
   their labor the blacksmith and sailor are pictures of health, while the
   men of mental force, apparently idle among their folios, are pale from
   exhaustion, their vitality being almost consumed by their intense
   application.

   Applying this distinction without its human limitations to the works of
   the Lord, we find that the outgoing works of God had their beginning
   when God created the heavens and the earth; and that before that moment
   which marks the birth of time, nothing existed but God working within
   Himself. Hence this twofold operation: The first, externally manifest,
   known to us in the acts of creating, upholding, and directing all
   things--acts that, compared to those of eternity, seem to have begun
   but yesterday; for what are thousands of years in the presence of the
   eternal ages? The second, behind and underneath the first--an operation
   not begun nor ended, but eternal like Himself; deeper, richer, fuller,
   yet not manifested, hidden within Him, which we therefore designate
   indwelling.

   Altho these two operations can scarcely be separated--for there never
   was one manifest without which was not first completed within--yet the
   difference is strongly marked and easily recognized. The indwelling
   works of God are from eternity, the outgoing belong to time. The former
   precede, the latter follow. The foundation of that which becomes
   visible lies in that which remains invisible. The light itself is
   hidden, it is the radiation only that appears.

   The Scripture, speaking of the indwelling works of God, says: "The
   counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, and the thoughts of His heart to
   all generations" (Psalm xxxiii. 11). Since in God heart and thought
   have no separate existence, but His undivided Essence thinks, feels,
   and wills, we learn from this significant passage that the Being of God
   works in Himself from all eternity. This answers the oft-repeated and
   foolish question, "What did God do before He created the universe?"
   which is as unreasoning as to ask what the thinker did before he
   expressed his thoughts, or the architect before he built the house!

   God's indwelling works, which are from everlasting to everlasting, are
   not insignificant, but surpass His outgoing works in depth and strength
   as the student's thinking and the sufferer's anguish surpass their
   strongest utterances in intensity. "Could I but weep," says the
   afflicted one, "how much more easily could I bear my sorrow!" And what
   are tears but the outward expression of grief, relieving the pain and
   strain of the heart? Or think of the child-bearing of the mother before
   delivery. It is said of the decree that it hath "brought forth" (Zeph.
   ii. 2), which signifies that the phenomenon is only the result of
   preparation hidden from the eye, but more real than the production, and
   without which there would be nothing to bring forth.

   Thus the expression of our earlier theologians is justified, and the
   difference between the indwelling and the outgoing works is patent.

   Accordingly the indwelling works of God are the activities of His
   Being, without the distinction of Persons; while His outgoing works
   admit and to some extent demand this distinction: e.g., the common and
   well-known distinguishing of the Father's work as that of creation, the
   Son's as that of redemption, and the Holy Spirit's as that of
   sanctification relates only to God's outgoing works. While these
   operations--creation, redemption, and sanctification--are hidden in the
   thoughts of His heart, His counsel, and His Being, it is Father, Son,
   and Holy Ghost who creates, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost who redeems,
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost who sanctifies, without any division or
   distinction of activities. The rays of light hidden in the sun are
   indivisible and indistinguishable until they radiate; so in the Being
   of God the indwelling working is one and undivided; His personal
   glories remain invisible until revealed in His outgoing works. A stream
   is one until it falls over the precipice and divides into many drops.
   So is the life of God one and undivided while hidden within Himself;
   but when it is poured out into created things its colors stand
   revealed. As, therefore, the indwelling works of the Holy spirit are
   common to the three Persons of the Godhead, we do not discuss them, but
   treat only those operations that bear the personal marks of His
   outgoing works.

   But we do not mean to teach that the distinction of the personal
   attributes of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost did not exist in the divine
   Being, but originated only in His outward activities.

   The distinction of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is the divine
   characteristic of the Eternal Being, His mode of subsistence, His
   deepest foundation; to think of Him without that distinction would be
   absurd. Indeed, in the divine and eternal economy of Father, Son, and
   Holy Spirit, each of the divine Persons lives and loves and lauds
   according to His own personal characteristics, so that the Father
   remains Father toward the Son, and the Son remains Son toward the
   Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both.

   It is right to ask how this agrees with the statement made above; that
   the indwelling works of God belong, without distinction of Persons, to
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and are therefore the works of the divine
   Being. The answer is found in the careful distinction of the twofold
   nature of the indwelling works of God.

   Some operations in the divine Being are destined to be revealed in
   time; others will remain forever unrevealed. The former concern the
   creation; the latter, only the relations of Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit. Take, for instance, election and eternal generation. Both are
   indwelling operations of God, but with marked difference. The Father's
   eternal generation of the Son can never be revealed, but must ever be
   the mystery of the Godhead; while election belongs as decree to the
   indwelling works of God, yet is destined in the fulness of time to
   become manifest in the call of the elect.

   Regarding the permanently indwelling works of God that do not relate to
   the creature, but flow from the mutual relation of the Father, the Son,
   and the Holy Spirit, the distinctive characteristics of the three
   Persons must be kept in view. But with those that are to become
   manifest, relating to the creature, this distinction disappears. Here
   the rule applies that all indwelling works are activities of the divine
   Being without distinction of Persons. To illustrate: In the home there
   are two kinds of activities one flowing from the mutual relation of
   parents and children, another pertaining to the social life. In the
   former the distinction between parents and children is never ignored;
   in the latter, if the relation be normal, neither the father nor the
   children act alone, but the family as a whole. Even so in the holy,
   mysterious economy of the divine Being, every operation of the Father
   upon the Son and of both upon the Holy Spirit is distinct; but in every
   outgoing act it is always the one divine Being, the thoughts of whose
   heart are for all His creatures. On that account the natural man knows
   no more than that he has to do with a God.

   The Unitarians, denying the Holy Trinity, have never reached anything
   higher than that which can be seen by the light of the darkened human
   understanding. We often discover that many baptized with water but not
   with the Holy Spirit speak of the Triune God because others do. For
   themselves they know only that He is God. This is why the
   discriminating knowledge of the Triune God can not illuminate the soul
   until the light of redemption shines within, and the Day-star arises in
   man's heart. Our Confession correctly expresses this, saying: "All this
   we know as well from the testimony of Holy Writ as from their
   operations, and chiefly by those we feel in ourselves" (art. ix.).
     __________________________________________________________________

  IV.

  The Work of the Holy Spirit Distinguished.

   "And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."--Gen. i. 2.

   What, in general, is the work of the Holy Spirit as distinguished from
   that of the Father and of the Son?

   Not that every believer needs to know these distinctions in all
   particulars. The existence of faith does not depend upon intellectual
   distinctions. The main question is not whether we can distinguish the
   work of the Father from that of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, but
   whether we have experienced their gracious operations. The root of the
   matter, not the name, decides.

   Must we then slightly value a clear understanding of sacred things?
   Shall we deem it superfluous and call its great matters hair-splitting
   questions? By no means. The human mind searches every department of
   life. Scientists deem it an honor to spend their lives in analyzing the
   minutest plants and insects, describing every particular, naming every
   member of the dissected organism. Their work is never called
   "hair-splittings," but is distinguished as "scientific research." And
   rightly so, for without differentiation there can be no insight, and
   without insight there can be no thorough acquaintance with the subject.
   Why, then, call this same desire unprofitable when it directs the
   attention not to the creature, but to the Lord God our Creator?

   Can there be any worthier object of mental application than the eternal
   God? Is it right and proper to insist upon correct discrimination in
   every other sphere of knowledge, and yet regarding the knowledge of God
   to be satisfied with generalities and confused views? Has God not
   invited us to share the intellectual knowledge of His Being? Has He not
   given us His Word? And does not the Word illumine the mysteries of His
   Being, His attributes, His perfections, His virtues, and the mode of
   His subsistence? If we aspired to penetrate into things too high for
   us, or to unveil the unrevealed, reverence would require us to resist
   such audacity. But since we aim in godly fear to listen to Scripture,
   and to receive the proffered knowledge of the deep things of God, there
   can be no room for objection. We would say rather to those who frown
   upon such effort: "Ye can discern the face of the sky, but ye can not
   discern the face of your Father in heaven."

   Hence the question concerning the work of the Holy Spirit as
   distinguished from that of the Father and of the Son is quite
   legitimate and necessary.

   It is deplorable that many of God's children have confused conceptions
   in this respect. They can not distinguish the works of the Father and
   of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Even in prayer they use the divine
   names indiscriminately. Altho the Holy Spirit is explicitly called the
   Comforter, yet they seek comfort mostly from the Father or the Son,
   unable to say why and what in sense the Holy Spirit is especially
   called Comforter.

   The early Church already felt the need of clear and exact distinctions
   in this matter; and the great thinkers and Christian philosophers whom
   God gave to the Church, especially the Eastern Fathers, expended their
   best powers largely upon this subject. They saw very clearly that
   unless the Church learned to distinguish the works of the Father, Son,
   and Holy Ghost, its confession of the Holy Trinity could be but a dead
   sound. Compelled not by love of subtleties, but by the necessity of the
   Church, they undertook to study these distinctions. And God let
   heretics vex His Church so as to arouse the mind by conflict, and to
   lead it to search God's Word.

   So we are not pioneers exploring a new field. The writing of these
   articles can so impress those alone who are ignorant of the historical
   treasures of the Church. We propose simply to cause the light, which
   for so many ages shed its clear and comforting rays upon the Church, to
   reenter the windows, and thus by deeper knowledge to increase its
   inward strength.

   We begin with the general distinction: That in every work effected by
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in common, the power to bring forth
   proceeds from the Father: the power to arrange from the Son; the power
   to perfect from the Holy Spirit.

   In 1 Cor. viii. 6, St. Paul teaches that: "There is but one God the
   Father, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are
   all things." Here we have two prepositions: of whom, and by whom. But
   in Rom. xi. 36 he adds another: "For of Him and through Him and to Him
   are all things."

   The operation here spoken of is threefold: first, that by which all
   things are originated (of Him); second, that by which all things
   consist (through Him); third, that by which all things attain their
   final destiny (to Him). In connection with this clear, apostolic
   distinction the great teachers of the Church, after the fifth century,
   used to distinguish the operations of the Persons of the Trinity by
   saying that the operation whereby all things originated proceeds from
   the Father; that whereby they received consistency from the Son; and
   that whereby they were led to their destiny from the Holy Spirit.

   These clear thinkers taught that this distinction was in line with that
   of the Persons. Thus the Father is father. He generates the Son. And
   the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Hence the
   peculiar feature of the First Person is evidently that He is the Source
   and Fountain not only of the material creation, but of its very
   conception; of all that was and is and ever shall be. The peculiarity
   of the Second Person lies evidently not in generating, but in being
   generated. One is a son by being generated. Hence since all things
   proceed from the Father, nothing can proceed from the Son. The source
   of all things is not in the Son. Yet He adds a work of creation to that
   which is coming into existence; for the Holy Spirit proceeds also from
   Him; but not from Him alone, but from the Father and the Son, and that
   in such a way that the procession from the Son is due to His sameness
   of essence with the Father.

   The Scripture agrees with this in teaching that the Father created all
   things by the Son, and that without Him was nothing made that was made.
   For the difference between "created by" and "created from," we refer to
   Col. i. 17: "By Him all things consist," i.e., by Him they hold
   together. Heb. i. 3 is even clearer, saying that the Son upholds all
   things by the Word of His power. This shows that as the essentials of
   the creature's existence proceed from the Father as Fountain of all, so
   the forming, putting together, and arranging of its constituents are
   the proper work of the Son.

   If we were reverently to compare God's work to that of man we would
   say: A king proposes to build a palace. This requires not only,
   material, labor, and plans, but also putting together and arranging of
   the materials according to the plans. The king furnishes the materials
   and plans, the builder constructs the palace. Who, then, built it?
   Neither the king nor the builder alone; but the builder erects it out
   of the royal treasure.

   This expresses the relation between Father and Son in this respect as
   far as human relations can illustrate the divine. In the construction
   of the universe two operations appear: first, the causative, which
   produces the materials, forces, and plans; second, the constructive,
   which with these forces forms and orders the materials according to the
   plan. And as the first proceeds from the Father, so does the second
   from the Son. The Father is the Royal Source of the necessary materials
   and powers; and the Son as the Builder constructs all things with them
   according to the counsel of God. If the Father and the Son existed
   independently, such cooperation would be impossible. But since the
   Father generates the Son, and by virtue of that generation the Son
   contains the entire Being of the Father, there can be no division of
   Being, and only the distinction of Persons remains. For the entire
   wisdom and power whereby the Son gives consistency to all is generated
   in Him by the Father; while the counsel which designed all is a
   determination by the Father of that divine wisdom which He as Father
   generates in the Son. For the Son is forever the effulgence of the
   Father's glory, and the express image of His Person--Heb. i. 3.

   This does not complete the work of creation. The creature is made not
   simply to exist or to adorn some niche in the universe like a statue.
   Rather was everything created with a purpose and a destiny; and our
   creation will be complete only when we have become what God designed.
   Hence Gen. ii. 3 says: "God rested from all His work which He had
   created to make it perfect" (Dutch translation). Thus to lead the
   creature to its destiny, to cause it to develop according to its
   nature, to make it perfect, is the proper work of the Holy Spirit.

  V.

  The Principle of Life in the Creature.

   "By His Spirit He hath garnished the heavens; His hand hath formed the
   crooked serpent."-- Job xxvi. 13.

   We have seen that the work of the Holy Spirit consists in leading all
   creation to its destiny, the final purpose of which is the glory of
   God. However, God's glory in creation appears in various degrees and
   ways. An insect and a star, the mildew on the wall and the cedar on
   Lebanon, a common laborer and a man like Augustine, are all the
   creatures of God; yet how dissimilar they are, and how varied their
   ways and degrees of glorifying God.

   Let us therefore illustrate the statement that the glory of God is the
   ultimate end of every creature. Comparing the glory of God to that of
   an earthly king, it is evident that nothing can be indifferent to that
   glory. The building material of his palace, its furniture, even the
   pavement before its gate, either enhance or diminish the royal
   splendor. Much more, however, is the king honored by the persons of his
   household, each in his degree, from the master of ceremonies to his
   prime minister. Yet his highest glory is his family of sons and
   daughters, begotten of his own blood, trained by his wisdom, animated
   by his ideals, one with him in the plans, purposes, and spirit of his
   life. Applying this in all reverence to the court of the King of
   heaven, it is evident that while every flower and star enhance His
   glory, the lives of angels and men are of much greater significance to
   His Kingdom; and again, while among the latter they are most closely
   related to His glory whom He has placed in positions of authority,
   nearest of all are the children begotten by His Spirit, and admitted to
   the secret of His pavilion. We conclude, then, that God's glory is
   reflected most in His children; and since no man can be His child
   unless he is begotten of Him, we confess that His glory is most
   apparent in His elect or in His Church.

   His glory is not, however, confined to these; for they are related to
   the whole race, and live among all nations and peoples with whom they
   share the common lot. We neither may nor can separate their spiritual
   life from their national, social, and domestic life. And since all
   differences of national, social, and domestic life are caused by
   climate and atmosphere, meat and drink, rain and drought, plant and
   insect--in a word, by the whole economy of this material world,
   including comet and meteor, it is evident that all these affect the
   outcome of things and are related to the glory of God. Hence as
   connected with the task of leading creation to its destiny, the whole
   universe confronts the mind as a mighty unit organically related to the
   Church as the shell to the kernel.

   In the accomplishment of this task the question arises in what way the
   fairest, noblest, and holiest part of the creation is to attain its
   destiny; for to this all other parts must be made subservient.

   Hence the question, How are the multitude of the elect to attain their
   final perfection? The answer to this will indicate what is the Holy
   Spirit's action upon all other creatures.

   The answer can not be doubtful. God's children can never accomplish
   their glorious end unless God dwell in them as in His temple. It is the
   love of God that constrains Him to live in His children, by their love
   for Him to love Himself, and to see the reflection of His glory in the
   consciousness of His own handiwork. This glorious purpose will be
   realized only when the elect know as they are known, behold their God
   face to face, and enjoy the felicity of closest communion with the
   Lord.

   Since all this can be wrought in them only by His indwelling in their
   hearts, and since it is the Third Person in the Holy Trinity who enters
   the spirits of men and of angels, it is evident that God's highest
   purposes are realized when the Holy Spirit makes man's heart His
   dwelling-place. Who or what ever we are by education or position, we
   can not attain our highest destiny unless the Holy Spirit dwell in us
   and operate upon the inward organism of our being.

   If this His highest work had no bearing upon anything else, we might
   say that it consists merely in finishing the perfection of the
   creature. But this is not so. Every believer knows that there is a most
   intimate connection between his life before and after conversion; not
   as tho the former determined the latter, but in such a way that the
   life in sin and the life in the beauty of holiness are both conditioned
   by the same character and disposition, by similar circumstances and
   influences. Wherefore, to bring about our final perfection the Holy
   Spirit must influence the previous development, the formation of
   character, and the disposition of the whole person. And this operation,
   altho less marked in the natural life, must also be traced. However,
   since our personal life is only a manifestation of human life in
   general, it follows that the Holy Spirit must have been active also in
   the creation of man, altho in a less marked degree. And finally, as the
   disposition of man as such is connected with the host of heaven and
   earth, His work must touch the formation of this also, tho to a much
   less extent. Hence the Spirit's work reaches as far as the influences
   that affect man in the attaining of his destiny or in the failure to
   attain it. And the measure of the influence is the degree in which they
   affect his perfecting. In the departure of the redeemed soul every one
   acknowledges a work of the Holy Spirit; but who can trace His work in
   the star-movements? Yet the Scripture teaches not only that we are born
   again by the power of the Spirit of God, but that: "by the Word of the
   Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath
   [Spirit] ofHis mouth." (Psa. xxxiii. 6)

   Wherefore the Spirit's work leading the creature to its destiny,
   includes an influence upon all creation from the beginning. And, if sin
   had not come in, we might say that this work is done in three
   successive steps: first, impregnating inanimate matter; second,
   animating the rational soul; third, taking up His abode in the elect
   child of God.

   But sin entered in, i.e., a power appeared to keep man and nature from
   their destiny. Hence the Holy Spirit must antagonize sin; His calling
   is to annihilate it, and despite its opposition to cause the elect
   children of God and the entire creation to reach their end. Redemption
   is therefore not a new work added to that of the Holy Spirit, but it is
   identical with it. He undertook to bring all things to their destiny
   either without the disturbance of sin or in spite of it; first, by
   saving the elect, and then by restoring all things in heaven and on
   earth at the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   Things incidental to this, such as the inspiration of Scripture, the
   preparation of the Body of Christ, the extraordinary ministration of
   grace to the Church, are only connecting-links, connecting the
   beginning with its own predetermined end; that in spite of sin's
   disturbance the destiny of the universe to glorify God might be
   secured.

   Condensing all into one statement, we might say: Sin having once
   entered, a factor which must be taken into account, the Holy Spirit's
   work shines most gloriously in gathering and saving the elect; prior to
   which are His operations in the work of redemption and in the economy
   of the natural life. The same Spirit who in the beginning moved upon
   the waters has in the dispensation of grace given us the Holy
   Scripture, the Person of Christ, and the Christian Church; and it is He
   who, in connection with the original creation and by these means of
   grace, now regenerates and sanctifies us as the children of God.

   Regarding these mighty and comprehensive operations, it is of first
   importance to keep in view the fact that in each He effects only that
   which is invisible and imperceptible. This marks all the Holy Spirit's
   operations. Behind the visible world lies one invisible and spiritual,
   with outer courts and inner recesses; and underneath the latter are the
   unfathomable depths of the soul, which the Holy Spirit chooses as the
   scene of His labors--His temple wherein He sets up His altar.

   Christ's redemptive work also has visible and invisible parts.
   Reconciliation in His blood was visible. The sanctification of His Body
   and the adorning of His human nature with manifold graces were
   invisible. Whenever this hidden and inward work is specified the
   Scripture always connects it with the Holy Spirit. Gabriel says to
   Mary: "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee." (Luke i. 35) It is said of
   Christ: "That He had the Spirit without measure."

   We observe also in the host of heaven a life material, outward,
   tangible which in thought we never associate with the Holy Spirit. But,
   however weak and impalpable, the visible and tangible has an invisible
   background. How intangible are the forces of nature, how full of
   majesty the forces of magnetism! But life underlies all. Even through
   the apparently dead trunk sighs an imperceptible breath. From the
   unfathomable depths of all an inward, hidden principle works upward and
   outward. It shows in nature, much more in man and angel. And what is
   this quickening and animating principle but the Holy Spirit? "Thou
   sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created; Thou takest away Thy
   breath, they die." (Psalm civ. 29, 30)

   This inward, invisible something is God's direct touch. There is in us
   and in every creature a point where the living God touches us to uphold
   us; for nothing exists without being upheld by Almighty God from moment
   to moment. In the elect this point is their spiritual life; in the
   rational creature his rational consciousness; and in all creatures,
   whether rational or not, their life-principle. And as the Holy Spirit
   is the Person in the Holy Trinity whose office it is to effect this
   direct touch and fellowship with the creature in his inmost being, it
   is He who dwells in the hearts of the elect; who animates every
   rational being; who sustains the principle of life in very creature.

  VI.

  The Host of Heaven and of Earth.

   "The Spirit of God hath made me."--Job xxxiii. 4.

   Understanding somewhat the characteristic note of the work of the Holy
   Spirit, let us see what this work was and is and shall be.

   The Father brings forth, the Son disposes and arranges, the Holy Spirit
   perfects. There is one God and Father of whom are all things, and one
   Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things; but what does the
   Scripture say of the special work the Holy Spirit did in creation and
   is still doing?

   For the sake of order we examine first the account of the creation. God
   says in Gen. i. 2: "The earth was without form and void, and darkness
   was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the
   waters." See also Job xxvi. 13: "By His Spirit He hath garnished the
   heavens; His hand hath formed the crooked serpent [the constellation of
   the Dragon, or, according to others, the Milky Way]." And also Job
   xxxiii. 4: "The Spirit of God hath made me; and the breath of the
   Almighty hath given me life." And again Psalm xxxiii. 6: "By the Word
   of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the
   breath of His mouth." So also Psalm civ. 30: "Thou sendest forth Thy
   Spirit, they are created, and Thou renewest the face of the earth:" And
   with different import, in Isa. xl. 13: "Who hath directed the Spirit of
   the Lord [in creation], or being His counselor hath taught Him?"

   These statements show that the Holy Spirit did a work of His own in
   creation.

   They show, too, that His activities are closely connected with those of
   the Father and the Son. Psalm xxxiii. 6 presents them as almost
   identical. The first clause reads: "By the Word of the Lord were the
   heavens made"; the second: "And all the host of them by the breath
   [Spirit] of His mouth." It is well known that in Hebrew poetry parallel
   clauses express the same thought in different ways; so that from this
   passage it appears that the work of the Word and that of the Spirit are
   the same, the latter adding only that which is peculiarly His own.

   It should be noticed that hardly any of these passages mention the Holy
   Spirit by His own name. It is not the Holy Spirit, but the "Spirit of
   His mouth," "His Spirit," "the Spirit of the Lord." On account of this,
   many hold that these passages do not refer to the Holy Spirit as the
   Third Person in the Holy Trinity, but speak of God as One, without
   personal distinction; and that the representation of God as creating
   anything by His hand, fingers, word, breath, or Spirit is merely a
   human way of speaking, signifying only that God was thus engaged.

   The Church has always opposed this interpretation, and rightly so, on
   the ground that even the Old Testament, not merely in a few places but
   throughout its entire economy, bears undoubted testimony to the three
   divine Persons, coequal yet of one essence. It is true that this too
   has been denied, but by a wrong interpretation. And to the reply, "But
   our interpretation is as good as yours," we answer that Jesus and the
   apostles are our authorities; the Church received its confession from
   their lips.

   Secondly, we deny that "His Spirit" does not refer to the Holy Ghost,
   for the reason that in the New Testament similar expressions occur that
   undoubtedly do refer to Him, e.g., "God hath sent forth the Spirit of
   His Son" (Gal. iv. 6); "Whom the Lord shall consume by the Spirit of
   His mouth" (2 Thess. ii. 8); etc.

   Thirdly, judging from the following passages,--"By the Word of the Lord
   were the heavens made" (Psalm xxxiii. 6); "And God said, Let there be
   light" (Gen. i. 3); and "All things were made by Him, and without Him
   was not anything made that was made" (John i. 3),--there can be no
   doubt that Psalm xxxiii. 6; refers to the Second Person in the Godhead.
   Hence also the second clause of the same verse, "And all their host by
   the Spirit of His mouth," must refer to the Third Person.

   Finally, to speak of a Spirit of God that is not the Holy Spirit is to
   transfer to the Holy Scripture a purely Western and human idea. We as
   men often speak of a wrong spirit which controls a nation, an army, or
   a school, meaning a certain tendency, inclination, or persuasion--a
   spirit that proceeds from a man distinct from his person and being. But
   this may not and can not apply to God. Speaking of Christ in His
   humiliation, one may rightly say, "To have the mind of Christ," or "to
   have the spirit of Jesus," which indicates His disposition. But to
   distinguish the divine Being from a spirit of that Being is to conceive
   of the Godhead in a human way. The divine consciousness differs wholly
   from the human. While in us there is a difference between our persons
   and our consciousness, with reference to God such distinctions
   disappear, and the distinction of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit takes
   their place.

   Even in those passages where "the breath of His mouth" is added to
   explain "His Spirit," the same interpretation must be maintained. For
   all languages show that our breathing, even as the "breathing of the
   elements" in the wind which blows before God's face, corresponds to the
   being of spirit. Nearly all express the ideas of spirit, breath, and
   wind by cognate terms. Blowing or breathing is in all the Scripture the
   symbol of spirit-communication. Jesus breathed on them and said:
   "Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (John xx. 22). Thus the breath of His mouth
   must signify the Holy Spirit.

   The ancient interpretation of the Scripture should not be hastily
   abandoned. Accept the dictum of modern theology that the distinction of
   the three divine Persons is not found in the Old Testament, and
   allusions to the work of the Holy Spirit in Genesis, Job, Psalms, or
   Isaiah are out of the question. Consequently nothing is more natural
   for the supporters of this modern theology than to deny the Holy Spirit
   altogether in the passages referred to.

   But if from inward conviction we still confess that the distinction of
   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly seen in the Old Testament, then
   let us examine these passages concerning the Spirit of the Lord with
   discrimination, and gratefully maintain the traditional interpretation,
   which finds at least in many of these statements references to the work
   of the Holy Spirit.

   These passages show that His peculiar work in creation was: 1st,
   hovering over chaos; 2d, creation of the host of heaven and of earth;
   3d, ordering the heavens; 4th, animating the brute creation, and
   calling man into existence; and last, the operation whereby every
   creature is made to exist according to God's counsel concerning it.

   Hence the material forces of the universe do not proceed from the Holy
   Spirit, nor did He deposit in matter the dormant seeds and germs of
   life. His special task begins only after the creation of matter with
   the germs of life in it.

   The Hebrew text shows that the work of the Holy Spirit moving upon the
   face of the waters was similar to that of the parent bird which with
   outspread wings hovers over its young to cherish and cover them. The
   figure implies that not only the earth existed, but also the germs of
   life within it; and that the Holy Spirit impregnating these germs
   caused the life to come forth in order to lead it to its destiny.

   Not by the Holy Spirit, but by the Word were the heavens created. And
   when the created heavens were to receive their host, then only did the
   moment come for the exercise of the Holy Spirit's peculiar functions.
   What "the host of heaven" means is not easily decided. It may refer to
   sun, moon, and stars, or to the host of angels. Perhaps the passage
   means not the creation of the heavenly bodies, but their reception of
   heavenly glory and celestial fire. But Psalm xxxiii. 6 refers certainly
   not to the creation of the matter of which the heavenly host are
   composed, but to the production of their glory.

   Gen. i. 2 reveals first the creation of matter and its germs, then
   their quickening; so Psalm xxxiii. 6 teaches first the preparation of
   the being and nature of the heavens, then the bringing forth of their
   host by the Holy Spirit. Job xxvi. 13 leads to a similar conclusion.
   Here is the same distinction between the heavens and their ordering,
   the latter being represented as the special work of the Holy Spirit.
   This ordering is the same as the brooding in Gen. i. 2, by which the
   formless took form, the hidden life emerged, and the things created
   were led to their destiny. Psalm civ. 30 and Job xxxiii. 4 illustrate
   the work of the Holy Spirit in creation still more clearly. Job informs
   us that the Holy Spirit had a special part in the making of man; and
   Psalm civ. that He performed a similar work in the creation of the
   animals, of the fowls and the fishes; for the two preceding verses
   imply that verse 27--"Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are
   created"--refers not to man, but to the monsters that play in the deep.

   Grant that the matter out of which God made man was already present in
   the dust of the earth, that the type of his body was largely present in
   the animal, and that the idea of man and the image after which he was
   to be created existed already; yet from Job xxxiii. 4 it is evident
   that he did not come to be without a special work of the Holy Spirit.
   So Psalm civ. 30 proves that, altho the matter existed out of which
   whale and unicorn were to be made, and the plan or model was in the
   divine counsel, yet a special act of the Holy Spirit was needed to
   cause them to be. This is still plainer in view of the fact that
   neither passage refers to the first creation, but to a man and animals
   formed later. For Job speaks not of Adam and Eve, but of himself. He
   says: "The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
   hath given me life." (Job xxxiii. 4) In Psalm civ. David means not the
   monsters of the deep created in the beginning, but those that were
   walking the paths of the sea while he was singing this psalm. If,
   therefore, the bodies of existing man and of mammals are not immediate
   creations, but are taken from the flesh and blood, the nature and kind
   of existent beings, then it is more evident that the hovering of the
   Holy Spirit over the unformed is a present act; and that therefore His
   creative work was to bring out the life already hidden in chaos, i.e.,
   in the germs of life.

   This agrees with what was said at first of the general character of His
   work. "To lead to its destiny" is to bring forth the hidden life, to
   cause the hidden beauty to reveal itself, to rouse into activity the
   slumbering energies.

   Only let us not represent it as a work performed in successive
   stages--first by the Father, whose finished work was taken up by the
   Son, after which the Holy Spirit completed the work thus prepared. Such
   representations are unworthy of God. There is distribution, no division
   in the divine activities; wherefore Isaiah declares that the Spirit of
   the Lord, i.e., the Holy Spirit, throughout the entire work of creation
   from the beginning--yea, from before the beginning--directed all that
   was to come.

  The Creaturely Man.

   "The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath
   given me life."-- Job xxxiii. 4.

   The Eternal and Ever-blessed God comes into vital touch with the
   creature by an act proceeding not from the Father nor from the Son, but
   from the Holy Spirit.

   Translated by sovereign grace from death unto life, God's children are
   conscious of this divine fellowship; they know that it consists not in
   inward agreement of disposition or inclination, but in the mysterious
   touch of God upon their spiritual being. But they also know that
   neither the Father nor the Son, but the Holy Spirit, has made their
   hearts His temple. It is true Christ comes to us through the Holy
   Spirit, and through the Son we have fellowship with the Father,
   according to His word, "I and the Father will come unto you, and make
   Our abode with you"; yet every intelligent Bible student knows that it
   is more especially the Holy Spirit who enters into his person and
   touches his innermost being.

   That the Son incarnate came into closer contact with us proves nothing
   to the contrary. Christ never entered into a human person. He took upon
   Himself our human nature, with which He united Himself much more
   closely than the Holy Spirit does; but He did not touch the inward man
   and his hidden personality. On the contrary, He said that it was
   expedient for the disciples that He should go away; "for if I go not
   away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will send
   Him unto you." (John xvi. 7) Moreover, the Incarnation was not
   accomplished without the Holy Spirit, who overshadowed Mary; and the
   blessings that Christ imparted to all around Him were largely owing to
   the gift of the Holy Spirit, which was given Him without measure.

   Hence the principal thought remains intact: When God comes into direct
   contact with the creature it is the work of the Holy Spirit to effect
   such contact. In the visible world this action consists in the kindling
   and fanning of the spark of life; hence it is quite natural and in full
   harmony with the general tenor of the teaching of Scripture that the
   Spirit of God moves upon the face of the waters, that He brings forth
   the host of heaven and earth, ordered, animated, and resplendent.

   Besides this visible creation there is also an invisible, which, so far
   as our world is concerned, concentrates itself in the heart of man;
   hence, in the second place, we must see how far the work of the Holy
   Spirit may be traced in man's creation.

   Of the animal world we do not speak. Not as tho the Holy Spirit had
   nothing to do with their creation. From Psalm civ. 30 we have proven
   the contrary . Moreover, no one can deny the admirable traits of
   cunning, love, fidelity, and thankfulness in many of the animals. Not
   that we would be foolish on that ground to call the dog half human; for
   these higher animal properties are evidently but instinctive
   preformations, sketches of the Holy Spirit, carried to their proper
   destiny in man alone. And yet, however striking these traits may be, it
   is not a person that meets us in the animal. The animal proceeds from
   the world of matter, and returns to it; in man alone appears that which
   is new, invisible, and spiritual, justifying us in looking for a
   special work of the Holy Spirit in his creation.

   Of himself, i.e., of a man, Job declares: "The Spirit of God hath made
   me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life." (Job xxxiii. 4)
   The Spirit of God hath made me. That which I am as a human personality
   is the work of the Holy Spirit. To Him I owe the human and personal
   that constitute me the being that I am. He adds: "The breath of the
   Almighty hath given me life"; which evidently echoes the words: "The
   Lord God breathed into His nostrils the breath of life." (Gen. ii. 7)

   Like Job, we ought to feel and to acknowledge that in Adam you and I
   are created; when God created Adam He created us; in Adam's nature He
   called forth the nature wherein we now live. Gen. i. and ii. is not the
   record of aliens, but of ourselves--concerning the flesh and blood
   which we carry with us, the human nature in which we sit down to read
   the Word of God.

   He that reads his Bible without this personal application reads amiss.
   It leaves him cold and indifferent. It may charm him in the days of his
   childhood, when one is fond of tales and stories, but has no hold of
   him in the days of conflict, when he meets the stern facts and
   realities of life. But if we accustom ourselves to see in this record
   the history of our own flesh and blood, of our own human nature and
   life, and acknowledge that by human generation we spring from Adam, and
   therefore were in Adam when he was created--then we shall also know
   that when God formed Adam out of the dust He also formed us; that we
   also were in Paradise; that Adam's fall was also ours. In a word, the
   first page of Genesis relates the history not of an alien, but of our
   own real selves. The breath of the Almighty gave us life, when the Lord
   formed man of the dust, and breathed into his nostrils and made him a
   living soul. The root of our life lies in our parents; but through and
   beyond them the tender fiber of that root goes back through the long
   line of generations, and received its earliest beginning when Adam
   first breathed God's pure air in Paradise.

   And yet, tho in Paradise we received the first inception of our being,
   there is also a second beginning of our life, viz., when from the race,
   by conception and birth, each of us was called into being individually.
   And of this also Job testifies: "The Spirit of the Lord hath given me
   life." (Job xxxiii. 4)

   And again, in the life of sinful man there comes a third beginning,
   when it pleases God to convert the wicked; and of this also the soul
   testifies within us: "The Spirit of the Lord hath given me life."

   Leaving this new birth out of the question, the testimony of Job shows
   us that he was conscious of the fact that he owed his existence as a
   man, as a person, as an ego, hence his creation in Adam as well as his
   personal being, to God.

   And what does the Scripture teach us concerning the creation of man?
   This: that the dust of the ground out of which Adam was formed was so
   wrought upon that it became a living soul, which indicates the human
   being. The result was not merely a moving, creeping, eating, drinking,
   and sleeping creature, but a living soul that came into existence at
   the moment when the breath of life was breathed into the dust. It was
   not first the dust, and then human life within the dust, and after that
   the soul with all its higher faculties in that human life; nay, as soon
   as life went forth into Adam, he was a man, and all his precious gifts
   were natural endowments.

   Sinful man being born from above receives gifts that are above nature.
   For this reason the Holy Spirit merely dwells in the quickened sinner.
   But in heaven this will not be so; for in death the human nature is so
   completely changed that the impulse to sin disappears entirely;
   wherefore in heaven the Holy Spirit will work in the human nature
   itself for ever and ever. In the present state of humiliation the
   nature of the regenerate is still the Adam-nature. The great mystery of
   the work of the Holy Spirit in him is this: that in and by that broken
   and corrupt nature, He works the holy works of God. It is as light
   shining through our window-panes, but in no wise identical with the
   glass.

   In Paradise, however, man's nature was whole, intact; everything about
   him was holy. We must avoid the dangerous error that the newly created
   man had an inferior degree of holiness. God made man upright, with
   nothing crooked in or about him. All his inclinations and powers with
   all their workings were pure and holy. God delighted in Adam, saw that
   he was good; surely nothing more can be desired. In this respect Adam
   differed from the child of God by grace in not having eternal life; he
   was to attain this as the reward for holy works. On the other hand,
   Abraham, the father of the faithful, begins with eternal life, from
   which holy works were to proceed.

   Hence a perfect contrast. Adam must attain eternal life by works.
   Abraham has eternal life through which he obtains holy works. Hence for
   Adam there can be no indwelling of the Holy Spirit. There was no
   antagonism between him and the Spirit. So the Spirit could pervade him,
   not merely dwellin him. The nature of sinful man repels the Holy
   Spirit, but Adam's nature attracted Him, freely received Him, and let
   Him inspire his being.

   Our faculties and inclinations are impaired, our powers are enervated,
   the passions of our hearts corrupt; hence the Holy Spirit must come to
   us from without. But since Adam's faculties were all intact, and the
   whole expression of his inward life undisturbed, therefore could the
   Holy Spirit work through the common powers and operations of his
   nature. To Adam spiritual things were not a supernatural, but a natural
   good--except eternal life, which he must earn by fulfilling the law.
   Scripture expresses this unity between Adam's natural life and
   spiritual powers by identifying the two expressions--"To breathe into
   the breath of life," and "to become a living soul." (Gen. ii. 7)

   Other passages show that this divine "inbreathing" indicates especially
   the Spirit's work. Jesus breathed upon His disciples and said: "Receive
   ye the Holy Ghost." (John xx. 22) He compares the Holy Spirit to the
   wind. In both the Biblical languages, Hebrew and Greek, the word spirit
   means wind, breathing or blowing. And as the Church confesses that the
   Son is eternally generated by the Father, so it confesses that the Holy
   Spirit proceedeth from the Father and the Son as by breathing. Hence we
   conclude that the passage, "And breathed into his nostrils the breath
   of life" (Gen. ii. 7)--in connection with, "The Spirit of God moved on
   the face of the waters," (Gen. i. 2) and the word of Job, "The Spirit
   of God hath given me life" (Job xxxiii. 4)--points to a special work of
   the Holy Spirit.

   Before God breathed the breath of life in the lifeless dust, there was
   a conference in the economy of the divine Being: "Let Us make man in
   Our image, after Our likeness." (Gen. i. 26) This shows--

   First, that each divine Person had a distinct work in the creation of
   man--"Let Us make man." Before this the singular is used of God--"He
   spake," "He saw"; but now the plural is used, "Let Us make man," which
   implies that, here specially and more clearly than in any preceding
   passage, the activities of the Persons are to be distinguished.

   Secondly, that man was not created empty, afterward to be endowed with
   higher spiritual faculties and powers, but that the very act of
   creation made him after God's image, without any subsequent addition to
   his being. For we read: "Let Us create man in Our image and after Our
   likeness." This assures us that by immediate creation man received the
   impress of the divine image; that in the creation the divine Persons
   each performed a distinct work; and, lastly, that man's creation with
   reference to his higher destiny was effected by a going forth of the
   breath of God.

   This is the basis of our statement that the Spirit's creative work was
   making all man's powers and gifts instruments for His own use,
   connecting them vitally and immediately with the powers of God. This
   agrees with Biblical teachings regarding the Holy Spirit's regenerating
   work, which also, tho differently, brings the power and holiness of God
   in immediate contact with human powers.

   We deny, therefore, the frequent assertion of ethical theologians, that
   the Holy Spirit created the personality of man, since this opposes the
   entire economy of Scripture. For what is our personality but the
   realization of God's plan concerning us? Such as God from eternity has
   thought each of us, as distinct from other men, with our own stamp,
   life-history, calling, and destiny--as such each must develop and show
   himself to become a person. Thus alone each obtains character; anything
   else so called is pride and arbitrariness.

   If our personality result directly from God's plan, then it and what we
   have in common with all other creatures can not be from the Holy
   Spirit, but from the Father; like all other things, it receives its
   disposition from the Son; and the Holy Spirit acts upon it as upon
   every other creature, by kindling the spark, imparting the glow of
   life.

  Gifts and Talents.

   "And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him."--Judges iii. 10.

   We now consider the Holy Spirit's work in bestowing gifts, talents, and
   abilities upon artisans and professional men. Scripture declares that
   the special animation and qualification of persons for work assigned to
   them by God proceed from the Holy Spirit.

   The construction of the tabernacle required capable workmen, skilful
   carpenters, goldsmiths, and silversmiths, and masters in the arts of
   weaving and embroidering. Who will furnish Moses with them? The Holy
   Spirit. For we read in Exod. xxxi. 2, 3: "I have called by name
   Bezaleel, the son of Uri . . . . and I have filled him with the Spirit
   of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all
   manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in
   silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in
   carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship." Verse 6 shows
   that this activity of the Holy Spirit included others: "In the hearts
   of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
   that I have commanded them." And to give clearest light on this
   subject, Scripture says also: "Then hath he filled with wisdom of
   heart, to work all manner of work of the engraver and of the cunning
   workman, and of the embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet
   and in fine linen of the weaver, even of them that do any work and of
   these that devise cunning work." (Exod. xxxv. 35)

   The Spirit's working shows not only in ordinary skilled labor, but also
   in the higher spheres of human knowledge and mental activity; for
   military genius, legal acumen, statesmanship, and power to inspire the
   masses with enthusiasm are equally ascribed to it. This is generally
   expressed in the words, "And the Spirit of the Lord came upon" such a
   hero, judge, statesman, or tribune of the people, especially in the
   days of the judges, when it is said of Joshua, Othniel, Barak, Gideon,
   Samson, Samuel, and others that the Spirit of the Lord came upon them.
   Also of Zerubbabel rebuilding the temple, it is said: "Not by might nor
   by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord." (Zech. iv. 6) Even of the
   heathen king, Cyrus, we read that Jehovah had called him to His work
   and anointed him with the Spirit of the Lord--Isa. xlv.

   This last instance introduces another aspect of the case, viz., the
   operation of the Holy Spirit in qualifying men for official functions.
   For altho this operation upon and through the office receives its
   fullest significance only in the dispensation of grace, yet the case of
   Cyrus shows that the Holy Spirit has originally a work to perform in
   this respect which is not only a result of grace, but belongs
   essentially to the nature of the work, even tho it is obvious only in
   the history of God's special dealings with His own people.

   It is especially noticeable in the struggle between Saul and David.
   There is no reason to consider Saul one of God's elect. After his
   anointing the Holy Spirit comes upon him, abides with him, and works
   upon him as long as he remains the Lord's chosen king over His people.
   But as soon as by wilful disobedience he forfeits that favor, the Holy
   Spirit departs from him and an evil spirit from the Lord troubles him.
   Evidently this work of the Holy Spirit has nothing to do with
   regeneration. For a time it may operate upon a man and then forever
   depart from him; while the Spirit's saving operation, even tho
   suspended for a time, can never be wholly lost. David's touching
   prayer, "Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me," (Psalm li. 11) must
   therefore refer to gifts qualifying him for the kingly office. David
   had the terrible example of Saul before him. He had seen what becomes
   of a man whom the Holy Spirit leaves to himself; and his heart trembled
   at the possibility of an evil spirit coming upon him, and an end as sad
   as Saul's. Like Judas, Saul dies a suicide.

   From the whole Scripture teaching we therefore conclude that the Holy
   Spirit has a work in connection with mechanical arts and official
   functions--in every special talent whereby some men excel in such art
   or office. This teaching is not simply that such gifts and talents are
   not of man but from God like all other blessings, but that they are not
   the work of the Father, nor of the Son, but of the Holy Spirit.

   The distinction discovered in creation may be observed here: gifts and
   talents come from the Father; are disposed for each personality by the
   Son; and kindled in each by the Holy Spirit as by a spark from above.

   Let us distinguish art itself, personal talent to practise it, and the
   vocation thereto.

   Art is not man's invention, but God's creation. In all nations and ages
   men have pursued the arts of weaving, embroidering, skilful
   dressmaking, casting and chasing noble metals, cutting and polishing
   diamonds, molding iron and brass; and in all these countries and ages,
   without knowing of each other's efforts, have applied the same arts to
   all these materials. Of course there is a difference. Oriental work
   bears a stamp quite different from that of the West. Even French and
   German work differ. But under the differences, the endeavor, the art
   applied, the material, the ideal pursued are the same. So, too, art did
   not attain perfection all at once; among the nations forms at first
   crude and awkward gradually developed into forms chaste, refined, and
   beautiful. Successive generations improved upon previous achievements,
   until among the various nations comparative perfection of art and skill
   was attained. Hence art is not the result of man's thought and purpose;
   but God has placed in various materials certain possibilities of
   workmanship, and by applying this workmanship man must make out of each
   what there is in it, and not whatever he chooses.

   Two things must cooperate to effect this. In the creation of gold,
   silver, wood, iron, God must have placed in them certain possibilities,
   and have created inventive power in man's mind, perseverance in his
   will, strength in his muscle, accurate vision in his eye, delicacy of
   touch and action in his fingers, thus qualifying him to evolve what is
   latent in the materials. Since this labor has the same nature among all
   nations, the perpetual progress of the same great work being
   accomplished according to the same majestic plan, through successive
   generations, all artistic skill and executive ability must be wrought
   in man by a higher power and according to a higher command. Viewing the
   treasures of an industrial exposition in the light of the revealed
   Word, we shall see in their gradual development and genetic unity the
   downfall of human pride, and exclaim: "What is all this art and skill
   but the manifestation of the possibilities which God has placed in
   these materials, and of the powers of mind and eye and finger which He
   has given the children of men!"

   Consider, now, personal talent as utterly distinct from art.

   The goldsmith in his craft and the judge in his office enter upon a
   work of God. Each labors in his divine vocation, and all the skill and
   judgment that he may develop therein come from the treasures of the
   Lord.

   Still, workman differs from workman, general from general. The one
   copies the product of the generation before him and bequeaths it
   without increasing the artistic skill. He began as an apprentice, and
   imparts this skill to other apprentices; but the artistic proficiency
   is the same. The other manifests something akin to genius. He quickly
   surpasses his master; sees, touches, discovers something new. In his
   hand art is enriched. It is given him to transfer from the treasures of
   divine artistic skill new beauties into human skill.

   So also of men in office and profession. Thousands of officers trained
   in our military schools become good teachers of the science of tactics
   as practised heretofore, but add nothing to it; while among these
   thousands there may be two or three possessed of military genius who in
   the event of war will astonish the world by their brilliant exploits.

   This talent, this individual genius so intimately connected with man's
   personality, is a gift. No power in the world can create it in the man
   that possesses it not. The child is born with or without it; if without
   it, no education nor severity--not even ambition--can call it forth.
   But as the gift of grace is freely bestowed by the sovereign God, so is
   also the gift of genius. When the people pray, let them not forget to
   ask the Lord to raise up among them men of talent, heroes of art and of
   office.

   When in 1870 Germany had victory only, and France defeat only, it was
   God's sovereignty that gave the former talented generals, and in
   displeasure denied them to the latter.

   Consider the vocation.

   Official and mechanical men have a high call. All have not the same
   ability. One is adapted for the sea, another for the plow. One is a
   bungler in the foundry, but a master at wood-carving, while another is
   the reverse. This depends upon the personality, nature, and
   inclination. And since the Holy Spirit lights the personality, He also
   determines every man's calling to trade or profession. The same applies
   to the life of nations. The French excel in taste as well as in
   artistic workmanship; while the English seem created for the sea, our
   masters in all the markets of the world. The Holy Spirit even bestows
   artistic skill and talent upon a nation at one time and withdraws it at
   another. Three centuries ago Holland surpassed all Europe in weaving,
   making porcelain, printing, painting, and engraving. But how great the
   subsequent decline in this respect--altho now progress again appears.

   What we find in Israel is related to this. This very thirst and
   capacity for knowledge had caused man to fall. The first impetus was
   given to artistic skill among Cain's descendants; the Jubals and the
   Jabals and the Tubal-Cains were the first artists. And yet this whole
   development, altho feeding upon the treasures of God, departed more and
   more from Him, while His own people utterly lacked it. In the days of
   Samuel there was no smith found in all the land of Canaan. Hence the
   Spirit's coming upon Bezaleel and Aholiab, upon Othniel and Samson,
   upon Saul and David; signifies something more than a mere imparting of
   artistic skill and talent; namely, the restoration of what sin had
   corrupted and defiled. And thus the illumination of a Bezaleel links
   the Holy Spirit's work in the material creation and that in the
   dispensation of grace.

  Third Chapter.

RE-CREATION.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  IX.

  Creation and Re-Creation.

   "Behold, I will pour out My Spirit unto you."--Prov. i. 23.

   We approach the special work of the Holy Spirit in Re-creation. We have
   seen that the Holy Spirit had a part in the creation of all things,
   particularly in creating man, and most particularly in endowing him
   with gifts and talents; also that His creative work affects the
   upholding of "things," of "man," and of "talents," through the
   providence of God; and that in this double series of threefold activity
   the Spirit's work is intimately connected with that of the Father and
   that of the Son, so that every thing, every man, every talent springs
   from the Father, is given disposition in their respective natures and
   being through the Son, and receives the spark of life by the Holy
   Spirit.

   The old church hymn, "Veni, Creator Spiritus," and the ancient
   confession of the Holy Spirit as the "Vivificans" agree with this
   perfectly. For the latter signifies that Person in the Trinity who
   imparts the spark of life; and the former means, "Seeing that the
   things which are to live and shall live are ready, come Holy Spirit and
   quicken them."

   There is always the same deep thought: the Father remains outside of
   the creature; the Son touches him outwardly; by the Holy Spirit the
   divine life touches him directly in his inward being.

   However, let us not be understood to say that God comes into contact
   with the creature only in the regeneration of His children, which would
   be untrue. To the Gentiles at Athens, St. Paul says "In Him we live and
   move and have our being." And again "For of His offspring we are."
   (Acts xvii. 28) To say nothing of plant or animal, there is on earth no
   life, energy, law, atom, or element but the Almighty and Omnipresent
   God quickens and supports that life from moment to moment, causes that
   energy to work, and enforces that law. Suppose that for an instant God
   should cease to sustain and animate this life, these forces, and that
   law; in that same instant they would cease to be. The energy that
   proceeds from God must therefore touch the creature in the very center
   of its being, whence, its whole existence must spring. Hence there is
   no sun, moon, nor star, no material, plant, or animal, and, in much
   higher sense, no man, skill, gift, or talent unless God touch and
   support them all.

   It is this act of coming into immediate contact with every creature,
   animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic, rational or irrational,
   that, according to the profound conception of the Word of God, is
   performed not by the Father, nor by the Son, but by the Holy Spirit.

   And this puts the work of the Holy Spirit in a light quite different
   from that in which for many years the Church has looked upon it. The
   general impression is that His work refers to the life of grace only,
   and is confined to regeneration and sanctification. This is due more or
   less to the well-known division of the Apostolic Creed by the
   Heidelberg Catechism, question 29, "How are these articles divided?"
   which is answered: "Into three parts--of God the Father and our
   creation, of God the Son and our redemption, and of God the Holy Spirit
   and our sanctification." And this, too, altho Ursinus, one of the
   authors of this catechism, had already declared, in his "Thesaurus,"
   that: "All the three Persons create and redeem and sanctify. But in
   these operations they observe this order--that the Father creates of
   Himself by means of the Son; the Son creates by means of the Father;
   and the Holy Spirit by means of both."

   But since the deeper insight into the mystery of the adorable Trinity
   was gradually lost, and the pulpit's touch upon it became both rare and
   superficial, the Sabellian error naturally crept into the Church again,
   viz., that there were three successive periods in the activities of the
   divine Persons: First, that of the Father alone creating the world and
   upholding the natural life of all things. This was followed by a period
   of activity for the Son, when nature had become unnatural and fallen
   man a subject for redemption. Lastly, came that of the Holy Spirit
   regenerating and sanctifying the redeemed on the ground of the work of
   Christ.

   According to this view, in childhood, when eating, drinking, and
   playing occupied all our time, we had to do with the Father. Later,
   when the conviction of sin dawned upon us, we felt the need of the Son.
   And not until the life of sanctification had begun in us did the Holy
   Spirit begin to take notice of us. Hence while the Father wrought, the
   Son and the Holy Spirit were inactive; when the Son undertook His work,
   the Father and the Holy Spirit were inactive; and now since the Holy
   Spirit alone performs the work, the Father and the Son are idle. But
   since this view of God is wholly untenable, Sabellius, who elaborated
   it philosophically, came to the conclusion that Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost were after all but one Person; who first wrought in creation as
   Father, then having become the Son wrought out our redemption, and now
   as the Holy Spirit perfects our sanctification.

   And yet, inadmissible as this view may be, it is more reverent and
   God-fearing than the crude superficialities of the current views that
   confine the Spirit's operations entirely to the elect, beginning only
   at their regeneration.

   True, sermons on creation referred, in passing, to the moving of the
   Holy Spirit on the face of the waters, and His coming upon Bezaleel and
   Aholiab is treated in the catechetical class; but the two are not
   connected, and the hearer is never made to understand what the Author
   of our regeneration had to do with the moving upon the waters; they
   were merely isolated facts. Regeneration was the principal work of the
   Holy Spirit.

   Our Reformed theologians have always warned against such
   representations, which are only the result of making man the
   starting-point in the contemplation of divine things. They always made
   God Himself the starting-point, and were not satisfied until the work
   of the Holy Spirit was clearly seen in all its stages, throughout the
   ages, and in the heart of every creature. Without this the Holy Spirit
   could not be God, the object of their adoration. They felt that such
   superficial treatment would lead to a denial of His personality,
   reducing Him to a mere force.

   Hence we have spared no pain, and omitted no detail, in order, by the
   grace of God, to place before the Church two distinct thoughts, viz.:

   First, The work of the Holy Spirit is not confined to the elect, and
   does not begin with their regeneration; but it touches every creature,
   animate and inanimate, and begins its operations in the elect at the
   very moment of their origin.

   Second, The proper work of the Holy Spirit in every creature consists
   in the quickening and sustaining of life with reference to his being
   and talents, and, in its highest sense, with reference to eternal life,
   which is his salvation.

   Thus we have regained the true standpoint requisite for considering the
   work of the Holy Spirit in the re-creation. For thus it appears:

   First, that this work of re-creation is not performed in fallen man
   independently of his original creation; but that the Holy Spirit, who
   in regeneration kindles the spark of eternal life, has already kindled
   and sustained the spark of natural life. And, again, that the Holy
   Spirit, who imparts unto man born from above gifts necessary to
   sanctification and to his calling in the new sphere of life, has in the
   first creation endowed him with natural gifts and talents.

   From this follows that fruitful confession of the unity of man's life
   before and after the new birth which nips every form of Methodism [9]
   in its very root, and which characterizes the doctrine of the Reformed
   churches.

   Second, it is evident that the work of the Holy Spirit bears the same
   character in creation and re-creation. If we admit that He quickens
   life in that which is created by the Father and by the Son, what does
   He do in the re-creation but once more quicken life in him that is
   called of the Father and redeemed by the Son? Again, if the Spirit's
   work is God's touching the creature's being by Him, what is re-creation
   but the Spirit entering man's heart, making it His temple, comforting,
   animating, and sanctifying it?

   Thus following the Sacred Scripture and the superior theologians, we
   reach a confession that maintains the unity of the Spirit's work, and
   makes it unite organically the natural and the spiritual life, the
   realm of nature and that of grace.

   Of course His work in the latter surpasses that in the former:

   First, since it is His work to touch the inward being of the creature,
   the more tender and natural the contact the more glorious the work.
   Hence it appears more beautiful in man than in the animal; and more
   lustrous in the spiritual man than in the natural, since the contact
   with the former is more intimate, the fellowship sweeter, the union
   complete.

   Secondly, since creation lies so far behind us and re-creation touches
   us personally and daily, the Word of God directs more attention to the
   latter, claiming for it more prominence in our confession. But, however
   different the measures of operation and of energy, the Holy Spirit
   remains in creation and re-creation the one omnipotent Worker of all
   life and quickening, and is therefore worthy of all praise and
   adoration.

  Organic and Individual.

   "Where is He that put His Holy Spirit among them?" --Isa. lxiii. 11.

   The subsequent activity of the Holy Spirit lies in the realm of grace.

   In nature the Spirit of God appears as creating, in grace as
   re-creating. We call it re-creation, because God's grace creates not
   something inherently new, but a new life in an old and degraded nature.

   But this must not be understood as tho grace restored only what sin had
   destroyed. For then the child of God, born anew and sanctified, must be
   as Adam was in Paradise before the fall. Many understand it so, and
   present it as follows: In Paradise Adam became diseased; the poison of
   eternal corruption entered his soul and penetrated his whole being. Now
   comes the Holy Spirit as the physician, carrying the remedy of grace to
   heal him. He pours the balm into his wounds, He heals his bruises and
   renews his youth; and thus man, born again, healed, and renewed, is,
   according to their view, precisely what the first man was in the state
   of rectitude. Once more the provisions of the covenant of works are
   laid upon him. By his good works he is again to inherit eternal life.
   Again he may fall like Adam and become a prey of eternal death.

   But this whole view is wrong. Grace does not place the ungodly in a
   state of rectitude, but justifies him--two very different things. He
   that stands in a state of rectitude has certainly an original
   righteousness, but this he may lose; he may be tried and fail as Adam
   failed. He must vindicate his righteousness. Its inward consistency
   must discover itself. He who is righteous to-day may be unrighteous
   to-morrow.

   But when God justifies a sinner He puts Him in a totally different
   state. The righteousness of Christ becomes his. And what is this
   righteousness? Was Jesus in a state of rectitude only? In no wise. His
   righteousness was tested, tried, and sifted; it was even tested by the
   consuming fire of God's wrath. And this righteousness converted from
   "original rectitude" into "righteousness vindicated" was imputed to the
   ungodly.

   Therefore the ungodly, when justified by grace, has nothing to do with
   Adam's state before the fall, but occupies the position of Jesus after
   the resurrection. He possesses a good that can not be lost. He works no
   more for wages, but the inheritance is his own. His works, zeal, love,
   and praise flow not from his own poverty, but from the overflowing
   fulness of the life that was obtained for him. As it is often
   expressed: For Adam in Paradise there was first work and then the
   Sabbath of rest; but for the ungodly justified by grace the Sabbath
   rest comes first, and then the labor which flows from the energies of
   that Sabbath. In the beginning the week closed with the Sabbath; for us
   the day of the resurrection of Christ opens the week which feeds upon
   the powers of that resurrection.

   Hence the great and glorious work of re-creation has two parts:

   First, the removing of corruption, the healing of the breach, the death
   to sin, the atonement for guilt.

   Second, the reversing of the first order, the changing of the entire
   state, the bringing in and establishing of a new order.

   The last is of greatest importance. For many teach differently. Altho
   they grant that a new-born child of God is not precisely what Adam was
   before the fall, yet they see the difference only in the reception of a
   higher nature. The state is the same, differing only in degree. This is
   the current theory. This nature of higher degree is called the
   "divine-human," which Christ bears in His Person, which being
   consolidated by His Passion and Resurrection is now imparted to the
   new-born soul, raising the lower and degraded nature to this higher
   life.

   This theory directly conflicts with the Scripture, which never speaks
   of conditions similar yet differing in degree and power, but of a
   condition sometimes far inferior in power and degree to that of Adam,
   but transferred into an entirely different order.

   For this reason the Scripture and the Confession of our fathers
   emphasize the doctrine of the Covenants; for the difference between the
   Covenant of Works and of Grace shows the difference between the two
   orders of spiritual things. They who teach that the new birth merely
   imparts a higher nature remain under the Covenant of Works. Theirs is
   the wearisome toil of rolling the Sisyphus stone up the mountain, even
   tho it be with the greater energy of the higher life. The Scriptural
   doctrine of Grace ends this impossible Sisyphus task; it transfers the
   Covenant of Works from our shoulders to Christ's, and opens unto us a
   new order in the Covenant of Grace in which there can be no more
   uncertainty or fear, loss or forfeit of the benefits of Christ, but of
   which Wisdom doth cry, "and Understanding putteth forth her voice,
   standing in the top of high places," (Prov. viii. 1, 2) saying that all
   things are now ready.

   The work of re-creation has this peculiarity, that it places the elect
   at once at the end of the road. They are not like the traveler still
   half way from home, but like one who has finished his journey; the
   long, dreary, and dangerous road is entirely behind him. Of course, he
   did not run that road; he could never have reached the goal. His
   Mediator and Daysman traveled it for him--and in his stead. And by
   mystic union with his Savior it is as tho he had traveled the whole
   distance; not as we reckon, but as God reckons.

   This will show why the work of the Holy Spirit appears more powerful in
   re-creation than in creation. For what is the road spoken of, but that
   which leads from the center of our degenerate hearts to the center of
   the loving heart of God? All godliness aims to bring man into communion
   with God; hence to make him travel the road between him and God. Man is
   the only being on earth in whom contact with God means conscious
   fellowship. Since this fellowship is broken by the alienation of sin,
   at the end of the road the contact and fellowship must be perfect, so
   far as concerns man's state and principle. If fellowship is the
   terminus and God's grace puts His child there at once, at least so far
   as his state is concerned, there is an obvious difference between him
   and the unregenerate; for the latter is infinitely distant from God,
   while the former has sweetest fellowship with Him. Since it is the
   inward operation of the Holy Spirit that accomplishes this, His hand
   must appear more powerful and glorious in re-creation than in creation.

   If we could see His work in re-creation all at once as an accomplished
   fact, we should understand it more thoroughly and escape the
   difficulties that we now meet in comparing the Old Testament with the
   New regarding it.

   Re-creation brings to us that which is eternal, finished, perfected,
   completed; far above the succession of moments, the course of years,
   and the development of circumstances. Here lies the difficulty. This
   eternal work must be brought to a temporal world, to a race which is in
   process of development; hence that work must make history, increasing
   like a plant, growing, blossoming, and bearing fruit. And this history
   must include a time of preparation, revelation, and lastly of filling
   the earth with the streams of grace, salvation, and blessing.

   If it did not relate to man but to irrational beings, there would be no
   difficulty; but when it began its course man was already in the world,
   and as the ages passed the stream of humanity broadened. Hence the
   important question: Whether the generations that lived during the long
   period of preparation before Christ, in whom the work of re-creation
   was finally revealed, were partakers of its blessings?

   The Scripture answers affirmatively. In the ages before Christ God's
   elect shared the blessings of the work of re-creation. Abel and Enoch,
   Noah and Abraham, Moses and David, Isaiah and Daniel were saved by the
   same faith as Peter, Paul, Luther, and Calvin. The Covenant of Grace,
   altho made with Abraham and for a time connected with the national life
   of Israel, existed already in Paradise. The theologians of the Reformed
   churches have clearly unfolded the truth, that God's elect of both
   Dispensations entered the same gate of righteousness and walked the
   same way of salvation which they still walk to the marriage-supper of
   the Lamb.

   But how could Abraham, living so many years before Christ, in whom
   alone grace and truth have been revealed, have his faith accounted unto
   him for righteousness, so that he saw the day of Jesus and was glad?

   This difficulty has confused many minds regarding the Old and New
   Dispensations, and causes many vainly to ask: How could there be any
   saving operation of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament if He were
   poured out only on Pentecost? The answer is found in the almost
   unsearchable work of the Holy Spirit, whereby, on the one hand, He
   brought into the history of our race that eternal salvation already
   finished and complete which must run through the periods of
   preparation, revelation, and fruit-bearing; and, whereby, on the other
   hand, during the preparatory period, this very preparation was made the
   means, through wondrous grace, of saving souls even before the
   Incarnation of the Word.

  XI.

  The Church Before and After Christ.

   "All these having obtained a good report through faith, received not
   the promise."Heb. xi. 39.

   Clearness requires to distinguish two operations of the Holy Spirit in
   the work of re-creation before the Advent, viz., (1) preparing
   redemption for the whole Church, and (2) regenerating and sanctifying
   the saints then living.

   If there had been no elect before Christ, so that He had no church
   until Pentecost; and if, like Balaam and Saul, the bearers of the Old
   Testament revelation had been without personal interest in Messiah,
   then it is self-evident that, before the Advent, the Holy Spirit could
   have had but one work of re-creation, viz., the preparation of the
   coming salvation. But since God had a church from the beginning of the
   world, and nearly all the bearers of the revelation were partakers of
   His salvation, the Spirit's re-creative work must consist of two parts:
   first, of the preparation of redemption for the whole Church; and,
   secondly, of the sanctification and consolation of the Old Testament
   saints.

   However, these two operations are not independent, like two separate
   water-courses, but are like drops of rain falling in the same stream of
   revelation. They are not even like two streams of different colors
   mingling in the same riverbed; for neither did the one contain anything
   for the Church of the future which had not meaning also for the saints
   of the Old Covenant; nor did the latter receive any revelation or
   commandment without significance also for the Church of the New
   Covenant. The Holy Spirit so interwove and interlaced this twofold work
   that what was the preparing of redemption for us, was at the same time
   revelation and exercise of faith for the Old Testament saints; while,
   on the other hand, He used their personal life, conflict, suffering,
   and hope as the canvas upon which He embroidered the revelation of
   redemption for us.

   Not that the revelation of old did not contain a large element that had
   a different sense and purpose for them from what it has for us. Before
   Christ, the entire service of types and shadows had significance which
   it lost immediately after the Advent. To continue it after the Advent
   would be equivalent to a denial and repudiation of His coming. One's
   shadow goes before him; when he steps into the light the shadow
   disappears. Hence the Holy Spirit performed a special work for the
   saints of God by giving them a temporary service of types and shadows.

   That this service overshadowed all their life made its impression all
   the stronger. This shadow lay upon Israel's entire history; was
   outlined in all their men from Abraham to John the Baptist; fell upon
   the judicial and political systems, and more heavily upon the social
   and domestic life; and in purest images lay upon the service of
   worship. Hence the Old Testament passages which refer to this service
   have not the meaning for us which they had for them. Every feature of
   it had a binding force for them. On the contrary, we do not circumcise
   our boys, but baptize our children; we do not eat the Passover, nor
   observe the Feast of Tabernacles, nor sacrifice the blood of bulls or
   heifers, as every discriminating reader of the Old Testament
   understands. And they who in the New Testament Dispensation seek to
   reintroduce tithing, or to restore the kingdom and the judiciary of the
   days of the Old Testament, undertake, according to past experience, a
   hopeless task: their efforts show poor success, and their whole
   attitude proves that they do not enjoy the full measure of the liberty
   of the children of God. Actually all Christians agree in this,
   acknowledging that the relation which we sustain toward the law of
   Moses is altogether different from that of ancient Israel.

   The Decalogue alone is occasionally cause of contention, especially the
   Fourth Commandment. There are still Christians who allow no difference
   between that which has a passing, ceremonial character and that which
   is perpetually ethical, and who seek to substitute the last day of the
   week for the Day of the Lord.

   However, leaving these serious differences alone, we repeat that the
   Holy Spirit had a special work in the days before Christ, which was
   intended for the saints of those days, but which has lost for us all
   its former significance.

   Not, however, that we may therefore discard this work of the Holy
   Spirit, and that the books containing these things may be left unread.
   This view has obtained currency--especially in Germany, where the Old
   Testament is less read than even the books of the Apocrypha, with the
   exception of the Psalms and a few selected pericopes. On the contrary,
   this service of shadows has even in the smallest details a special
   significance to the New Testament Church; only the significance is
   different.

   This service in the history of the Old Covenant witnesses to us the
   wonderful deeds of God, whereby of infinite mercy He has delivered us
   from the power of death and hell. In the personalities of the Old
   Covenant it reveals the wonderful work of God in implanting and
   preserving faith in spite of human depravity and Satanic opposition.
   The service of ceremonies in the sanctuary shows us the image of Christ
   and of His glorious redemption in the minutest details. And finally,
   the service of shadows in Israel's political, social, and domestic life
   reveals to us those divine, eternal, and unchangeable principles that,
   set free from their transient and temporal forms, ought to govern the
   political and social life of the Christian nations throughout all ages.

   And yet this does not exhaust the significance that this service always
   had, and still has, for the Christian Church.

   Not only does it reveal to us the outlines of the spiritual house of
   God, but it actually operated in our salvation:

   First, it prepared and preserved amid heathen idolatry a people which,
   as bearers of the divine oracles, offered the Christ at His coming a
   place for the sole of His foot and a base of operations. [10] He could
   no more have come to Athens or Rome than to China or India. No one
   there could have understood Him, or have furnished instrument or
   material to build the Church of the New Covenant. The salvation which
   was cast like a ripe fruit into the lap of the Christian Church had
   grown upon a tree deeply rooted in this service of shadows. Hence the
   history of that period is part of our own, as the life of our childhood
   and youth remains ours, even tho as men we have put away childish
   things.

   Secondly, the knowledge of this service and history, being parts of the
   Word of God, were instrumental in translating God's children from
   nature's darkness into His marvelous light.

   However, as the Holy Spirit performed special work for the saints of
   those days that has a different tho not less important significance for
   us, so also He performed a work in those days that was intended more
   directly for the Church of the New Testament, which also had a
   different but not less important significance for the saints of the Old
   Covenant. This was the work of Prophecy.

   As Christ declares, the purpose of prophecy is to predict future things
   so that, the events predicted having come to pass, the Church may
   believe and confess that it was the Lord's work. The Old Testament
   often states this, and the Lord Jesus declared it to His disciples,
   saying: "And now I have told you, before it come to pass that, when it
   is come to pass, ye might believe" (John xiv. 29). And again: "Now I
   tell you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass ye may
   believe that I am He" (John xiii. 19). And still more clearly: "But
   these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may
   remember that I told you of them." These statements, compared with the
   words of Isa. xli. 23, xlii. 9, and xliii. 19, leave no doubt as to the
   design of prophecy.

   Not that this exhausts prophecy, or that it has no other aims; but its
   chief and final end is reached only when, on the ground of its
   fulfilment, the Church believes its God and Savior and magnifies Him in
   His mighty acts.

   But while its center of gravity is the fulfilment, i.e., in the Church
   of the New Testament, it was equally intended for contemporary saints.
   For, apart from the prophetic activities that referred solely to the
   people of Israel living at that time, and the prophecies fulfilled in
   Israel's national life, prophecy even as boldly outlining Christ
   yielded precious fruit for the Old Testament saints. Connected with
   theophanies it produced in their minds such a fixed and tangible form
   of the Messiah that fellowship with Him, which alone is essential to
   salvation, was made possible to them by anticipation, as to us by
   memory. Not only did this fellowship become possible at the end of the
   Dispensation, in Isaiah and Zacharias; Christ testifies that Abraham
   desired to see His day, saw it, and was glad.

THE HOLY SCRIPTURE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.

  XII.

  The Holy Scripture.

   "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
   unto all good works."-- 2 Tim iii. 16, 17.

   Among the divine works of art produced by the Holy Spirit, the Sacred
   Scripture stands first. It may seem incredible that the printed pages
   of a book should excel His spiritual work in human hearts, yet we
   assign to the Sacred scripture the most conspicuous place without
   hesitation.

   Objectors can never have considered what this holy Book is, or any
   other book, writing, or language is, or what the putting down of a
   world of thought in a collection of Sacred Scripture means. We deny
   that a book, especially such as the Sacred Scripture, opposes a world
   of divine thought, the current of life, and spiritual experience. A
   book is not merely paper printed in ink, but is like a portrait--a
   collection of lines and features in which we see the likeness of a
   person. Standing near, we see not the person, but spots and lines of
   paint; but at the right distance these disappear and we see the
   likeness of a person. Even now it does not speak to us, for it is the
   face of a stranger; we may be able to judge the man's character, yet he
   fails to interest us. But let his child look, and instantly the image
   which left us cold appeals to him with warmth and life, which were
   invisible to us because our hearts lacked the essentials. What appeals
   to the child is not in the picture, but in his memory and imagination;
   the cooperation of the features in the painting and the father's image
   in his heart makes the likeness speak.

   This comparison will explain the mysterious effect of the Scripture.
   Guido de BrÃ¨s spoke of it in his debates with the Baptists: "That which
   we call Holy Scripture is not paper with black impressions, but that
   which addresses our spirits by means of those impressions." Those
   letters are but tokens of recognition; those words are only the clicks
   of the telegraph-key signaling thoughts to our spirits along the lines
   of our visual and auditory nerves. And the thoughts so signaled are not
   isolated and incoherent, but parts of a complete system that is
   directly antagonistic to man's thoughts, yet enters their sphere.

   Reading the Scripture brings to our minds the sphere of divine thoughts
   so far as needful for us as sinners, in order to glorify God, love our
   neighbor, and save the soul. This is not a mere collection of beautiful
   and glittering ideas, but the reflection of the divine life. In God
   life and thought are united: there can be no life without thought, no
   thought not the product of life. Not so with us. Falsehood entered us,
   i.e., we can sever thought from life. Or rather, they are always
   severed, unless we have voluntarily established the former unity. Hence
   our cold abstractions; our speaking without doing; our words without
   power; our thoughts without working; our books that, like plants cut
   off from their roots, wither before they can blossom, much less bear
   fruit.

   The difference between divine and human life gives Scripture its
   uniqueness and precludes antagonism between its letter and its spirit,
   such as a false exegesis of 2 Cor. iii. 6 might suggest. If the Word of
   God were dominated by the falsehood that has crept into our hearts, and
   in the midst of our misery continues to place word and life in
   opposition as well as separation, then we would take refuge in the
   standpoint of our dissenting brethren, with their exaltation of the
   life above the Word. But we need not do so, for the opposition and
   separation are not in the Scripture. For this reason it is the Holy
   Scripture; for it was not lost in the unholy tearing asunder of thought
   and life, and is therefore distinct from writings in which yawns the
   gulf between the words and the reality of life. What other writings
   lack is in this Book, perfect agreement between the life reflected in
   the divine thought and the thoughts which the Word begets in our minds.

   The Holy Scripture is like a diamond: in the dark it is like a piece of
   glass, but as soon as the light strikes it the water begins to sparkle,
   and the scintillation of life greets us. So the Word of God apart from
   the divine life is valueless, unworthy even of the name of Sacred
   Scripture. It exists only in connection with this divine life, from
   which it imparts life-giving thoughts to our minds. It is like the
   fragrance of a flower-bed that refreshes us only when the flowers and
   our organs of smell correspond. Hence the illustration of the child and
   his father's picture is exact.

   While the Bible always flashes thoughts born of the divine life, yet
   the effects are not the same in all. As a whole, it is the portrait of
   Him who is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of His
   Person, aiming either to show us His likeness or to serve as its
   background.

   Notice the difference when a child of God and an alien face that image.
   Not as tho it has nothing to say to the unregenerate--this is a mistake
   of Methodism which should be corrected. [11] It addresses itself to all
   men as the King's Word, and every one must receive its impress in his
   own way. But while the alien sees only a strange face, which annoys
   him, contradicts his world, and so repels him, the child of God
   understands and recognizes it. He is in holiest sympathy with the life
   of the world from which that image greets him. Thus reading what the
   stranger could not read, he feels that God is speaking to him,
   whispering peace to his soul.

   Not as tho the Scripture were only a system of signals to flash thought
   into the soul; rather it is the instrument of God to awaken and
   increase spiritual life, not as by magic, giving a sort of attestation
   of the genuineness of our experience--a fanatical view always opposed
   and rejected by the Church--but by the Holy Spirit through the use of
   the Word of God.

   He regenerates us by the Word. The mode of this operation will be
   discussed later on; let it suffice here to say that the operations of
   the Word and the Holy Spirit never oppose each other, but, as St. Paul
   declares emphatically, that the Holy Scripture is prepared by the
   Spirit of God and given to the Church as an instrument to perfect God's
   work in man; as he expresses it. "That the man of God may be perfect,"
   (2 Tim. iii. 17) i.e., a man formerly of the world, made a man of God
   by divine act, to be perfected by the Holy Spirit; wherefore he is
   already perfect in Christ through the Word. To this end, as St. Paul
   declares, the Scripture was inspired of God. Hence this work of art was
   prepared by the Holy Spirit to lead the new-born man to this high
   ideal. And to emphasize the thought he adds: "That he may be thoroughly
   furnished unto all good works." (2 Tim. iii. 17)

   Hence Scripture serves this twofold purpose:

   First, as an instrument of the Holy Spirit in His work upon a man's
   heart.

   Secondly, to qualify man perfectly and to equip him for every good
   work.

   Consequently the working of Scripture embraces not only the quickening
   of faith, but also the exercise of faith. Therefore instead of being a
   dead-letter, unspiritual, mechanically opposing the spiritual life, it
   is the very fountain of living water, which, being opened, springs up
   to eternal life.

   Hence the Spirit's preparation and preservation of Scripture is not
   subordinate, but prominent with reference to the life of the entire
   Church. Or to put it more clearly: if prophecy; e.g., aims first to
   benefit contemporary generations, and secondly to be part of the Holy
   Scripture that is to minister comfort to the Church of all ages, the
   latter is of infinitely higher importance. Hence the chief aim of
   prophecy was not to benefit the people living at that time, and through
   Scripture to yield fruit for us only indirectly, but through Scripture
   to yield fruit for the Church of all ages, and indirectly to benefit
   the Church of old.

  XIII.

  The Scripture a Necessity.

   "For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
   learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might
   have hope."--Rom. xv. 4.

   That the Bible is the product of the Chief Artist, the Holy Spirit;
   that He gave it to the Church and that in the Church He uses it as His
   instrument, can not be over-emphasized.

   Not as tho He had lived in the Church of all ages, and given us in
   Scripture the record of that life, its origin and history, so that the
   life was the real substance and the Scripture the accident; rather the
   Scripture was the end of all that preceded and the instrument of all
   that followed.

   With the dawn of the Day of days the Sacred Volume will undoubtedly
   disappear. As the New Jerusalem will need no sun, moon, or temple, but
   the Lord God will be its light, so will there be no need of Scripture,
   for the revelation of God shall reach His elect directly through the
   unveiled Word. But so long as the Church is on earth, face-to-face
   communion withheld, and our hearts accessible only by the avenues of
   this imperfect existence, Scripture must remain the indispensable
   instrument by which the Triune God prepares men's souls for higher
   glory.

   The cause of this lies in our personality. We think, we are
   self-conscious, and the threefold world about and above and within us
   is reflected in our thoughts. The man of confused or unformed
   consciousness or one insane can not act as a man. True, there are
   depths in our hearts which the plummet of our thinking has not sounded;
   but the influence that is to affect us deeply, clearly, with outlasting
   effect upon our personality, must be wrought through our
   self-consciousness.

   The history of sin proves it. How did sin enter the world? Did Satan
   infuse its poison into man's soul while he slept? By no means. While
   Eve was fully herself, Satan began to discuss the matter with her. He
   wrought upon her consciousness with words and representations, and she,
   allowing this, drank the poison, fell, and dragged her husband with
   her. Had not God thus foretold it? Man's fall was to be known neither
   by his recognized nor by his unrecognized emotions, but by the tree of
   knowledge of good and evil. The knowledge that caused his fall was not
   merely abstract, intellectual, but vital. Of course the operating cause
   was external, but it wrought upon his consciousness and bore the form
   of knowledge.

   And as his fall, so also must be his restoration. Redemption must come
   from without, act upon our consciousness, and bear the form of
   knowledge. To affect and win us in our personality we must be touched
   in the very spot where sin first wounded us, viz., in our proud and
   haughty self-consciousness. And since our consciousness mirrors itself
   in a world of thought--thoughts expressed in words so intimately
   connected as to form, as it were, but one word--therefore it was of the
   highest necessity that a new, divine world of thought should speak to
   our consciousness in a Word, i.e., in a Scripture. And this is the work
   of Holy Scripture.

   Our thought-world is full of falsehood, and so is the outer world. But
   one thought-world is absolutely true, and that is the world of God's
   thoughts. Into this world we must be brought, and it into us with the
   life that belongs to it, as brightness to light. Therefore redemption
   depends upon faith. To believe is to acknowledge that the entire world
   of thought within and around us is false, and that only God's world of
   thought is true and abiding, and as such to accept and confess it. So
   it is still the Tree of knowledge. But the fruit now taken and enjoyed
   grows upon the inward plant of self-emptying and self-denial, whereby
   we renounce our own entire world of thought, no longer judging between
   good and evil, but faithfully repeating what God teaches, as ever
   little children in His school.

   But this would not avail us if God's thoughts came in unintelligible
   words, which would have been the case if the Holy Spirit had used mere
   words. We know how hopeless it is to try to describe the felicities of
   heaven. Every effort has been so far a failure. That bliss passes our
   imagination. And the Scripture revelation concerning it is couched in
   earthly imagery--as a Paradise, a Jerusalem, or a wedding-feast--which,
   beautiful as it may be, leaves no clear impressions. We know heaven
   must be beautiful and entrancing, but a concrete conception of it is
   out of the question. Nor can we have clear ideas of the relation of the
   glorified Son of man to the Trinity, His sitting at the right hand of
   God, the life of the redeemed, and their condition when, passing from
   the chambers of death, they enter the palace of the great King.

   Hence if the Holy Spirit had presented the world of divine thoughts
   concerning our salvation in writing directly from heaven, a clear
   conception of the subject would have been impossible. Our conception
   would have been vague and figurative as that concerning heaven. Hence
   these thoughts were not directly written, but translated into the life
   of this world, which gave them form and shape; and thus they came down
   to us in human language, in the pages of a book. Without this there
   could not even be a language to embody such sacred and glorious
   realities. St. Paul had visions, i.e., he was freed from the
   limitations of consciousness and enabled to contemplate heavenly
   things; but having returned to his limitations, could not speak of what
   he had seen, as he said: "They are unspeakable."

   And that the equally unspeakable things of salvation may be rendered
   expressible in human words, it pleased God to bring to this world the
   life which originated them; to accustom our human consciousness to
   them, from it to draw words for them, and thus to exhibit them to every
   man.

   God's thoughts are inseparable from His life; hence His life must enter
   the world before His thoughts, at least at first; afterward the
   thoughts became the vehicle of the life.

   This appears in the creation of Adam. The first man is created; after
   him men are born. At first human life appeared at once in full stature;
   from that life once introduced, new life will be born. First, new life
   originated by forming Eve from Adam's rib; then, by the union of man
   and woman. So also here. At first God introduced spiritual life into
   the world, finished, perfect, by a miracle; afterward differently,
   since the thought introduced as life into this world is pictured to our
   view. Henceforth the Holy Spirit will use the product of this life to
   awaken new life.

   So redemption can not begin with the gift of Holy Scripture to the
   Church of the Old Covenant. Such Scripture could not be produced until
   its content is wrought out in life, and redemption is objectively
   accomplished.

   But the two should not be separated. Redemption was not first completed
   and then recorded in Scripture. Such conception would be mechanical and
   unspiritual, directly contradicted by the nature of Scripture, which is
   living and life-giving. Scripture was produced spontaneously and
   gradually by and from redemption. The promise in Paradise already
   foreshadowed it. For tho redemption precedes Scripture, yet in the
   regeneration of the first men the Word was not idle; the Holy Spirit
   began with speaking to man, acting upon his consciousness. Even in
   Paradise, and subsequently when the stream of revelation proceeds, a
   divine Word always precedes the life and is life's instrument, and a
   divine thought introduces redemptive work. And when redemption is
   fulfilled in Christ He appears first as the Speaker, then as the
   Worker. The Word that was from the beginning reveals Himself to Israel
   as the Seal of Prophecy, saying: "This day is this Scripture fulfilled
   in your ears." (Luke iv. 21)

   Hence the work of the Holy Spirit is never purely magical nor
   mechanical. Even in the preparatory period He always acted through the
   Word in translating a soul from death unto life. However, between then
   and now there is a decided difference:

   First, then, the Word came to the soul directly by inspiration or by a
   prophet's address. Now, both these have ceased, and in their stead
   comes the Word sealed in the Sacred Scripture, interpreted by the Holy
   Spirit in preaching in the Church.

   Secondly, then, the bringing in of life was confined to Israel,
   expressed itself in words and originated relations that strictly
   separated the servants of the only true God from the life of the world.
   Now, this extraordinary, preparatory dispensation is closed; the Israel
   of God are no more the natural descendants of Abraham, but the
   spiritual; the stream of the Church flows through all nations and
   peoples; it stands no more outside the world's life and development,
   but rather governs them.

   Thirdly, altho in the Old Dispensation redemption existed partly
   already in Scripture, and the Psalmist shows everywhere his devotion
   thereto, yet Scripture could be used so to a small extent only, and
   needed constant supplementing by direct revelations and prophecies. But
   now, Scripture reveals the whole counsel of God, and nothing can be
   added to it. Woe to him who dares diminish or increase this Book of
   Life which discloses the world of divine thought!

   But notwithstanding differences, the fact remains that the Holy Spirit
   mastered the problem of bringing to man lost in sin, by human language
   intelligible to all nations and ages, the world of divine thoughts, so
   as to use them as the instrument of man's quickening.

   It does not alter the case that the Holy Scripture shows so many seams
   and uneven places, and looks different from what we should expect. The
   chief virtue of this masterpiece was so to enfold God's thoughts in our
   sinful life that out of our language they could form a speech in which
   to proclaim through the ages, to all nations, the mighty words of God.
   This masterpiece is finished and lies before us in the Holy Scripture.
   And instead of losing itself in criticizing these apparent defects, the
   Church of all ages has received it with adoration and thanksgiving; has
   preserved it, tasted it, enjoyed it, and always believed to find
   eternal life in it.

   Not as tho critical and historical examination were prohibited. Such
   endeavor for the glory of God is highly commendable. But as the
   physiologist's search for the genesis of human life becomes sinful if
   immodest or dangerous to unborn life, so does every criticism of Holy
   Scripture become sinful and culpable if irreverent or seeking to
   destroy the life of God's Word in the consciousness of the Church.

  XIV.

  The Revelation to Which the Scripture of the Old Testament Owes Its Existence.

   "O Lord, . . . Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed."--Jer. xx.
   7.

   The understanding of the Holy Spirit's work in Scripture requires us to
   distinguish the preparation, and the formation that was the outcome of
   the preparation. We will discuss these two separately.

   The Holy Spirit prepared for Scripture by the operations which from
   Paradise to Patmos supernaturally apprehended the sinful life of this
   world, and thus raised up believing men who formed the developing
   Church.

   This will seem very foolish if we consider the Scripture a mere
   paper-book, a lifeless object, but not if we hear God speaking therein
   directly to the soul. Severed from the divine life, the Scripture is
   unprofitable, a letter that killeth. But when we realize that it
   radiates God's love and mercy in such form as to transform our life and
   address our consciousness, we see that the supernatural revelation of
   the life of God must precede the radiation. The revelation of God's
   tender mercies must precede their scintillation in the human
   consciousness. First, the revelation of the mystery of Godliness; then,
   its radiation in the Sacred Scripture, and thence into the heart of
   God's Church, is the natural and ordained way.

   For this purpose the Holy Spirit first chose individuals, then a few
   families, and lastly a whole nation, to be the sphere of His
   activities; and in each stage He began His work with the Word, always
   following the Word of Salvation with the Facts of Salvation.

   He began this work in Paradise. After the fall, death and condemnation
   reigned over the first pair, and in them entombed the race. Had the
   Spirit left them to themselves, with the germ of death ever developing
   in them, no star of hope would ever have arisen for the human race.

   Therefore the Holy Spirit introduces His work at the very beginning of
   the development of the race. The first germ of the mystery of Godliness
   was already implanted in Adam, and the first mother-word of which the
   Holy Scripture was to be born was whispered into his ear.

   This word was followed by the deed. God's word does not return void; it
   is not a sound, but a power. It is a plowshare subsoiling the soul.
   Behind the word stands the propelling power of the Holy Spirit, and
   thus it becomes effectual, and changes the whole condition of things.
   We see it in Adam and Eve; especially in Enoch; and "By faith Abel
   obtained witness that he was righteous."

   After these operations in individuals the Spirit's work in the family
   begins, partly in Noah, more especially in Abraham.

   The judgment of the flood had completely changed former relations, had
   caused a new generation to arise, and perhaps had changed the physical
   relations between the earth and its atmosphere. And then, for the first
   time, the Holy Spirit begins to work in the family. Our Ritual of
   Baptism points emphatically to Noah and his eight, which has often been
   a stumbling-block to a thoughtless unspirituality. And yet needlessly,
   for by pointing to Noah our fathers meant to indicate, in that
   sacramental prayer, that it is not the baptism of individuals, but of
   the people of God, i.e., of the Church and its seed. And since the
   salvation of families emerges first in the history of Noah and his
   family after the flood, it was perfectly correct to point to the
   salvation of Noah and his family as God's first revelation of salvation
   for us and our seed.

   But the work of the Holy Spirit in Noah's family is only preliminary.
   Noah and his sons still belong to the old world. They formed a
   transition. After Noah the holy line disappears, and from Shem to Terah
   the Holy Spirit's work remains invisible. But with Terah it appears in
   clearest light; for now Abraham goes out, not with sons, but alone. The
   promised son was still resting in the hand of God. And he could not
   beget him but by faith; so that God could truly say, "I am the Almighty
   God," i.e., a God "who quickeneth the dead and calleth the things that
   are not as tho they were." Hence Abraham's family is almost in literal
   sense the product of the Holy Spirit's work in that there is nothing in
   his life without faith. The product of art in Abraham's history is not
   the image of a pious shepherd-king or virtuous patriarch, but the
   wonderful work of the Holy Spirit operating in an old man--who again
   and again "kicks against the pricks," who brings forth out of his own
   heart nothing but unbelief--working in him a stedfast and immovable
   faith, bringing that faith into direct connection with his family life.
   Abraham is called "the Father of the Faithful," not in the superficial
   sense of a spiritual connection between our faith and Abraham's
   history, but because the faith of Abraham was interwoven with the fact
   of Isaac's birth, whom he obtained by faith, and of whom there was
   given him a seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand of the
   seashore.

   From the individual the Holy Spirit's work passes into the family, and
   thence into the nation. Thus Israel receives his being.

   It was Israel, i.e., not one of the nations, but a people newly
   created, added to the nations, received among their number, perpetually
   distinct from all other nations in origin and significance. And this
   people is also born of faith. To this end God casts it into death: on
   Moriah; in Jacob's flight; in the distresses of Joseph, and in the
   fears of Moses; alongside the fiery furnaces of Pithon and Ramses; when
   the infants of the Hebrews floated on the Nile. And from this death it
   is again and again faith that saves and delivers, and therefore the
   Holy Spirit who continues His glorious work in the generation and
   regeneration of this coming people. After this people is born it is
   again thrown into death: first, in the wilderness; then, during the
   time of the judges; finally, in the Exile. Yet it can not die, for it
   carries in its bosom the hope of the promise. However maimed, plagued,
   and decimated, it multiplies again and again; for the Lord's promise
   fails not, and in spite of shameful backslidings and apostasy, Israel
   manifests the glory of a people born, living, and dying by faith.

   Thus the work of the Holy Spirit passes through these three stages:
   Abel, Abraham, Moses; the individual, the family, the nation. In each
   of these three the work of the Holy Spirit is visible, inasmuch as
   everything is wrought by faith. Is faith not wrought by the Holy
   Spirit? Very well; by faith Abel obtained witness; by faith Abraham
   received the son of the promise; and by faith Israel passed through the
   Red Sea.

   And what is the relation between life and the word of life during these
   three stages? Is it, as according to current representations, first
   life, and then the word springing therefrom as token of the conscious
   life?

   Evidently history proves the very opposite. In Paradise the word
   precedes and the life follows. To Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, first
   the word; "Get thee out from thy country, and I will bless thee, and in
   thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed." In the case of
   Moses it is first the word in the burning bush and then the passage
   through the Red Sea. This is the Lord's appointed way. He first speaks,
   then works. Or more correctly, He speaks, and by speaking He quickens.
   These two stand in closest connection. Not as tho the word causes life;
   for the Eternal and Triune God is the only Cause, Source, and Fountain
   of life. But the word is the instrument with which He wills to complete
   His work in our hearts.

   We can not stop here to consider the work of the Father and the Son,
   which either preceded or followed that of the Holy Spirit, and which is
   interwoven with it. Of the miracles we speak only because we discover
   in them a special twofold work of the Holy Spirit. The working of the
   miracle is of the Father and of the Son, and not so much of the Holy
   Spirit. But often as it pleased God to use men as instruments in the
   performance of miracles, it is the Spirit's special work to qualify
   them by working faith in their hearts. Moses smiting the rock believed
   not, but he imagined that by smiting he himself could produce water
   from the rock; which God alone can do. To him that believes it is the
   same whether he speaks or smites the rock. Stick nor tongue can in the
   least affect it. The power proceeds from God alone. Hence the greatness
   of the sin of Moses. He thought that he was to be the worker, and not
   God. And this is the very work of sin in God's people.

   Hence we see that when Moses cast down his rod, when he cursed the
   Nile, when Elias and other men of God wrought miracles, they did
   nothing, they only believed. And by virtue of their faith they became
   to the bystanders the interpreters of God's testimony, showing them the
   works of God and not their own. This is what St. Peter exclaimed: "Why
   look ye so earnestly on us as tho by our own power or holiness we had
   made this man to walk?" (Acts iii. 12)

   To work this faith in the hearts of men who were to perform these
   miracles was the Holy Spirit's first task. His second was to quicken
   faith in the hearts of those upon whom the miracle was to be wrought.
   Of Christ it is written, that in Capernaum He could not do many
   powerful works because of their unbelief; and we read repeatedly: "Thy
   faith hath made thee whole." (Matt. ix. 22; Mark v. 34; Mark x. 52;
   Luke viii. 48; Luke xvii. 19)

   But the miracle alone has no convincing power. The unbeliever begins
   with denying it. He explains it from natural causes. He neither will
   nor can see God's hand in it. And when it is so convincing that he can
   not deny it, he says: "It is of the devil." But he will not acknowledge
   that it is the power of God. Therefore to make the miracle effectual,
   the Holy Spirit must also open the eyes of them that witness it to see
   the power of God therein. All our reading of the miracles in our Bible
   is unprofitable unless the Holy Spirit opens our eyes, and then we see
   them live, hear their testimony, experience their power, and glorify
   God for His mighty works.

  The Revelation of the Old Testament in Writing.

   "Then I said, I will not speak any more in His Name. But His word was
   in my heart as a burning fire, shut up in my bones: and I was weary
   with forbearing, but I could not."--Jer. xx. 9.

   Altho the miracles performed for and in the midst of Israel created a
   glorious life-center in the midst of the heathen world, yet they did
   not constitute a Holy Scripture; for this can not be created except God
   speak to man, even to His people Israel. "God, who at sundry times and
   in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets,
   hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son." (Heb. i. 1)

   This divine speaking is not limited to prophecy. God spoke also to
   others than prophets, e.g., to Eve, Cain, Hagar, etc. To receive a
   revelation or a vision does not make one a prophet, unless it be
   accompanied by the command to communicate the revelation to others. The
   word "nabi," the Scriptural term for prophet, does not indicate a
   person who receives something of God, but one who brings something to
   the people. Hence it is a mistake to confine the divine revelation to
   the prophetic office. In fact, it extends to the whole race in general;
   prophecy is only one of its special features. As to the divine
   revelation in its widest scope, it is evident from the Scripture that
   God spoke to men from Adam to the last of the apostles. From Paradise
   to Patmos revelation runs like a golden thread through every part of
   Sacred History.

   As a rule, the Scripture does not treat this divine speaking
   metaphorically. There are exceptions, e.g., "God spake to the fish"
   (Jonah ii. 10); "The heavens declare the glory of God, and day unto day
   uttereth speech" (Psalm xix. 2, 3). However, it can be proven, from a
   thousand passages against one to the contrary, that the ordinary
   speaking of the Lord may not be taken in other than the literal sense.
   This is evident from the call of God to Samuel, which the child mistook
   for that of Eli. It is evident also from the names, numbers, and
   localities that are mentioned in this divine speaking; especially from
   the dialogues between God and man, as in the history of Abraham in the
   conflict of his faith concerning the promised seed, and in his
   intercession for Sodom.

   And therefore we can not agree with those who would persuade us that
   the Lord did not really speak; that if it reads so, it must not be so
   understood; and that a clearer insight shows that "a certain influence
   from God affected the inner life of the person addressed. In connection
   with the person's peculiar character and the influences of his past and
   present this working gave special clearness to his consciousness, and
   wrought in him such a conviction that, without hesitation, he declared:
   Since I will as God wills, I know that the Lord has thus spoken to
   me.'" This representation we reject as exceedingly pernicious and
   hurtful to the life of the Church. We call it false, since it dishonors
   the truth of God; and we refuse to tolerate a theology that starts from
   such premises. It annihilates the authority of the Scripture. Altho
   commended by the Ethical wing it is exceedingly un-ethical, inasmuch as
   it directly opposes the clearly expressed truth of the Word of God.
   Nay, this divine speaking, whose record the Scripture offers, must be
   understood as real speaking.

   And what is speaking? Speaking presupposes a person who has a thought
   that he wishes to transfer directly to the consciousness of another,
   without the intervention of a third person or of writing or of gesture.
   Hence when God speaks to man three things are implied:

   First, that God has a thought which He wills to communicate to man.

   Second, that He executes His design in a direct way.

   Third, that the person addressed now possesses the divine thought with
   this result, that he is conscious of the same idea which a moment ago
   existed only in God.

   With every explanation doing full justice to these three points we will
   agree; every other we reject.

   As to the question whether speech is possible without sound, we answer:
   "No, not among men." Surely the Lord can speak and has spoken at times
   by means of air-vibrations; but He can speak to man without the use of
   either sound or ear. As men we have access to each other's
   consciousness only by means of the organs of sense. We can not
   communicate with our neighbor except he hear or see or feel our touch.
   The unfortunate who is devoid of these senses can not receive the
   slightest information from without. But the Lord our God is not thus
   limited. He has access to man's heart and consciousness from within. He
   can impart to our consciousness whatever He will in a direct way,
   without the use of eardrum, auditory nerve, and vibration of air. Tho a
   man be stone-deaf, God can make him hear, inwardly speaking to his
   soul.

   However, to accomplish this God must condescend to our limitations. For
   the consciousness is subject to the mental conditions of the world in
   which it lives. A negro, e.g., can have no other consciousness than
   that developed by his environment and acquired by his language.
   Speaking to a foreigner unacquainted with our tongue, we must adapt
   ourselves to his limitations and address him in his own language. Hence
   in order to make Himself intelligible to man, God must clothe His
   thoughts in human language and thus convey them to the human
   consciousness.

   To the person thus addressed it must seem therefore as tho he had been
   spoken to in the ordinary way. He received the impression that he heard
   words of human language conveying to him divine thoughts. Hence the
   divine speaking is always adapted to the capacities of the person
   addressed. Because in condescension the Lord adapts Himself to every
   man's consciousness, His speaking assumes the form peculiar to every
   man's condition. What a difference, for instance, between God's word to
   Cain and that to Ezekiel! This explains how God could mention names,
   dates, and various other details; how He could make use of the dialect
   of a certain period; of derivation of words, as in the changing of
   names, as in the case of Abraham and Sarah.

   This also shows that God's speaking is not limited to godly and
   susceptible persons prepared to receive a revelation. Adam was wholly
   unprepared, hiding himself from the presence of God. And so were Cain
   and Balaam. Even Jeremiah said: "I will not speak any more in His Name.
   But His word was in my heart as a burning fire, shut up in my bones:
   and I was weary with forbearing, but I could not" (chap. xx. 9). Hence
   the divine omnipotence is unlimited. The Lord can impart the knowledge
   of His will to whomsoever He pleases. The question why He has not
   spoken for eighteen centuries must not be answered, "Because He has
   lost the power"; but, "Because it seemeth not good to Him." Having once
   spoken and in the Scripture brought His word to our souls, He is silent
   now that we may honor the Scripture.

   However, it should be noticed that in this divine speaking from
   Paradise to Patmos there is a certain order, unity, and regularity;
   wherefore we add:

   First, the divine speaking was not confined to individuals, but, having
   a message for all the people, God spoke through His chosen prophets.
   That God can speak to a whole nation at once is proven by the events of
   Sinai. But it pleased Him not always to do this. On the contrary, He
   never spoke to them in that way afterward, but introduced prophetism
   instead. Hence the peculiar mission of prophetism is to receive the
   words of God and immediately to communicate them to the people. God
   speaks to Abraham what is for Abraham alone; but to Joel, Amos, etc., a
   message not for themselves, but for others to whom it must be conveyed.
   In connection with this we notice the fact that the prophet stands not
   alone, but in relation with a class of men among whom his mind was
   gradually prepared to speak to the people, and to receive the divine
   Oracle. For the peculiar feature of prophecy was the condition of
   ecstasy, which differed greatly from the way by which God spoke to
   Moses.

   Secondly, these divine revelations are mutually related and, taken
   together, constitute a whole. There is first the foundation, then the
   superstructure, until finally the illustrious palace of the divine
   truth and knowledge is completed. Revelation as a whole shows therefore
   a glorious plan, into which are dovetailed the special revelations to
   individuals.

   Thirdly, the speaking of the Lord, especially of the inward word, is
   peculiarly the work of the Holy Spirit, which, as we have found before,
   appears most strikingly when God comes into closest contact with the
   creature. And the consciousness is the most intimate part of man's
   being. Wherefore, as often as the Lord our God enters human
   consciousness to communicate His thoughts, clothed in human thoughts
   and speech, the Scripture and the believer honor and adore therein the
   comforting operation of the Holy Spirit.

  Inspiration.

   "And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith
   He that hath the seven Spirits of God."-- Rev. iii. 1.

   We do not speak here of the New Testament. Nothing has contributed more
   to falsify and undermine faith in the Scripture and the orthodox view
   concerning it than the unhistoric and unnatural practise of considering
   the Scripture of the Old and the New Testament at the same time.

   The Old Testament appears first; then came the Word in the flesh; and
   only after that the Scripture of the New Testament. In the study of the
   work of the Holy Spirit the same order ought to be observed. Before we
   speak of His work in the Incarnation, the inspiration of the New
   Testament may not even be mentioned. And until the Incarnation, there
   existed no other Scripture than the Old Testament.

   The question is now: How is the work of the Holy Spirit to be traced in
   the construction of that Scripture?

   We have considered the question how it was prepared. By wonderful works
   God created a new life in this world; and, in order to make men believe
   in these works, He spoke to man either directly or indirectly, i.e., by
   the prophets. But this did not create a Sacred Scripture. If nothing
   more had been done there would never have been such a Scripture; for
   events take place and belong to the past; the word once spoken passes
   away with the emotion in the consciousness.

   Human writing is the wonderful gift which God bestowed on man to
   perpetuate what otherwise would have been forgotten and utterly lost.
   Tradition falsifies the report. Among holy men this would not be so.
   But we are sinful men. By sin a lie can be told. Sin is also the cause
   of our lack of earnestness, and the root of all forgetfulness,
   carelessness, and thoughtlessness. These are the two factors, lying and
   carelessness, that rob tradition of its value. For this reason God gave
   our race the gift of writing. Whether on wax, on metal, on the face of
   the rock, on parchment, on papyrus, or on paper, is of no importance;
   but that God enabled man to find the art of committing to posterity a
   thought, a promise, an event, independent from his person, attaching it
   to something material, so that it could endure and be read by others
   even after his death--this is of greatest importance.

   For us, men, reading and writing are means of fellowship. It begins
   with speaking, which is essential to fellowship. But mere speaking
   confines it to narrow limits, while reading and writing give it wider
   scope, extending it to persons far away and to generations yet unborn.
   Through writing past generations actually live together. Even now we
   can meet with Moses and David, Isaiah and John, Plato and Cicero; we
   can hear them speak and receive their mental utterances. Writing is
   therefore no contemptible thing as some, who are overspiritual and
   sneer at the written Word, consider it. On the contrary, it is great
   and glorious--one of the mighty factors whereby God keeps men and
   generations in living communication and exercise of love. Its discovery
   was a wonderful grace, God's gift to man, more than doubling his
   treasures.

   The gift has often been abused; yet even in its rightful use there is
   ascending glory. How much more glorious appears the art of writing when
   Dante, Shakespeare, and Schiller write their poetry, than when the
   pedagogue compiles his spelling-books or the notary public scribbles
   the lease of a house!

   Since writing may be used or abused, may serve low or high purposes,
   the question arises: "What is its highest end?" And without the least
   hesitation we answer: "The writing of the Holy Scripture." As human
   speech and language are of the Holy Spirit, so is writing also taught
   us of Him. But while man uses the art to record human thoughts, the
   Holy Spirit employs it to give fixed and lasting form to the thoughts
   of God. Hence there is a human employment of it and a divine. The
   highest and wholly unique is that in the Holy Scripture.

   Actually there is no other book which sustains communication among men
   and generations as does the Sacred Scripture. To honor His own work the
   Holy Spirit has caused the universal distribution of this book alone,
   thereby putting men of all stations and classes into communication with
   the oldest generations of the race.

   From this standpoint the Holy Scripture must be considered, being in
   fact "the Scripture par excellence." Hence the divine and oft-repeated
   command: "Write." God did not only speak and act, leaving it to man
   whether His deeds and the tenor of His words were to be forgotten or
   remembered; but He also commanded that they should be recorded in
   writing. And when just before the announcement and close of the divine
   revelation to John on Patmos, the Lord commanded him, "Write to the
   church" of Ephesus, Pergamos, etc., He repeated in a summary what was
   the design of all preceding revelations, viz., that they should be
   written and in the form of a Scripture, a gift of the Holy Spirit, and
   be deposited in the Church, which for that reason is called the "pillar
   and ground of the truth." Not, according to a later interpretation, as
   tho the truth were concealed in the Church; but, according to the
   ancient rendering, that Holy Scripture was entrusted to the Church for
   preservation.

   However, we do not mean to say that with reference to every verse and
   chapter the Holy Spirit commanded, "Write," as tho the Scripture as we
   possess it had come into existence page after page. Assuredly the
   Scripture is divinely inspired: a statement distorted and perverted
   beyond recognition by our Ethical theologians, if they understand by it
   that "prophets and apostles were personally animated by the Holy
   Spirit." This confounds illumination with revelation, and revelation
   with inspiration. "Illumination" is the clearing up of the spiritual
   consciousness which in His own time the Holy Spirit gives more or less
   to every child of God. "Revelation "Is a communication of the thoughts
   of God given in extraordinary manner, by a miracle, to prophets and
   apostles. But "inspiration," wholly distinct from these, is that
   special and unique operation of the Holy Spirit whereby He directed the
   minds of the writers of the Scripture in the act of writing. "All
   Scripture is given by inspiration of God" (2 Tim. iii. 16); and this
   has no reference to ordinary illumination, nor extraordinary
   revelation, but to an operation that stands entirely alone and which
   the Church has always confessed under the name of Inspiration. Hence
   inspiration is the name of that all-comprehensive operation of the Holy
   Spirit whereby He has bestowed on the Church a complete and infallible
   Scripture. We call this operation all-comprehensive, for it was
   organic, not mechanical.

   The practise of writing dates back to remote antiquity; preceded,
   however, by the preservation of the verbal tradition by the Holy
   Spirit. This is evident from the narrative of the Creation. Noted
   physicists like Agassiz, Dana, Guyot, and others have openly declared
   that the narrative of the Creation recorded many centuries ago what so
   far no man could know of himself, and what at the present time is only
   partly revealed by the study of geology. Hence the narrative of the
   Creation is not myth, but history. The events took place as recorded in
   the opening chapters of Genesis. The Creator Himself must have
   communicated them to man. From Adam to the time when writing was
   invented the remembrance of this communication must have been preserved
   correctly. That there are two narratives of the Creation proves nothing
   to the contrary. Creation is considered from the natural and from the
   spiritual points of view; hence it is perfectly proper that the image
   of Creation should be completed in a twofold sketch.

   If Adam did not receive the special charge, yet from the revelation
   itself he obtained the powerful impression that such information was
   not designed for himself alone, but for all men. Realizing its
   importance and the obligation it imposed, succeeding generations have
   perpetuated the remembrance of God's wonderful words and deeds, first
   orally, afterward by writing. In this way there gradually arose a
   collection of documents which through Egyptian influence were put in
   book form by the great men of Israel. These documents being collected,
   sifted, compiled, and expanded by Moses, formed in his day the
   beginning of a Holy Scripture properly so called.

   Whether Moses and those earlier writers were conscious of their
   inspiration is immaterial; the Holy Spirit directed them, brought to
   their knowledge what they were to know, sharpened their judgment in the
   choice of documents and records, so that they should decide aright, and
   gave them a superior maturity of mind that enabled them always to
   choose the right word.

   Altho the Holy Spirit spoke directly to men, human speech and language
   being no human inventions, yet in writing He employed human agencies.
   But whether He dictates directly, as in the Revelation of St. John, or
   governs the writing indirectly, as with historians and evangelists, the
   result is the same: the product is such in form and content as the Holy
   Spirit designed, an infallible document for the Church of God.

   Hence the confession of inspiration does not exclude ordinary
   numbering, collecting of documents, sifting, recording, etc. It
   recognizes all these matters which are plainly discernible in
   Scripture. Style, diction, repetitions, all retain their value. But it
   must be insisted that the Scripture as a whole, as finally presented to
   the Church, as to content, selection, and arrangement of documents,
   structure, and even words, owes its existence to the Holy Spirit, i.e.,
   that the men employed in this work were consciously or unconsciously so
   controlled and directed by the Spirit, in all their thinking,
   selecting, sifting, choice of words, and writing, that their final
   product, delivered to posterity, possessed a perfect warrant of divine
   and absolute authority.

   That the Scriptures themselves present a number of objections and in
   many aspects do not make the impression of absolute inspiration does
   not militate against the other fact that all this spiritual labor was
   controlled and directed by the Holy Spirit. For the Scripture had to be
   constructed so as to leave room for the exercise of faith. It was not
   intended to be approved by the critical judgment and accepted on this
   ground. This would eliminate faith. Faith takes hold directly with the
   fulness of our personality. To have faith in the Word, Scripture must
   not grasp us in our critical thought, but in the life of the soul. To
   believe in the Scripture is an act of life of which thou, O lifeless
   man! art not capable, except the Quickener, the Holy Ghost, enable
   thee. He that caused Holy Scripture to be written is the same that must
   teach thee to read it. Without Him this product of divine art can not
   affect thee. Hence we believe:

   First, that the Holy Spirit chose this human construction of the
   Scripture purposely, that we as men might more readily live in it.

   Secondly, that these stumbling-blocks were introduced that it might be
   impossible for us to lay hold of its content with mere intellectual
   grasp, without the exercise of faith.

  Like One of Us.

   "But a body Thou hast prepared Me."-- Heb. x. 5.

   The completion of the Old Testament did not finish the work that the
   Holy Spirit undertook for the whole Church. The Scripture may be the
   instrument whereby to act upon the consciousness of the sinner and to
   open his eyes to the beauty of the divine life, but it can not impart
   that life to the Church. Hence it is followed by another work of the
   Holy Spirit, viz., the preparation of the body of Christ.

   The well-known words of Psalm xl. 6, 7: "Sacrifice and offering Thou
   didst not desire; mine ears Thou hast pierced; burnt-offering and
   sin-offering hast Thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the
   volume of the book it is written of me,"--are rendered by St. Paul:
   "Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldst not, but a body Thou hast prepared
   me; in burnt-offerings and sin-offerings Thou hast no pleasure: lo, I
   come, in the volume of the book it is written of me." (Heb. x. 5) We do
   not discuss how the words, "Mine ears hast Thou pierced," can mean
   also, "A body Thou hast prepared me." For our present purpose it is
   immaterial whether one says with Junius: "The ear is a member of the
   body; by the piercing of the ear hearing becomes possible; and only by
   the hearing does the body become an instrument of obedience"; or with
   another: "As the body of the slave became an instrument of obedience by
   the piercing of the ear, so did the body of Christ become an instrument
   of obedience by the conception of the Holy Spirit"; or finally: "As the
   Israelite became a servant by having his ear pierced, so has the
   Eternal Son adopted the form of a servant by becoming partaker of our
   flesh and blood." St. Paul's infallible exposition of Psalm xl. 7 does
   not raise any serious objection to any of these renderings. It suffices
   our present purpose if it be only acknowledged that, according to Heb.
   x. 5, the Church must confess that there was a preparation of the body
   of Christ.

   This being conceded and taken in connection with what the Gospel
   relates concerning the conception, it can not be denied that in the
   preparing of the body of the Lord there is a peculiar work of the Holy
   Spirit. For the angel said to Mary: "The Holy Ghost shall come upon
   thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also
   that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
   God" (Luke i. 35). And again: "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to
   take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of
   the Holy Ghost" (Matt. i. 20). Both passages, apart from their proper
   meanings, evidently seek to produce the impression that the conception
   and birth of Jesus are extraordinary; that they did not occur after the
   will of man, but result from an operation of the Holy Spirit.

   Like all other outgoing works of God, the preparation of the body of
   Christ is a divine work common to the three Persons.

   It is erroneous to say that the Holy Spirit is the Creator of the body
   of Jesus, or, as some have expressed it, "That the Holy Spirit was the
   Father of Christ, according to His human nature." Such representations
   must be rejected, since they destroy the confession of the Holy
   Trinity. This confession can not be maintained when any of the outgoing
   works of God are represented as not common to the three Persons.

   We wish to emphasize, therefore, that not the Holy Spirit alone, but
   the Triune God, prepared the body of the Mediator. The Father and even
   the Son cooperated in this divine act.

   However, as we have seen in Creation and Providence, in this
   cooperation the work of each Person bears its own distinctive mark.
   From the Father, of whom are all things, proceeded the material of the
   body of Christ, the creation of the human soul, and of all His gifts
   and powers, together with the whole plan of the Incarnation. From the
   Son, who is the wisdom of the Father, disposing and arranging all
   things in Creation, proceeded the holy disposition and arrangement with
   reference to the Incarnation. And as the correlated acts of the Father
   and the Son in Creation and Providence receive animation and perfection
   through the Holy Spirit, so there is in the Incarnation a peculiar act
   of the Holy Spirit through which the acts of Father and Son in this
   mystery receive completion and manifestation. Therefore it is said in
   Heb. x. 7 of the Triune God: "A body Thou hast prepared Me"; while it
   is also declared that that which is conceived in Mary is of the Holy
   Ghost.

   This, however, may not be explained in the ordinary sense. It might be
   said that there is nothing wonderful in this, for Job declares (chap.
   xxxiii. 4), "The Spirit of the Lord hath given me life," and of Christ
   we read that He was born of Mary, being conceived by the Holy Ghost.
   These two cover the same ground. Both instances connect the birth of a
   child with an act of the Holy Spirit. While, as regards the birth of
   Christ, we do not deny this ordinary act of the Holy Spirit, which is
   essential to the quickening of all life, especially that of a human
   being, yet we do deny that the conception by the Holy Spirit was the
   ordinary act. The ancient confession, "I believe in Jesus Christ, His
   Only-Begotten Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,"
   refers to a divine miracle and a deep mystery, in which the work of the
   Holy Spirit must be glorified.

   Accordingly a complete analysis of this work is impossible. If not, it
   would cease to be a miracle. Wherefore let us look into this matter
   only with deepest reverence, and not advance theories contrary to the
   Word of God. What God has been pleased to reveal we know; what His Word
   only hints we can know only in faint outlines; and what is advanced
   outside of the Word is only the effort of a meddlesome spirit or
   unhallowed curiosity.

   In this work of the Holy Spirit two things must be distinguished:

   First, the creation of the human nature of Jesus.

   Secondly, His separation from sinners.

   On the first point, the Scripture teaches that no man ever could claim
   paternal connection with Jesus. Joseph appears and acts as the
   stepfather of Christ; but of a fellowship of life and origin between
   him and Jesus the Scripture never speaks. Indeed, Joseph's neighbors
   regarded Jesus as the Son of the carpenter, but the Scripture always
   treats this as an error. St. John, declaring that the children of God
   are born not of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of
   God, undoubtedly borrowed this glorious description of our higher birth
   from the extraordinary act of God which scintillates in the conception
   and birth of Christ. The fact that Mary was called a virgin; that
   Joseph was troubled at the discovery of his bride's condition; that he
   intended secretly to leave her, and that an angel appeared to him in a
   dream--in a word, the whole Gospel narrative, as well as the unbroken
   tradition of the Church, allows no other confession than that the
   conception and birth of Christ were of Mary the virgin, but not of
   Joseph her betrothed husband.

   Excluding the man, the Scripture thrice puts the Holy Spirit in the
   foreground as the Author of the conception. St. Matthew says (chap.
   i.18): "When Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came
   together, she was found with child by the Holy Ghost." And again, in
   ver. 20: "For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."
   Lastly, Luke says (chap. i. 35): "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
   and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that
   holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
   These clear statements do not receive full recognition unless it be
   plainly confessed that the conception of the germ of a human nature in
   the womb of the virgin was an act of the Holy Spirit.

   It is not expedient nor lawful to enter more deeply into this matter.
   How human life originates after conception, whether the embryo
   immediately contains a human person or, whether he is created therein
   afterward, and other similar questions, must remain unanswered, perhaps
   forever. We may advance theories, but Omnipotent God allows no man to
   discover His workings in hidden laboratories of His creative power.
   Wherefore all that may be said according to Scripture is contained in
   the following four particulars:

   First, in the conception of Christ not a new being was called into life
   as in all other cases, but One who had existed from eternity, and who
   then entered into vital relation with the human nature. The Scripture
   clearly reveals this. Christ existed from before the foundation of the
   world. His goings forth were of old, from the days of eternity. He took
   upon Himself the form of a servant. Even tho the biologist should
   discover the mystery of the human birth, it could not reveal anything
   regarding the conception of the Mediator.

   Second, it is not the conception of a human person, but of a human
   nature. Where a new being is conceived, a human person comes into
   existence. But when the Person of the Son, who was with the Father from
   eternity, partakes of our flesh and blood, He adopts our human nature
   in the unity of His Person, thus becoming a true man; but it is not the
   creation of a new person. The Scripture clearly shows this. In Christ
   appears but one ego, being in the same Person at once the Son of God
   and the Son of man.

   Third, from this it follows not that a new flesh was created in Mary as
   the Mennonites used to teach, but that the fruit in Mary's womb, from
   which Jesus was born, was taken from and nourished with her own
   blood--the very blood which through her parents she had received from
   fallen Adam.

   Last, the Mediator born of Mary not only partook of our flesh and
   blood, such as it existed in Adam and as we have inherited it from
   Adam, but He was born a true man, thinking, willing, and feeling like
   other men, susceptible to all the human emotions and sensations that
   cause the countless thrills and throbs of human life.

   And yet He was separate from sinners. Of this we speak in the next
   article.

   Let this suffice for the fact of the conception, from which fact we
   derive the precious comfort: "That it covers in the sight of God my sin
   and guilt wherein I was conceived and brought forth" (Heidelberg
   Catechism, quest. 36).

  Guiltless and Without Sin.

   "For such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,
   separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens."--Heb. vii.
   26.

   Throughout the ages the Church has confessed that Christ took upon
   Himself real human nature from the virgin Mary, not as it was before
   the fall, but such as it had become, by and after the fall.

   This is clearly stated in Heb. ii. 14, 17: "Forasmuch as the children
   are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself took part of the same
   . . . . Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto
   His brethren, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people." It
   was even such a partaking of our nature as would make Him feel Satan's
   goad, for there follows: "In that He Himself hath suffered, being
   tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted." Upon the
   authority of the divine Word we can not doubt then that the Son of God
   became man in our fallen nature. It is our misery, by virtue of the
   inherited guilt of Adam, that we can not live and act but as partakers
   of the flesh and blood corrupted by the fall. And since we as children
   are partakers of flesh and blood, so is He also become partaker of the
   same. Hence it can not be too strongly emphasized that the Son of God,
   walking among men, bore the same nature in which we spend our lives;
   that His flesh had the same origin as our flesh; that the blood which
   ran through His veins is the same as our blood, and came to Him as well
   as to us from the same fountain in Adam. We must feel, and dare
   confess, that in Gethsemane our Savior agonized in our flesh and blood;
   that it was our flesh and blood that were nailed to the cross. The
   "blood of reconciliation" is taken from the very blood which thirsts
   after reconciliation.

   With equal assurance, however, bowing to the authority of the
   Scripture, we confess that this intimate union of the Son of God with
   the fallen human nature does not imply the least participation of our
   sin and guilt. In the same epistle in which the apostle sets forth
   distinctly the fellowship of Jesus with the human flesh and blood, he
   bears equally clear testimony to the fact of His sinlessness, so that
   every misunderstanding may be obviated. As by virtue of our conception
   and birth we are unholy, guilty, and defiled, one with sinners, and
   therefore burdened with the condemnation of hell, so is the Mediator
   conceived and born holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,
   made higher than the heavens. And with equal emphasis the apostle
   declares that sin did not enter into His temptations, for, altho
   tempted in all things, like as we are, yet He was ever without sin.

   Therefore the mystery of the Incarnation lies in the apparent
   contradiction of Christ's union with our fallen nature, which on the
   one hand is so intimate as to make Him susceptible to its temptations,
   while on the other hand He is completely cut off from all fellowship
   with its sin. The confession which weakens or eliminates either of
   these factors must, when logically developed, degenerate into serious
   heresy. By saying, "The Mediator is conceived and born in our nature,
   as it was before the fall," we sever the fellowship between Him and us;
   and by allowing that He had the least personal part of our guilt and
   sin, we sever His fellowship with the divine nature.

   Does the Scripture not teach then that the Mediator was made sin and
   bore the curse for us, and "as a worm and no man" suffered deepest
   distress?

   We answer: Yea, verily, without this we could have no redemption. But
   in all this He acted as our Substitute. His own personality was not in
   the least affected by it. His burdening Himself with our sins was a
   High-Priestly act, performed vicariously. He was made sin, but never a
   sinner. Sinner means one who is personally affected by sin; Christ's
   person never was. He never had any fellowship with sin other than that
   of love and compassion, to bear it as our High Priest and Substitute.
   Yet, tho He was exceedingly sorrowful even unto death, tho He was
   sorely tempted so that He cried out, "Let this cup pass from Me," in
   the center of His personal being He remained absolutely free from the
   least contact with sin.

   A close examination of the way by which we become partakers of sin will
   shed more light on this subject.

   Every individual sin is not of our own begetting only, but a
   participation in the common sin, the one mighty sin of the whole race
   against which the anger of God is kindled. Not only do we partake of
   this sin by an act of the will as we grow up; it was ours already in
   the cradle, in our mother's womb--yea, even in our conception.
   "Conceived and born in sin" is the awful confession which the Church of
   God's redeemed can never deny.

   For this reason the Church has always laid such stress upon the
   doctrine of inherited guilt, as declared by St. Paul in Rom. v. Our
   inherited guilt does not spring from inherited sin; on the contrary, we
   are conceived and born in sin because we stand in inherited guilt.
   Adam's guilt is imputed to all that were in his loins. Adam lived and
   fell as our natural and federal head. Our moral life stands in
   root-relation to his moral life. We were in him. He carried us in
   himself. His state determined our state. Hence by the righteous
   judgment of God his guilt was imputed to all his posterity, for as much
   as, by the will of man, they should successively be born of his loins.
   By virtue of this inherited guilt we are conceived in sin and born in
   the participation of sin.

   God is our Creator, and from His hands we came forth pure and
   undefiled. To teach otherwise is to make Him the Author of individual
   sin, and to destroy the sense of guilt in the soul. Hence sin,
   especially original sin, does not originate in our creation by the hand
   of God, but by our vital relation with the sinful race. Our person does
   not proceed from our parents. This is in direct conflict with the
   indivisibility of spirit, with the Word of God, and its confession that
   God is our Creator, "who has also made me."

   However, all creation is not the same. There is mediate and immediate
   creation. God created light by immediate creation, but grass and herbs
   mediately, for they spring from the ground. The same difference exists
   between the creation of Adam and that of his posterity. The creation of
   Adam was immediate: not of his body, which was taken from the dust, but
   of his person, the human being called Adam. His posterity, however, is
   a mediate creation, for every conception is made to depend upon the
   will of man. Hence while we come from the hand of God pure and
   undefiled, we become at the same time partakers of the inherited and
   imputed guilt of Adam; and by virtue of this inherited guilt, through
   our conception and birth, God brings us into fellowship with the sin of
   the race. How this is brought about is an unfathomable mystery but this
   is a fact, that we become partakers of the sin of the race by
   generation, which begins with conception and ends with birth.

   And now, with reference to the Person of Christ, everything depends
   upon the question whether the original guilt of Adam was imputed also
   to the man Jesus Christ.

   If so, then, like all other men, Christ was conceived and born in sin
   by virtue of this original guilt. Where imputed original guilt is,
   there must be sinful defilement. But, on the other hand, where it is
   not, sinful defilement can not be; hence He that is called holy and
   harmless must be undefiled. Adam's guilt was not imputed to the man
   Jesus Christ. If it were, then He was also conceived and born in sin;
   then He did not suffer vicariously, but for Himself personally; then
   there can be no blood of reconciliation. If the original guilt of Adam
   was imputed to the man Jesus Christ, then by virtue of His sinful
   conception and birth He was also subject to death and condemnation, and
   He could not have received life but by regeneration. Then it also
   follows that either this Man is Himself in need of a Mediator, or that
   we, like Him, can enter into life without a Go-between.

   But this whole representation is without foundation, and is to be
   rejected without qualification. The whole Scripture opposes it. Adam's
   guilt is imputed to his posterity. But Christ is not a descendant of
   Adam. He existed before Adam. He was not born passively as we, but
   Himself took upon Him the human flesh. He does not stand under Adam as
   His head, but is Himself a new Head, having others under Him, of whom
   He saith: "Behold Me and the children whom Thou hast given Me" (Heb.
   ii. 13). True, Luke iii. 23, 28 contains the genealogy of Joseph, which
   closes with the words, "The son of Adam, the son of God"; but the
   Evangelist adds emphatically, "as was supposed"; hence Jesus was not
   the son of Joseph. And in Matthew His genealogy stops at Abraham. Altho
   on Pentecost St. Peter says that David knew that God would raise up
   Christ out of the fruit of his loins, yet he adds this limitation,
   "according to the flesh." Moreover, realizing that the Son did not
   assume a human person, but the human nature, so that His Ego is that of
   the Person of the Son of God, it necessarily follows that Jesus can not
   be a descendant of Adam; hence the imputation of Adam's guilt to Christ
   would annihilate the divine Person. Such imputation is utterly out of
   the question. To Him nothing is imputed. The sins He bore He took upon
   Himself voluntarily, vicariously, as our High Priest and Mediator.

  The Holy Spirit in the Mystery of the Incarnation.

   "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His
   glory."--John i. 14.

   There is one more question in the treatment of this subject: What was
   the extraordinary operation of the Holy Spirit that enabled the Son of
   God to assume our fallen nature without being defiled by sin?

   Altho we concede it to be unlawful to pry into that behind the veil
   which God does not freely open to us, yet we may seek the meaning of
   the words that embody the mystery; and this we intend to do in the
   discussion of this question.

   The Incarnation of Christ, with reference to His sinlessness, is
   connected with the being of sin, the character of original sin, the
   relation between body and soul, regeneration, and the working of the
   Holy Spirit in believers. Hence it is necessary for a clear
   understanding to have a correct view of the relation of Christ's human
   nature to these important matters.

   Sin is not a spiritual bacillus hiding in the blood of the mother and
   received into the veins of the child. Sin is not material and tangible;
   its nature is moral and spiritual, belonging to the invisible things
   whose results we can perceive but whose real being escapes detection.
   Wherefore in opposition to Manicheism and kindred heresies, the Church
   has always confessed that sin is not a material substance in our flesh
   and blood, but that it consists in the loss of the original
   righteousness in which Adam and Eve bloomed and prospered in Paradise.
   Nor do believers differ on this point, for all acknowledge that sin is
   the loss of original righteousness.

   However, tracing the next step in the course of sin, we meet a serious
   difference between the Church of Rome and our own. The former teaches
   that Adam came forth perfect from the hand of his Maker, even before he
   was endowed with original righteousness. This implies that the human
   nature is finished without original righteousness, which is put on him
   like a robe or ornament. As our present nature is complete without
   dress or ornament, which are needed only to appear respectable in the
   world, so was the human nature, according to Rome, complete and perfect
   in itself without righteousness, which serves only as dress and jewel.
   But the Reformed churches have always opposed this view, maintaining
   that original righteousness is an essential part of the human nature;
   hence that the human nature in Adam was not complete without it; that
   it was not merely added to Adam's nature, but that Adam was created in
   the possession of it as the direct manifestation of his life.

   If Adam's nature was perfect before he possessed original
   righteousness, it follows that it remains perfect after the loss of it;
   in which case we describe sin simply as "carentia justitix
   origirialis;" i.e., the want of original righteousness. This used to be
   expressed thus: Is original righteousness a natural or supernatural
   good? If natural, then its loss caused the human nature to be wholly
   corrupt; if supernatural, then its loss might take away the glory and
   honor of that nature, but as a human nature it retained nearly all of
   its original power.

   Bellarminus said that desire, disease, conflict, etc., naturally belong
   to human nature; and original righteousness was a golden bridle laid
   upon this nature, to check and control this desire, disease, conflict,
   etc. Hence when the golden bride was lost, disease, desire, conflict,
   and death broke loose from restraint (tom. iv., chap. v., col. 15, 17,
   18). Thomas Aquinas, to whom Calvin was greatly indebted, and whom the
   present Pope has earnestly commended to his priests, had a more correct
   view. This is evident from his definition of sin. If disease, desire,
   etc., existed in man when he came from the hand of God, and only
   supernatural grace can restrain them, then sin is merely the loss of
   original righteousness, hence purely negative. But if original
   righteousness belongs to human nature and was not simply added to it
   supernaturally, then sin is twofold: first, the loss of original
   righteousness; second, the ruin and corruption of human nature itself,
   disorganizing and disjointing it. Thomas Aquinas acknowledges this last
   aspect, for he teaches ("Summa TheologiÃ¦," prima secundÃ¦, ix., sect. 2,
   art. 1) that sin is not only deprivation and loss, but also a state of
   corruption, wherein must be distinguished the lack of what ought to be
   present, i.e., original righteousness, and the presence of what ought
   to be absent, viz., an abnormal derangement of the parts and powers of
   the soul.

   Our fathers held almost the same view. They judged that sin is not
   material, but the loss of original righteousness. But since original
   righteousness belongs to the sound human nature, the loss did not leave
   that nature intact, but damaged, disjointed, and corrupted it.

   To illustrate: A beautiful geranium that adorned the window was killed
   by the frost. Leaves and flowers withered, leaving only a mass of
   mildew and decay. What was the cause? Merely the loss of the sun's
   light and heat. But that was enough; for these belong to the nature of
   the plant, and are essential to its life and beauty. Deprived of them
   it remains not what it is, but its nature loses its soundness, and this
   causes decay, mildew, and poisonous gases, which soon destroy it. So of
   human nature: In Paradise Adam was like the blooming plant, flourishing
   in the warmth and brightness of the Lord's presence. By sin he fled
   from that presence. The result was not merely the loss of light and
   heat, but since these were essential to his nature, that nature
   languished, drooped, and withered. The mildew of corruption formed upon
   it; and the positive process of dissolution was begun, to end only in
   eternal death.

   Facts and history prove even now that the human body has weakened since
   the days of the Reformation; that bad habits of a certain character
   sometimes pass from father to child even where the early death of the
   former precludes propagation by education and example. Hence the
   difference between Adam, body and soul, before the fall and his
   descendants after the fall is not merely the loss of the Sun of
   Righteousness, which by nature shines no longer upon them, but the
   damage caused by this loss to the human nature, in body and soul, which
   thereby are weakened, diseased, corrupted, and thrown out of balance.

   This corrupt nature passes from the father to the child, as the
   Confession of Faith expresses it in article xv.: "That original sin is
   a corruption of the whole nature, and an hereditary disease, wherewith
   infants themselves are infected in their mother's womb, and which
   produces in man all sorts of sin, being in him as a root thereof."

   However, the relation between a person and his ego must be taken into
   account. The disordered condition of our flesh and blood inclines and
   incites to sin, a fact that has been observed in the victims of certain
   terrible diseases as their effect. But this could not result in sin if
   there were no personal ego to allow itself to be excited. Again, tho
   the unbalanced powers of the soul which cause the darkening of the
   understanding, the blunting of the sensibilities, and the weakening of
   the will arouse the passions, yet even this could not result in sin if
   no personal ego were affected by this working. Hence sin puts its own
   mark upon this corruption only when the personal ego turns away from
   God, and in that disordered soul and diseased body stands condemned
   before Him.

   If according to established law the unclean brings forth the unclean,
   and if God has made our birth to depend upon generation by sinful men,
   it must follow that by nature we are born--first, without original
   righteousness; secondly, with an impaired body; thirdly, with a soul
   out of harmony with itself; lastly, with a personal ego which is turned
   away from God.

   All of which would apply to the Person of the Mediator if, like one of
   us, He had been born a human person by the will of man and not of God.
   But since He was not born a human person, but took our human nature
   upon Himself, and was conceived not by the will of man, but by an
   operation of the Holy Spirit, there could not be in Him an ego turned
   away from God, nor could the weakness of His human nature for a moment
   be a sinful weakness. Or to put it in the concrete: Altho there was in
   that fallen nature something to incite Him to desire, yet it never
   became desire. There is a difference between the temptations and
   conflicts of Jesus and those of ourselves; while our ego and nature
   desire against God, His holy Ego opposed the incitement of His adopted
   nature and was never overcome.

   Hence the proper work of the Holy Spirit consisted in this:

   First, the creation not of a new person, but of a human nature, which
   the Son assumed into union with His divine nature in one Person.

   Second, that the divine-human Ego of the Mediator, who, according to
   His human nature, also possessed spiritual life, was kept from the
   inward defilement which by virtue of our birth affected our ego and
   personality.

   Hence regeneration, which affects not our nature but our person, is out
   of the question with reference to Christ. But what Christ needed was
   the gifts of the Holy Ghost to enable His weakened nature, in
   increasing measure, to be His instrument in the working out of His holy
   design; and finally to transform His weakened nature not by
   regeneration, but by resurrection into a glorious nature, divested of
   the last trace of weakness and prepared to unfold its highest glory.

  The Holy Spirit in the Mediator.

   "Who through the Eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to
   God."--Heb. ix. 14.

   The work of the Holy Spirit in the Person of Christ is not exhausted in
   the Incarnation, but appears conspicuously in the work of the Mediator.
   We consider this work in the development of His human nature; in the
   consecration to His office; in His humiliation unto death; in His
   resurrection, exaltation, and return in glory.

   First--The work of the Holy Spirit in the development of the human
   nature in Jesus.

   We have said before, and now repeat, that we consider the effort to
   write the "Life of Jesus" either unlawful or its title a misnomer: a
   misnomer when, pretending to write a biography of Jesus, the writer
   simply omits to explain the psychological facts of His life; unlawful
   when he explains these facts from the human nature of Jesus.

   There never was a life of Jesus in the sense of a human, personal
   existence; and the tendency to substitute the various biographies of
   Jesus of Nazareth for the simple Gospel narratives aims really at
   nothing else than to place the unique Person of the God-man on the same
   level with the geniuses and great men of the world; to humanize Him,
   and thus to annihilate the Messiah in Him--in other words, to
   secularize Him. And against this we solemnly protest with all the power
   that is in us.

   The God-human Person of the Lord Jesus did not live a life, but
   rendered one mighty act of obedience by humbling Himself unto death;
   and out of that humbling He ascended not by powers developed from His
   human nature, but by a mighty and extraordinary act of the power of
   God. Any one who successfully undertook to write the life of Christ
   could do no more than draw the picture of His human nature. For the
   divine nature has no history, does not run through a process of time,
   but remains the same forevermore.

   However, this does not prevent us from inquiring, according to the need
   of our limitations, in what manner the human nature of Christ was
   developed. And then the Scripture teaches us that there was indeed
   growth in His human nature. St. Luke relates that Jesus increased in
   wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men. Hence there was in
   His human nature a growth and development from the less unto the
   greater. This would have been impossible if in the Messiah the divine
   nature had taken the place of the human ego; for then the majesty of
   the Godhead would always and completely have filled the human nature.
   But this was not the case. The human nature in the Mediator was real,
   i.e., in body and soul it existed as it exists in us, and all inworking
   of divine life, light, and power could manifest itself only by adapting
   itself to the peculiarities and limitations of the human nature.

   When maintaining the mistaken view that the development of sinless Adam
   would have been accomplished without the aid of the Holy Spirit, it is
   natural to suppose that the sinless nature of Christ did equally
   develop itself without the assistance of the Spirit of God. But knowing
   from the Scripture that not only man's gifts, powers, and faculties,
   but also their working and exercise are a result of the work of the
   Holy Spirit, we see the development of the human nature of Jesus in a
   different light and understand the meaning of the words that He
   received the Holy Spirit without measure. For this indicates that His
   human nature also received the Holy Ghost; and not this only after He
   had lived for years without Him, but every moment of His existence
   according to the measure of His capacities. Even in His conception and
   birth the Holy Spirit effected not only a separation from sin, but He
   also endowed His human nature with the glorious gifts, powers, and
   faculties of which that nature is susceptible. Hence His human nature
   received these gifts, powers, and faculties not from the Son by
   communication from the divine nature, but from the Holy Ghost by
   communication to the human nature; and this should be thoroughly
   understood.

   However, His human nature did not receive these gifts, powers, and
   faculties in full operation, but wholly inoperative: As there are in
   every infant powers and faculties that will remain dormant, some of
   them for many years, so there were in the human nature of Christ powers
   and faculties which for a time remained slumbering. The Holy Spirit
   imparted these endowments to His human nature without measure--John
   iii. 34. This has reference to a contrast between others, whom the Holy
   Spirit endowed not without measure, but in limited degree according to
   their individual calling or destiny; and Christ, in whom there is no
   such distinction or individuality--to whom, therefore, gifts, powers,
   and faculties are imparted in such a measure that He never could feel
   the lack of any gift of the Holy Spirit. He lacked nothing, possessed
   all; not by virtue of His divine nature, which can not receive
   anything, being the eternal fulness itself, but by virtue of His human
   nature, which was endowed with such glorious gifts by the Holy Spirit.

   However, this was not all. Not only did the Holy Spirit adorn the human
   nature of Christ with these endowments, but He also caused them to be
   exercised, gradually to enter into full activity.

   This depended upon the succession of the days and years of the time of
   His humiliation. Altho His heart contained the germ of all wisdom, yet
   as a child of one year, e.g., He could not know the Scripture by means
   of His human understanding. As the Eternal Son He knew it, for He
   Himself had given it to His Church. But His human knowledge had no free
   access to His divine knowledge. On the contrary, while the latter never
   increased, knowing all things from eternity, the former was to learn
   everything; it had nothing of itself. This is the increase in wisdom of
   which St. Luke speaks--an increase not of the faculty, but of its
   exercise. And this affords us a glimpse into the extent of His
   humiliation. He that knew all things by virtue of His divine nature
   began as man with knowing nothing; and that which He knew as a man He
   acquired by learning it under the influence of the Holy Spirit.

   And the same applies to His increase in stature and in favor with God
   and men. Stature refers to His physical growth, including all that in
   the human nature depends upon it. Not created an adult like Adam, but
   born a child like each of us, Jesus had to grow and develop physically:
   not by magic, but in reality. When He lay in Mary's lap, or as a boy
   looked around in his stepfather's shop, He was a child not only in
   appearance with the wisdom of a venerable, hoary head, but a real
   child, whose impressions, feelings, sensations, and thoughts kept step
   with His years. No doubt His development was quick and beautiful,
   surpassing anything ever seen in other children, so that the aged
   rabbis in the Temple were astonished when they looked upon the Boy only
   twelve years old; yet it always remained the development of a child
   that first lay upon His mother's lap, then learned to walk, gradually
   became a boy and youth, until He attained the fulness of man's stature.

   And as the Holy Spirit with every increase of His human nature enlarged
   the exercise of its powers and faculties, so He did also with reference
   to the relation of the human nature to God and men, for He increased in
   favor with God and men. Favor has reference to the unfolding and
   development of the inward life, and may manifest itself in a twofold
   way, either pleasing or displeasing to God and men. Of Jesus it is said
   that in His development such gifts and faculties, dispositions and
   attributes, powers and qualifications manifested themselves from the
   inward life of His human nature that God's favor rested upon them,
   while they affected those around Him in a refreshing and helpful way.

   Even apart from His Messiahship Jesus stood, with reference to His
   human nature, during all the days of His humiliation, under the
   constant and penetrating operation of the Holy Spirit. The Son, who
   lacked nothing, but as God in union with the Father and the Holy Spirit
   possessed all things, compassionately adopted our human nature. And
   inasmuch as it is the peculiarity of that nature to derive its gifts,
   powers, and faculties not from itself, but from the Holy Spirit, by
   whose constant operation alone they can be exercised, so did the Son
   not violate this peculiarity, but, altho He was the Son, He did not
   take its preparation, enriching, and operation into His own hand, but
   was willing to receive them from the hand of the Holy Spirit.

   The fact that the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus at His Baptism,
   altho He had received Him without measure at His conception, can only
   be explained by keeping in view the difference between the personal and
   official life of Jesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Not Like unto Us.

   "Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness."--Matt. iv.
   1.

   The representation that Christ's human nature received animating and
   qualifying influences and impulses directly from His divine nature,
   altho on the whole incorrect, contains also some truth.

   We often distinguish between our ego and nature. We say: "I have my
   nature against me," or "My nature is in my favor"; hence it follows
   that our person animates and actuates our nature. Applying this to the
   Person of the Mediator, we must distinguish between His human nature
   and His Person. The latter existed from eternity, the former He adopted
   in time. And since in the Son the divine Person and the divine nature
   are nearly one, it must be acknowledged that the Godhead of our Lord
   directly controlled His human nature. This is the meaning of the
   confession of God's children that His Godhead supported His human
   nature.

   But it is wrong to suppose that the divine Person accomplished in His
   human nature what in us is effected by the Holy Spirit. This would
   endanger His true and real humanity. The Scripture positively denies
   it.

   Second--The work of the Holy Spirit in the consecration of Jesus to His
   office (see "First," on p. 93).

   This ought to be carefully noticed, especially since the Church has
   never sufficiently confessed the influence of the Holy Spirit exerted
   upon the work of Christ. The general impression is that the work of the
   Holy Spirit begins when the work of the Mediator on earth is finished,
   as tho until that time the Holy Spirit celebrated His divine day of
   rest. Yet the Scripture teaches us again and again that Christ
   performed His mediatorial work controlled and impelled by the Holy
   Spirit. We consider this influence now with reference to His
   consecration to His office.

   By the spirit of the prophets already Christ testified of this saving
   by the mouth of Isaiah: "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me,
   because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the
   meek." But the great fact which could not be learned from prophecy is
   that of the descent of the Holy Spirit at Jordan. Surely Isaiah
   referred partly to this event, but principally to the anointing in the
   counsel of peace. However, when Jesus went up out of Jordan, and the
   Holy Spirit descended upon Him like a dove, and a voice was heard from
   heaven saying, "This is My beloved Son," then only the anointing became
   actual.

   In regard to the event itself, only a few words. That Christ's Baptism
   was not a mere form, but the fulfilling of all righteousness proves
   that He descended into the water burdened with our sins. Hence St. John
   makes the words, "Behold the Lamb of God," (John i. 29) precede the
   account of His Baptism. Wherefore it is incorrect to say, that Christ
   was installed into His Messianic office only at His Baptism. On the
   contrary, He was anointed from eternity. Wherefore He may not be
   represented as being for a moment unconscious, according to the measure
   of His development, of the Messiah task that rested upon Him. This lay
   in His holy Person; it was not added to Him at a later period, but was
   His before Adam fell. And as in His human consciousness His Person
   gradually attained stature, it was always the stature of the Messiah.
   This is evident from His answer when, at the age of twelve, He spoke of
   the things of His Father which were to occupy Him; and still more
   clearly from His words to John the Baptist commandingly saying: "Suffer
   it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness."

   And yet it is only at His Baptism that Jesus receives the actual
   consecration to His office. This is proven from the fact that
   immediately after this He entered publicly upon His office as a
   Teacher; and also from the event itself, and the voice from heaven
   pointing to Him as the Messiah; and especially from the descent of the
   Holy Spirit, which can not be interpreted in any other way than as His
   consecration to His holy office.

   What we have said with reference to the communication of the Holy
   Spirit qualifying one for office, as in the case of Saul, David, and
   others, is of direct application here. Altho in His human nature Jesus
   was personally in constant fellowship with the Holy Spirit, yet the
   official communication was established only at the time of His Baptism.
   Yet with this difference, that while in others the person and his
   office are separated at death, in the Messiah the two remain united
   even in and after death, to continue so until the moment that He shall
   deliver the Kingdom unto God the Father, that God may be all in all.
   Hence the descriptive remark of John: "I saw the Spirit descending from
   heaven, and it abode on Him" (John i. 32).

   And finally, to the question why the Person of the Mediator needed this
   remarkable event and the three signs that accompany it, we answer:

   First, Christ must be a true man even in His office, wherefore He must
   be installed according to the human custom. He enters upon His public
   ministry at thirty; He is publicly installed; and He is anointed with
   the Holy Spirit.

   Second, for His human consciousness this striking revelation from
   heaven was of the utmost necessity. The conflict of the temptation was
   to be absolute, i.e., indescribable; hence the impression of His
   consecration must be indestructible.

   Third, for the apostles and the Church it was necessary to distinguish
   unmistakably the true Messiah from all the pseudo-messiahs and
   antichrists. This is the reason of St. John's strong appeal to this
   event.

   If the work of the Holy Spirit with reference to the consecration is
   conspicuous and clearly indicated, the fact that the official influence
   of the Holy Spirit accompanied the Mediator throughout the entire
   administration of His office is not less clearly set forth in the Holy
   Scripture. This appears from the events immediately following the
   Baptism. St. Luke relates that Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit, was
   led by the Spirit into the wilderness. St. Matthew adds: "To be tempted
   of the devil." Of Elias, Ezekiel, and others it is said that the Spirit
   took them up and transferred them to some other place. This stands in
   evident connection with what we read here concerning Jesus. With this
   difference, however, that while the propelling power came to them from
   without, Jesus, being full of the Holy Spirit, felt its pressure in the
   very depths of His soul. And yet, altho operating in His soul, this
   action of the Holy Spirit was not identical with the impulses of
   Christ's human nature. Of Himself Jesus would not have gone into the
   desert; His going there was the result of the Holy Spirit's leading.
   Only in this way this passage receives its full explanation.

   That this leading of the Holy Spirit was not limited to this one act
   appears from St. Luke, who relates (chap. iv. 14) that after the
   temptation He returned in the power of the Holy Spirit into Galilee,
   thus entering upon the public ministry of His prophetic office.

   It is evidently the purpose of the Scripture to emphasize the fact of
   the inability of the human nature which Christ had adopted to
   accomplish the work of the Messiah without the constant operation and
   powerful leading of the Holy Spirit, whereby it was so strengthened
   that it could be the instrument of the Son of God for the performance
   of His wonderful work.

   Jesus was conscious of this, and at the beginning of His ministry
   expressly indicated it. In their synagogue He turned to Isa. lxi. 1,
   and read to them: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord
   hath anointed me"; then added: "This day is this Scripture fulfilled in
   your ears."

   The Holy Spirit did not support His human nature in the temptation and
   in the opening ministry only, but in all His mighty deeds, as Christ
   Himself testified: "If I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
   Kingdom of God is come unto you" (Matt. xii. 28). Moreover, St. Paul
   teaches that the gifts of healing and miracles proceed from the Holy
   Spirit, and this, in connection with the statement that these powers
   worked in Jesus (Mark vi. 14), convinces us that these were the very
   powers of the Holy Spirit. Again, it is frequently said He rejoiced in
   the Spirit or was troubled in the Spirit, which may be interpreted as a
   rejoicing or being troubled in His own spirit; but this is not a
   complete explanation. When it refers to His own spirit it reads: "And
   He sighed deeply in His spirit" (Mark viii. 12). But in the other cases
   we interpret the expressions as pointing to those deeper and more
   glorious emotions of which our human nature is susceptible only when
   abiding in the Holy Spirit. For altho St. John states that Jesus
   groaned in Himself (chap. xi. 38), this is not contradictory,
   especially with reference to Jesus. If the Holy Spirit always abode in
   Him, the same emotion may be attributed both to Him and to the Holy
   Spirit.

   Apart, however, from these passages and their interpretations, we have
   said enough to prove that that part of Christ's work of mediation,
   beginning with His Baptism and closing in the upper chamber, was marked
   by the operation, influence, and support of the Holy Spirit.

   According to the divine counsel, human nature is adapted in creation to
   the inworking of the Holy Spirit, without which it can not unfold
   itself any more than the rosebud without the light and influence of the
   sun. As the ear can not hear without sound, and the eye can not see
   without light, so is our human nature incomplete without the light and
   indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, when the Son assumed human
   nature He took it just as it is, i.e., incapable of any holy action
   without the power of the Holy Spirit. Hence He was conceived by the
   Holy Spirit, that from the beginning His human nature should be richly
   endowed with powers. The Holy Spirit developed these powers; and He was
   consecrated to His office by the communication to His human nature of
   the Messianic gifts by which He still intercedes for us as our High
   Priest, and rules us as our King. And for this reason He was guided,
   impelled, animated, and supported by the Holy Spirit at every step of
   His Messianic ministry.

   There are three differences between this communication of the Holy
   Spirit to the human nature of Jesus and that in us:

   First, the Holy Spirit always meets with the resistance of evil in our
   hearts. Jesus's heart was without sin and unrighteousness. Hence in His
   human nature the Holy Spirit met no resistance.

   Secondly, the Holy Spirit's operation, influence, support, and guidance
   in our human nature is always individual, i.e., in part, imperfect; in
   the human nature of Jesus it was central, perfect, leaving no void.

   Thirdly, in our nature the Holy Spirit meets with an ego which in union
   with that nature opposes God; while the Person which He met in the
   human nature of Christ, partaking of the divine nature, was absolutely
   holy. For the Son having adopted the human nature in union with His
   Person, was cooperating with the Holy Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Holy Spirit in the Passion of Christ.

   "Who through the Eternal Spirit offered Himself."--Heb. ix. 14.

   Thirdly--Let us now trace the work of the Holy Spirit in the suffering,
   death, resurrection, and exaltation of Christ (see "First" and
   "Second," pp. 93 and 97).

   In the Epistle to the Hebrews the apostle asks: "If the blood of goats
   and calves and the ashes of the heifer sprinkling the unclean,
   sanctifieth to the purification of the flesh, how much more shall the
   blood of Christ purge your conscience from dead works?" adding the
   words: "Who through the Eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to
   God." The meaning of these words has been much disputed. Beza and
   Gomarus understood the Eternal Spirit to signify Christ's divine
   nature. Calvin and the majority of reformers made it to refer to the
   Holy Spirit. Expositors of the present day, especially those of
   rationalistic tendencies, understand by it merely the tension of
   Christ's human nature.

   With the majority of orthodox expositors we adopt the view of Calvin.
   The difference between Beza and Calvin is that already referred to. The
   question is, whether as regards His human nature Christ substituted the
   inworking of the Son for that of the Holy Spirit; or did He have the
   ordinary operation of the Holy Spirit?

   At the present time many have adopted the former view without clearly
   understanding the difference. They reason thus: "Are the two natures
   not united in the Person of Jesus? Why, then, should the Holy Spirit be
   added to qualify the human nature? Could the Son Himself not do this?"
   And so they reach the conclusion that since the Mediator is God, there
   could be no need of a work of the Holy Spirit in the human nature of
   Christ. And yet this view must be rejected, for--

   First, God has so created human nature that without the Holy Spirit it
   can not have any virtue or holiness. Adam's original, righteousness was
   the work and fruit of the Holy Spirit as truly as the new life in the
   regenerate is today. The shining-in of the Holy Spirit is as essential
   to holiness as the shining of light into the eye is essential to
   seeing.

   Second, the work of the Son according to the distinction of three
   divine Persons is other than the work of the Holy Spirit with reference
   to the human nature. The Holy Spirit could not become flesh; this the
   Son alone could do. The Father has not delivered all things to the Holy
   Spirit. The Holy Spirit works from the Son but the Son depends upon the
   Holy Spirit for the application of redemption to individuals. The Son
   adopts our nature, thus relating Himself with the whole race; but the
   Holy Spirit alone can so enter into individual souls as to glorify the
   Son in the children of God.

   Applying these two principles to the Person of Christ, we see that His
   human nature could not dispense with the constant inshining of the Holy
   Spirit. For which reason Scripture declares: "He gave Him the Spirit
   without measure." Nor could the Son according to His own nature take
   the place of the Holy Spirit; but in the divine economy, by virtue of
   His union with the human nature ever depended upon the Holy Spirit.

   As to the question, whether the Godhead of Christ did not support His
   humanity, we answer: Undoubtedly; but never independently of the Holy
   Spirit. We faint because we resist, grieve, and repel the Holy Spirit.
   Christ was always victorious because His divinity never relaxed His
   hold upon the Holy Spirit in His humanity, but embraced Him and clave
   unto Him with all the love and energy of the Son of God.

   Human nature is limited. It is susceptible of receiving the Holy Spirit
   so as to be His temple. But that susceptibility has its limits. Opposed
   by eternal death, it loses its tension and falls away from the
   fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Hence we have no unlosable good in
   ourselves, but only as members of the body of Christ. Apart from Him,
   eternal death would have power over us, would separate us from the Holy
   Spirit and destroy us. Wherefore all our salvation lies in Christ. He
   is our anchor cast within the veil. As to the human nature of Christ,
   it encountered and passed through eternal death. This could not be
   otherwise. If He had passed only through temporal death, eternal death
   would still be unvanquished.

   To the question how His human nature could pass through eternal death
   and not perish, having no Mediator to support it, we answer: The human
   nature of Christ would have been overwhelmed by it, the in-shining of
   the Holy Spirit would have ceased if His divine nature, i.e., the
   infinite might of His Godhead, had not been underneath it. Hence the
   apostle declares: "Who through the Eternal Spirit offered Himself"; not
   through the Holy Spirit. The two expressions are not identical. There
   is a difference between the Holy Spirit, the third Person in the
   Godhead, apart from me, and the Holy Spirit working within me.

   The word of Scripture, "He was full of the Holy Ghost," refers not only
   to the Person of the Holy Spirit, but also to His work in man's soul.
   So with reference to Christ, there is a difference between: "He was
   conceived by the Holy Ghost," "The Holy Ghost descended upon Him,"
   "Being full of the Holy Spirit," "Who offered Himself by the Eternal
   Spirit." The last two passages indicate the fact that the spirit of
   Jesus had taken in the Holy Spirit and identified itself with Him, in
   almost the same sense as Acts xv. 28: "It seemed good to the Holy Ghost
   and to us." The term "Eternal Spirit" was chosen to indicate that the
   divine-human Person of Christ entered into such indissoluble fellowship
   with the Holy Spirit as even eternal death could not break.

   A closer examination of the sufferings of Christ will make this clear.

   Christ did not redeem us by His sufferings alone, being spit upon,
   scourged, crowned with thorns, crucified, and slain; but this passion
   was made effectual to our redemption by His love and voluntary
   obedience. These are generally called His passive and active
   satisfaction. By the first we understand His actual bearing of pain,
   anguish, and death; by the second, His zeal for the honor of God, the
   love, faithfulness, and divine pity by which He became obedient even
   unto death--yea, the death of the cross. And these two are essentially
   distinct. Satan, e.g., bears punishment also and shall bear it forever;
   but he lacks the willingness. This, however, does not affect the
   validity of the punishment. A murderer on the gallows may curse God and
   men to the end; but this does not invalidate his punishment. Whether he
   curses or prays, it is equally valid.

   Hence there was in Christ's sufferings much more than mere passive,
   penal satisfaction. Nobody compelled Jesus. He, partaker of the divine
   nature, could not be compelled, but offered Himself quite voluntarily:
   "Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God; in the volume of the book it is
   written of Me." To render that voluntary sacrifice He had with equal
   willingness adopted the prepared body: "Who being in the form of God
   thought it no robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no
   reputation; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and
   became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross"; "Who, tho He
   were a Son, yet learned He obedience." And to give highest proof of
   this obedience unto death, He inwardly consecrated Himself to death, as
   He Himself testified: "I sanctify Myself for them."

   This leads to the important question, whether Jesus rendered this
   obedience and consecration outside of His human nature, or in it, so
   that it manifested itself in His human nature. Undoubtedly the latter.
   The divine nature can not learn, or be tempted; the Son could not love
   the Father with other than eternal love. In the divine nature there is
   no more or less. To suppose this is to annihilate the divine nature.
   The statement that, "tho He were the Son, yet learned He obedience,"
   does not mean that as God He learned obedience; for God can not obey.
   God rules, governs, commands, but never obeys. As King He can serve us
   only in the form of a slave, hiding His princely majesty, having
   emptied Himself, standing before us as one despised among men. "Tho He
   were the Son" means, therefore: altho in His inward Being He is God the
   Son, yet He stood before us in such lowliness that nothing betrayed His
   divinity; yea, so lowly that He even learned obedience.

   Wherefore if the Mediator as man showed in His human nature such zeal
   for God and such pity for sinners that He willingly gave Himself in
   self-sacrifice unto death, then it is evident that His human nature
   could not exercise such consecration without the inworking of the Holy
   Spirit; and again that the Holy Spirit could not have effected such
   inworking unless the Son willed and desired it. The cry of the Messiah
   is heard in the words of the psalmist: "I delight to do Thy will, O
   God." The Son was willing so to empty Himself that it would be possible
   for His human nature to pass through eternal death; and to this end He
   let it be filled with all the mightiness of the Spirit of God. Thus the
   Son offered Himself "through the Eternal Spirit that we might serve the
   living God."

   Hence the work of the Holy Spirit in the work of redemption did not
   begin only at Pentecost, but the same Holy Spirit who in creation
   animates all life, upholds and qualifies our human nature, and in
   Israel and the prophets wrought the work of revelation, also prepared
   the body of Christ, adorned His human nature with gracious gifts, put
   these gifts into operation, installed Him into His office, led Him into
   temptation, qualified Him to cast out devils, and finally enabled Him
   to finish that eternal work of satisfaction whereby our souls are
   redeemed.

   This explains why Beza and Gomarus could not be fully satisfied with
   Calvin's exposition. Calvin said that it was the working of the Holy
   Spirit apart from the divinity of the Son. And they felt that there was
   something lacking. For the Son made Himself of no reputation and became
   obedient; but if all this is the work of the Holy Spirit, then nothing
   is left of the work of the Son. And to escape from this, they adopted
   the other extreme, and declared that the Eternal Spirit had reference
   only to the Son according to His divine nature--an exposition that can
   not be accepted, for the divine nature is never designated as spirit.

   Yet they were not altogether wrong. The reconciliation of these
   contrary views must be looked for in the difference between the
   existence of the Holy Spirit without us, and His working within us as
   received by our nature and identified with its own working. And
   inasmuch as the Son, by His Godhead, enabled His human nature, in the
   awful conflict with eternal death, to effect this union; therefore the
   apostle confesses that the sacrifice of the Mediator was rendered by
   the working of the Eternal Spirit.

  The Holy Spirit in the Glorified Christ.

   "Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of
   holiness, by the resurrection from the dead."--Rom. i. 4.

   From the foregoing studies it appears that the Holy Spirit performed a
   work in the human nature of Christ as He descended the several steps of
   His humiliation to the death of the cross.

   The question now arises, whether He had also a work in the several
   steps of Christ's exaltation to the excellent glory, i.e., in His
   resurrection, ascension, royal dignity, and second coming.

   Before we answer this question let us first consider the nature of this
   work in the exaltation. For it is evident that it must greatly differ
   from that in His humiliation. In the latter His human nature suffered
   violence. His sufferings antagonized not only His divine nature, but
   also His human nature. To suffer pain, insult, and mockery, to be
   scourged and crucified, goes against human nature. The effort to resist
   such sufferings and to escape from them is perfectly natural. Christ's
   groaning in Gethsemane is the natural utterance of the human feeling.
   He was burdened with the curse and wrath of God against the sin of the
   race. Then human nature struggled against the burden, and the cry,
   "Father, let this cup pass from Me," was the sincere and natural cry of
   horror which human nature could not repress.

   And not in Gethsemane alone; through His whole humiliation He
   experienced the same, tho in less degree. His self-emptying was not a
   single loss or bereavement, but a growing poorer and poorer, until at
   last nothing was left Him but a piece of ground where He could weep and
   a cross whereon He could die. He renounced all that heart and flesh
   hold dear, until, without friend or brother, without one tone of love,
   amid the mocking laughter of His slanderers, He gave up the ghost.
   Surely He trod the winepress alone.

   His humiliation being so deep and real, it is not surprising that the
   Holy Spirit succored and comforted His human nature so that it was not
   overwhelmed. For it is the proper work of the Holy Spirit by gifts of
   grace to enable human nature, tempted by sorrow to sin, to stand firm
   and overcome. He animated Adam before the fall; He comforts and
   supports all the children of God today; and He did the same in the
   human nature of Jesus. What air is to man's physical nature, the Holy
   Spirit is to his spiritual nature. Without air there is death in our
   bodies; without the Holy Spirit there is death in our souls. And as
   Jesus had to die, tho He was the Son, when breath failed Him, so He
   could not live according to His human nature, tho He was the Son,
   except the Holy Spirit dwelt in that nature. Since, according to the
   spiritual side of His human nature, He was not dead as we are, but was
   born possessed of the life of God, so it was impossible for His human
   nature for a single moment to be without the Holy Spirit.

   But how different in the state of His exaltation! Honor and glory are
   not against human nature, but satisfy it. It covets them and longs for
   them with all its energy of desire. Hence this exaltation created no
   conflict in the soul of Jesus. His human nature needed no support to
   bear it. Hence the question: What, then, could the Holy Spirit do for
   the human nature in the state of glory?

   Regarding the resurrection, the Scripture teaches more than once that
   it was connected with a work of the Holy Spirit. St. Paul says (Rom. i.
   4) that Jesus was "declared to be the Son of God, by the Spirit of
   holiness with power; by the resurrection from the dead." And St. Peter
   says (1 Peter iii. 18) that Christ "being put to death in the flesh,
   was quickened by the Spirit," which evidently refers to the
   resurrection, as the context shows: "For Christ once suffered for our
   sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." His
   death points to the crucifixion, and His quickening, being the opposite
   of the latter, undoubtedly refers to His resurrection.

   In Rom. viii. 11, speaking of our resurrection, St. Paul explains these
   more or less puzzling utterances, affirming that "if the Spirit of Him
   that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up
   Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His
   Spirit that dwelleth in you." This passage tells three things
   concerning our resurrection:

   First, that the Triune God shall raise us up.

   Second, that this shall be wrought by a special work of the Holy
   Spirit.

   Third, that it shall be effected by the Spirit that dwelleth in us.

   St. Paul induces us to apply these three to Christ; for He compares our
   resurrection with His, not only as regards the fact, but also as
   regards the working whereby it was effected. Hence with reference to
   the latter it must be confessed:

   First, that the Triune God raised Him from the dead, St. Peter stated
   this clearly on the day of Pentecost: "Whom God has raised up, having
   loosed the pains of death"; St. Paul repeated it in Ephes. i. 20, where
   he speaks of "His mighty power" which He wrought in Christ, when He
   raised Him from the dead.

   Second, that God the Holy Spirit performed a peculiar work in the
   resurrection.

   Third, that He wrought this work in Christ from within, dwelling in
   Him: "Which dwelleth in you."

   The nature of this work is apparent from the Holy Spirit's part in
   Adam's creation and in our birth. If the Spirit kindles and brings
   forth all life, especially in man, then it was He who rekindled the
   spark quenched by sin and death. He did so in Jesus; He will do so in
   us.

   The only remaining difficulty is on the third point: "Which dwelleth in
   you." The work of the Holy Spirit in our creation, and therefore in
   that of Christ's human nature, came from without; in the resurrection
   it works from within. Of course persons dying without being temples of
   the Holy Spirit are excluded. St. Paul speaks exclusively of men whose
   hearts are His temples. Hence, representing Him as dwelling in them, he
   speaks of Him as the Spirit of holiness, and Peter as the "Spirit,"
   indicating that they do not refer to a work of the Holy Spirit in
   opposition to the spirit of Jesus, but in which His spirit agreed and
   cooperated. And this harmonizes with Christ's own words, that in the
   resurrection He would not be passive, but active: "I have power to lay
   down life and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have
   received of My Father." The apostles declare again and again not only
   that Jesus was raised from the dead, but that He has risen. He had thus
   foretold it, and the angels said: "Behold, He is risen."

   Hence we reach this conclusion, that the work of the Holy Spirit in the
   resurrection was different from that in the humiliation; was similar to
   that in the creation; and was performed from within by the Spirit who
   dwelt in Him without measure, who continued with Him through His death,
   and in whose work His own spirit fully concurred.

   The work of the Holy Spirit in the exaltation of Christ is not so
   easily defined. The Scripture never speaks of it in connection with His
   ascension, His sitting at the right hand of the Father, nor with the
   Lord's second coming. Its connection with the descent at Pentecost will
   be treated in its proper place. Light upon these points can be obtained
   only from the scattered statements concerning the work of the Holy
   Spirit upon human nature in general. According to Scripture, the Holy
   Spirit belongs to our nature as the light to the eye; not only in its
   sinful condition, but also in the sinless state. From this we infer
   that Adam, before he fell was not without His inworking; hence that in
   the heavenly Jerusalem our human nature will possess Him in richer,
   fuller, more glorious measure. For our sanctified nature is a
   habitation of God through the Spirit--Ephes. ii. 22.

   If, therefore, our blessedness in heaven consists in the enjoyment of
   the pleasures of God, and it is the Holy Spirit who comes into contact
   with our innermost being, it follows that in heaven He can not leave
   us. And upon this ground we confess, that not only the elect, but the
   glorified Christ also, who continues to be a true man in heaven, must
   therefore forever continue to be filled with the Holy Spirit. This our
   churches have always confessed in the Liturgy: "The same Spirit which
   dwelleth in Christ as the Head and in us as His members."

   The same Holy Spirit who performed His work in the conception of our
   Lord, who attended the unfolding of His human nature, who brought into
   activity every gift and power in Him, who consecrated Him to His office
   as the Messiah, who qualified Him for every conflict and temptation,
   who enabled Him to cast out devils, and who supported Him in His
   humiliation, passion, and bitter death, was the same Spirit who
   performed His work in His resurrection, so that Jesus was justified in
   the Spirit (1 Tim. iii. 16), and who dwells now in the glorified human
   nature of the Redeemer in the heavenly Jerusalem.

   In this connection it should be noticed that Jesus said of His body:
   "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Temple
   was God's habitation on Zion; hence it was a symbol of that habitation
   of God that was to be set up in our hearts. Hence this saying refers
   not to the indwelling of the Son in our flesh, but to that of the Holy
   Spirit in the human nature of Jesus. Wherefore St. Paul writes to the
   Corinthians: "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
   Ghost, which is in you?" If the apostle calls our bodies temples of the
   Holy Ghost, why should we take it in another sense with reference to
   Jesus?

   If Christ dwelt in our flesh, i.e., in our human nature, body and soul,
   and if the Holy Ghost dwells, on the contrary, in the temple of our
   body, we see that Jesus Himself considered His death and resurrection
   an awful process of suffering through which He must enter into glory,
   but without being for a single moment separated from the Holy Spirit.

  The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

   "The Holy Spirit was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet
   glorified."--John vii. 39.

   We have come to the most difficult part in the discussion of the work
   of the Holy Spirit, viz., the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the
   tenth day after the ascension.

   In the treatment of this subject it is not our aim to create a new
   interest in the celebration of Pentecost. We consider this almost
   impossible. Man's nature is too unspiritual for this. But we shall
   reverently endeavor to give a clearer insight into this event to those
   in whose hearts the Holy Spirit has already begun His work.

   For, however simple the account of the second chapter of the Acts may
   seem, it is very intricate and hard to explain; and he who earnestly
   tries to understand and explain the event will meet more and more
   serious difficulties as he penetrates more deeply into the inward
   connection of the Holy Scripture. For this reason we claim not that our
   exposition will entirely solve this mystery. We shall endeavor only to
   fix the sanctified mind of the people of God more earnestly upon it,
   and convince them that on the whole this subject is treated too
   superficially.

   Four difficulties meet us in the examination of this event:

   First, How shall we explain the fact that while the Holy Spirit was
   poured out only on Pentecost, the saints of the Old Covenant were
   already partakers of His gifts?

   Second, How shall we distinguish the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
   nineteen centuries ago from His entering into the soul of the
   unconverted to-day?

   Third, How could the apostles--having already confessed the good
   confession, forsaking all, following Jesus, and upon whom He had
   breathed, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost " --receive the Holy
   Spirit only on the tenth day after the ascension?

   Fourth, How are we to explain the mysterious signs that accompany the
   outpouring? There are no angels praising God, but a sound is heard like
   that of a rushing, mighty wind; the glory of the Lord does not appear,
   but tongues of fire hover over their heads; there is no theophany, but
   a speaking in peculiar and uncommon sounds, understood, however, by
   those present.

   With reference to the first difficulty: How to explain the fact that,
   while the Holy Spirit was poured out only on Pentecost, the saints of
   the Old Covenant were already partakers of His gifts. Let us put this
   in the concrete: How are the following passages to be reconciled? "I am
   with you, saith the Lord of Hosts, and My Spirit remaineth among you,
   fear ye not" (Hag. ii. 4, 5); and "This spake He of the Holy Spirit
   which they that believe should receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet
   given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified" (John vii. 39).

   Scripture evidently seeks to impress us with the two facts, that the
   Holy Spirit came only on the day of Pentecost, and that the same Spirit
   had wrought already for centuries in the Church of the Old Covenant.
   Not only does St. John declare definitely that the Holy Spirit was not
   yet given, but the predictions of the prophets and of Jesus and the
   whole attitude of the apostles show that this fact may not in the least
   be weakened.

   Let us first examine the prophecies. Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Joel bear
   undeniable witness to the fact that this was the expectation of the
   prophets.

   Isaiah says: "The palaces shall be forsaken, the multitudes of the city
   shall be left--until the Spirit shall be poured upon us from on high;
   then the wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field
   shall be counted for a forest; then judgment shall dwell in the
   wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field." This
   prophecy evidently refers to an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that
   shall effect a work of salvation on a large scale, for it closes with
   the promise: "And the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the
   effect of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever" (Isa. xxxii.
   14-17).

   In like manner did Ezekiel prophesy "Then will I sprinkle clean water
   upon you, and ye shall be clean; a new heart also will I give you, and
   a new spirit will I put within you; and I will put My Spirit within
   you, and cause you to walk in My statutes; and ye shall keep My
   judgments, and do them; and I will save you from all your uncleanness.
   Not for yourselves will I do this, saith the Lord, be it known unto
   you" (chap. xxxvi. 25). Ezek. xi. 19 gives the prelude of this
   prophecy: "Thus saith the Lord God, I will give them one heart, and I
   will give a new Spirit within them; and I will take the stony heart out
   of their flesh, that they may walk in My statutes."

   Joel uttered his well-known prophecy: "And it shall come to pass
   afterward that I will pour My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and
   your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your
   young men shall see visions; and also upon thy servants and upon thy
   handmaidens in those days will I pour out My Spirit" (Joel ii. 30,
   31);--a prophecy which, according to the authoritative exposition of
   St. Peter, refers directly to the day of Pentecost.

   Zechariah adds a beautiful prophecy (xii. 10): "I will pour out the
   Spirit of grace and of supplication."

   It is true that these prophecies were given to Israel during its later
   period, when the vigorous spiritual life of the nation had already
   departed. But Moses expressed the same thought in his prophetic prayer:
   "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord
   would put His Spirit upon them" (Num. xi. 29). But these prophecies are
   evidence of the Old Testament prophetic conviction that the
   dispensation of the Holy Spirit in those days was exceedingly
   imperfect; that the real dispensation of the Holy Spirit was still
   tarrying; and that only in the days of the Messiah was it to come in
   all its fulness and glory.

   Regarding the second difficulty, our Lord repeatedly put the stamp of
   His divine authority upon this prophetic conviction, announcing to His
   disciples the still future coming of the Holy Spirit: "I will pray the
   Father and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with
   you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world can not receive,
   because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him, for He dwelleth with you
   and shall be in you" (John xiv. 16, 17); "When the Comforter is come
   whom I will send from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which
   proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me" (John xv. 26);
   "Behold, I send the promise of the Father upon you, and ye shall be
   endued with power from on high" (Luke xxiv. 49); "It is expedient for
   you that I go away; for if I go not away the Comforter will not come
   unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you. And when He is
   come; He will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of
   judgment" (John xvi. 7, 8). And lastly: He commanded them not to depart
   from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, "which,
   saith He, ye have heard of Me; for John truly baptized with water, but
   ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. And ye
   shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you" (Acts
   i. 4, 5, 8).

   The third difficulty is met by the fact that the communications of the
   apostles agree with the teaching of Scripture. They actually tarried in
   Jerusalem, without even attempting to preach during the days between
   the ascension and Pentecost. And they explain the Pentecost miracle as
   the fulfilment of the prophecies of Joel and Jesus. They see in it
   something new and extraordinary; and show us clearly that in their day
   it was considered that a man who stood outside the Pentecost miracle
   knew nothing of the Holy Ghost. For the disciples of Ephesus being
   asked, "Have ye received the Holy Ghost?" answered naively: "We have
   not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."

   Wherefore it cannot be doubted that the Holy Scripture means to teach
   and convince us that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost was
   His first and real coming into the Church.

   But how can this be reconciled with Old Testament passages such as
   these? "Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong,
   O Joshua, the High Priest; . . . for I am with you, . . . and My Spirit
   remaineth among you: fear ye not" (Hag. ii. 4, 5); and again: "Then He
   remembered the days of old, Moses, and His people, saying, Where is He
   that brought them up out of the sea with the Shepherd of His flock?
   where is He that put His Holy Spirit within them?" (Isa. lxiii. 11).
   David is conscious that he had received the Holy Spirit, for after his
   fall he prays: "Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me" (Psalm li. 13). There
   was a sending forth of the Spirit, for we read: "Thou sendest forth Thy
   Spirit, and they are created; and Thou renewest the face of the earth"
   (Psalm civ. 30). There seems to have been an actual descending of the
   Holy Spirit, for Ezekiel says: "The Spirit of the Lord fell upon me"
   (chap. xi. 5). Micah testified: "Truly I am full of the power by the
   Spirit of the Lord" (chap. iii. 8). Of John the Baptist it is written,
   that he should be filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's
   womb--Luke i. 15. Even the Lord Himself was filled with the Holy
   Spirit, whom He received without measure. That Spirit came upon Him at
   Jordan, how then could He be spoken of as still to come?--a question
   all the more puzzling since we read that in the evening of the
   resurrection Jesus breathed upon His disciples, saying "Receive ye the
   Holy Ghost" (John xx. 22).

   It has been necessary to present this large series of testimonies to
   show our readers the difficulty of the problem which we will endeavor
   to solve in the next article.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXV.

  The Holy Spirit in the New Testament Other than in the Old.

   "By His Spirit which dwelleth in you."--Rom. viii. 11.

   In order to understand the change inaugurated on Pentecost we must
   distinguish between the various ways in which the Holy Ghost enters
   into relationship with the creature.

   With the Christian Church we confess that the Holy Spirit is true and
   eternal God, and therefore omnipresent; hence no creature, stone or
   animal, man or angel, is excluded from His presence.

   With reference to His omniscience and omnipresence, David sings:
   "Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy
   presence? If I ascend up to heaven, Thou art there; if I make my bed in
   hell, behold, Thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning and
   dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Thy hand lead
   me and Thy right hand shall hold me." These words state positively that
   omnipresence belongs to the Holy Spirit; that neither in heaven nor in
   hell, in the east nor in the west, is there a spot or point from which
   He is excluded.

   This simple consideration is, for the matter under discussion, of the
   greatest importance; for it follows that the Holy Spirit can not be
   said ever to have moved from one place to another; to have been among
   Israel, but not among the nations; to have been present after the day
   of Pentecost where He was not before. All such representations directly
   oppose the confession of His omnipresence, eternity, and immutability.
   The Omnipresent One can not go from one place to another, for He can
   not come where He is already. And to suppose that He is omnipresent at
   one time and not at another is inconsistent with His eternal Godhead.
   The testimony of John the Baptist, "I saw the Spirit descending from
   heaven like a dove, and it abode on Him," and that of St. Luke, "The
   Holy Spirit fell on all them which heard the Word," may not therefore
   be understood as tho the Holy Spirit came to a place where He was not
   before, which is impossible.

   However--and this is the first distinction which will throw light upon
   the matter--David's description of omnipresence applies to local
   presence in space, but not to the world of spirits.

   We know not what spirits are, nor what our own spirit is. In the body
   we can distinguish between nerves and blood, bones and muscles, and we
   know something of their functions in the organism; but how a spirit
   exists, moves, and works, we can not tell. We only know that it exists,
   moves, and works in an entirely different way from that of the body.
   When a brother dies nobody opens a door or window for the exit of the
   soul; for we know that neither wall nor ceiling can hinder it in its
   heavenward flight. In prayer we whisper so as not to be overheard; yet
   we believe that the man Jesus Christ hears every word. The swiftness of
   a thought exceeds that of electricity. In a word, the limitations of
   the material world seem to disappear in the realm of spirits.

   Even the working of spirit on matter is wonderful. The average weight
   of an adult is about one hundred and sixty pounds. It takes three or
   four men to carry a dead body of that weight to the top of a high
   building; yet when the man was alive his spirit had the power to carry
   this weight up and down those flights of stairs easily and quickly. But
   where the spirit takes hold of the body, how it moves it, and where it
   obtains that swiftness, is for us a perfect mystery. Yet this shows
   that spirit is subject to laws wholly different from those that govern
   matter.

   We emphasize the word law. According to the analogy of faith, there
   must be laws that govern the spiritual world as there are in the
   natural; yet owing to our limitations we can not know them. But in
   heaven we shall know them, and all the glories and particulars of the
   spiritual world, as our physicians know the nerves and tissues of the
   body.

   This we know, however, that that which applies to matter does not
   therefore apply to spirit. God's omnipresence has reference to all
   space, but not to every spirit. Since God is omnipresent, it does not
   follow that He also dwells in the spirit of Satan. Hence, it is clear
   that the Holy Spirit can be omnipresent without dwelling in every human
   soul; and that He can descend without changing place, and yet enter a
   soul hitherto unoccupied by Him; and that He was present among Israel
   and among the Gentiles, and yet manifested Himself among the former and
   not among the latter. From this it follows that in the spiritual world
   He can come where He was not; that He came among Israel, not having
   been among them before; and that then He manifested Himself among them
   less powerfully and in another way than on and before the day of
   Pentecost.

   The Holy Spirit seems to act upon a human being in a twofold
   manner--from without, or from within. The difference is similar to that
   in the treatment of the human body by the physician and the surgeon:
   the former acts upon it by medicines taken inwardly; the latter by
   incisions and outward applications. A very defective comparison,
   indeed, but it may illustrate faintly the twofold operation of the Holy
   Spirit upon the souls of men.

   In the beginning we discover only an outward imparting of certain
   gifts. On Samson He bestows great physical strength. Aholiab and
   Bezaleel are endowed with artistic talent to build the tabernacle.
   Joshua is enriched with military genius. These operations did not touch
   the center of the soul, and were not saving, but merely external. They
   become more enduring when they assume an official character as in Saul;
   altho in him we find the best evidence of the fact that they are only
   outward and temporal. They assume a higher character when they receive
   the prophetic stamp; altho Balaam's example shows us that even thus
   they penetrate not to the center of the soul, but affect man only
   outwardly.

   But in the Old Testament there was also an inward operation in
   believers. Believing Israelites were saved. Hence they must have
   received saving grace. And since saving grace is out of the question
   without an inward working of the Holy Spirit, it follows that He was
   the Worker of faith in Abraham as well as in ourselves.

   The difference between the two operations is apparent. A person
   outwardly wrought upon may become enriched with outward gifts, while
   spiritually he remains as poor as ever. Or, having received the inward
   gift of regeneration, he may be devoid of every talent that adorns man
   outwardly.

   Hence we have these three aspects:

   First, there is the omnipresence of the Holy Spirit in space, the same
   in heaven and in hell, among Israel and among the nations.

   Second, there is a spiritual operation of the Holy Spirit according to
   choice, which is not omnipresent; active in heaven, but not in hell;
   among Israel, but not among the nations.

   Third, this spiritual operation works either from without, imparting
   losable gifts, or from within, imparting the unlosable gift of
   salvation.

   We have spoken so far of the work of the Holy Spirit upon individual
   persons, which was sufficient to explain that work in the days of the
   Old Testament. But when we come to the day of Pentecost, this no longer
   suffices. For His particular operation, on and after that day, consists
   in the extending of His operation to a company of men organically
   united.

   God did not create humanity as a string of isolated souls, but as a
   race. Hence in Adam the souls of all men are fallen and defiled. In
   like manner the new creation in the realm of grace has not wrought the
   generation of isolated individuals, but the resurrection of a new race,
   a peculiar people, a holy priesthood. And this favored race, this
   peculiar people, this holy priesthood is also organically one and
   partaking of the same spiritual blessing.

   The Word of God expresses this by teaching that the elect constitute
   one body, of which all are members, one being a foot, another an eye,
   and another an ear, etc.--a representation that conveys the idea that
   the elect mutually sustain the relation of a vital, organic, and
   spiritual union. And this is not merely outwardly, by mutual love, but
   much more through a vital communion which is theirs by virtue of their
   spiritual origin. As our Liturgy beautifully expresses it: "For as out
   of many grains one meal is ground and one bread baked, and out of many
   berries, being pressed together, one wine floweth and mixeth itself
   together, so shall we all, who by a true faith are ingrafted into
   Christ, be altogether one body."

   This spiritual union of the elect did not exist among Israel, nor could
   it exist during their time. There was a union of love, but not a
   spiritual and vital fellowship that sprang from the root of life. This
   spiritual union of the elect was made possible only by the incarnation
   of the Son of God. The elect are men consisting of body and soul;
   therefore it is partly at least a visible body. And only when in Christ
   the perfect man was given, who could be the temple of the Holy Spirit
   body and soul, did the inflowing and outpouring of the Holy Spirit
   become established in and through the body thus created.

   However, this did not occur directly after the birth of Christ, but
   after His ascension; for His human nature did not unfold its fullest
   perfection until after He had ascended, when, as the glorified Son of
   God, He sat down at the right hand of the Father. Only then the perfect
   Man was given, who on the one hand could be the temple of the Holy
   Ghost without hindrance, and on the other unite the spirits of the
   elect into one body. And when, by His ascension and sitting down at the
   right hand of God, this had become a fact, when thus the elect had
   become one body, it was perfectly natural that from the Head the
   indwelling of the Holy Spirit was imparted to the whole body. And thus
   the Holy Spirit was poured out into the body of the Lord, His elect,
   the Church.

   In this way everything becomes plain and clear: clear why the saints of
   the Old Testament did not receive the promise, that without us they
   should not be made perfect, waiting for that perfection until the
   formation of the body of Christ, into which they also were to be
   incorporated; clear that the tarrying of the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit did not prevent saving grace from operating upon the individual
   souls of the saints of the Old Covenant; clear the word of John, that
   the Holy Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified;
   clear that the apostles were born again long before Pentecost and
   received official gifts on the evening of the day of the resurrection,
   altho the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the body thus formed did not
   take place until Pentecost. It becomes clear how Jesus could say, "If I
   go not away the Comforter will not come unto you," and again, "But if I
   go I will send Him unto you"; for the Holy Spirit was to flow into His
   body from Himself, who is the Head. It becomes clear also that He would
   not send Him from Himself, but from the Father; clear why this
   outpouring of the Spirit into the body of Christ is never repeated, and
   could occur but once; and lastly, clear that the Holy Spirit was indeed
   standing in the midst of Israel (Isa. lxiii. 12), working upon the
   saints from without, while in the New Testament He is said to be within
   them.

   We arrive, therefore, at the following conclusions:

   First, the elect must constitute one body.

   Second, they were not so constituted during the days of the Old
   Covenant, of John the Baptist, and of Christ while on earth.

   Third, this body did not exist until Christ ascended to heaven and,
   sitting at the right hand of God, bestowed upon this body its unity, in
   that God gave Him to be Head over all things to the Church--Ephes. iv.
   12.

   Lastly, Christ as the glorified Head, having formed His spiritual body
   by the vital union of the elect, on the day of Pentecost poured out His
   Holy Spirit into the whole body, never more to let Him depart from it.

   That these conclusions contain nothing but what the Church of all ages
   has confessed appears from the fact that the Reformed churches have
   always maintained:

   First, that our communion with the Holy Spirit depends upon our mystic
   union with the body of which Christ is the Head, which is the
   underlying thought of the Lord's Supper.

   Second, that the elect form one body under Christ their Head.

   Third, that this body began to exist when it received its Head; and
   that, according to Ephes. i. 22. Christ was given to be the Head after
   His resurrection and ascension.

  Israel and the Nations.

   "Because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy
   Ghost."--Acts x. 45.

   The question that arises with reference to Pentecost is: Since the Holy
   Spirit imparted saving grace to men before and after Pentecost, what is
   the difference caused by that descent of the Holy Spirit?

   An illustration may explain the difference. The rain descends from
   heaven and man gathers it to quench his thirst. When householders
   collect it each in his own cistern, it comes down for every family
   separately; but when, as in modern city life, every house is supplied
   from the city reservoir, by means of mains and water-pipes, there is no
   more need of pumps and private cisterns. Suppose that a city whose
   citizens for ages have been drinking each from his own cistern proposes
   to construct a reservoir that will supply every home. When the work is
   completed the water is allowed to run through the system of mains and
   pipes into every house. It might then be said that on that day the
   water was poured out into the city. Hitherto it fell upon every man's
   roof: now it streams through the organized system into every man's
   house.

   Apply this to the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, and the difference
   before and after Pentecost will be apparent. The mild showers of the
   Holy Spirit descended upon Israel of old in drops of saving grace; but
   in such a manner only that each gathered of the heavenly rain for
   himself, to quench the thirst of each heart separately. So it continued
   until the coming of Christ. Then there came a change; for He gathered
   the full stream of the Holy Spirit for us all, in His own Person. With
   Him all saints are connected by the channels of faith. And when, after
   His ascension, this connection with His saints was completed, and He
   had received the Holy Spirit from His Father, then the last obstacle
   was removed and the full stream of the Holy Spirit came rushing through
   the connecting channels into the heart of every believer.

   Formerly isolation, every man for himself; now organic union of all the
   members under their one Head: this is the difference between the days
   before and after Pentecost. The essential fact of Pentecost consisted
   in this, that on that day the Holy Spirit entered for the first time
   into the organic body of the Church, and individuals came to drink, not
   each by himself, but all together in organic union.

   To the question where that system of connecting channels uniting us in
   one body under our Head may be found, we can give no answer. This
   belongs to things invisible and spiritual which escape our observation,
   of which we can have no other representation than that by an image.

   Yet this does not alter the fact that the organic union really exists.
   The Word of God is to us its undeniable witness. Organic life appears
   in nature in two forms: in the plant, and in the body of man and
   animal. These are the very types that Christ uses to illustrate the
   spiritual union between Himself and His people. He said: "I am the
   Vine, ye are the branches." And St. Paul speaks of having become one
   plant with Christ. And he frequently uses the image of the body and its
   members.

   Hence there can be no doubt that there exists a mystic union between
   Christ and believers which works by means of an organic connection,
   uniting the Head and the members in a for us invisible and
   incomprehensible manner. By means of this organic union the Holy Spirit
   was poured out on Pentecost from Christ the Head into us, the members
   of His body.

   If it were possible to construct the city's water-works in the air
   above the city, the chief engineer could properly say: "When I turn on
   the water for the first time I will baptize the city with water." In
   similar sense Christ may be said to have baptized His Church with the
   Holy Spirit. For the word of John the Baptist, "I indeed baptize you
   with water, but He that cometh after me is mightier than I; He shall
   baptize you with the Holy Ghost," is explained by Christ Himself as
   referring to the day of Pentecost (Acts i. 5): "And being assembled
   together with Him, He commanded them that they should not depart from
   Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith He, ye
   have heard of Me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be
   baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence";--a promise that
   undoubtedly referred to the Pentecost miracle. This agrees with the
   fact that Jesus during His ministry allowed His disciples to continue
   the Baptism of John. And this shows that even before the crucifixion,
   John and Peter, Philip and Zaccheus, and many others received saving
   grace of the Holy Spirit, each for himself, but none of them was
   baptized with the Holy Spirit before the day of Pentecost.

   With reference to the apostles, we must therefore distinguish a
   threefold giving of the Holy Spirit:

   First, that of saving grace in regeneration and subsequent
   illumination--Matt. xvi. 17.

   Secondly, official gifts qualifying them for the apostolic office--John
   xx. 22.

   Thirdly, the Baptism with the Holy Ghost--Acts i. 5 in connection with
   Acts ii. 1 ff.

   One more difficulty remains. We often read of outpourings of the Holy
   Spirit after Pentecost. How can this be reconciled with our
   explanation? In Acts x. 44, 45 we read: "While Peter yet spake these
   words, the Holy Ghost fell on all who heard the word. And they of the
   circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with
   Peter, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy
   Ghost." And Peter confirms this by saying: "Can any man forbid water
   that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost
   as well as we?" From this it is evident that the outpouring on the
   house of Cornelius was of the same nature as that on Pentecost.
   Moreover, we hear of a descent of the Holy Ghost in Samaria (Acts
   viii.), and of another in Ephesus (Acts xix. 6). This descent took
   place in both instances after the laying on of hands by the apostles;
   and at Caesarea and Corinth it was followed by a speaking with foreign
   tongues as in Jerusalem.

   It is evident, therefore, that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was
   not limited to Pentecost in Jerusalem, but was afterward repeated in a
   weaker and modified form, but still extraordinarily, as on Pentecost.

   And who would deny that there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit
   to-day in the churches? Without it there can be no regeneration, no
   salvation. Yet the Pentecost signs are lacking, e.g., there is no more
   speaking with tongues. Hence it is necessary to distinguish between the
   ordinary outpouring which occurs now, and the extraordinary at Corinth,
   Caesarea, Samaria, and Jerusalem.

   Hence the question stands as follows: If on the day of Pentecost the
   Holy Spirit was poured out once for all and forever, how do we account
   for the ordinary and extraordinary outpourings?

   Allow us once more to recur to our former illustration. Suppose that
   the city above referred to consisted of a lower and an upper part, both
   to be supplied from the same reservoir. Upon the completion of its
   system the lower city may receive the water first, and the upper part
   receive it only after the system shall have been extended. Here we
   notice two things: the distribution of the water took place but once,
   which was the formal opening of the waterworks, and could take place
   but once; while the distribution of the water in the upper city, altho
   extraordinary; was but an after-effect of the former event. This is a
   fair illustration of what took place in the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit. The Church consisted of parts sharply defined, viz. the Jewish,
   and the Gentile world. Yet both are to constitute one body, one people,
   one Church; both are to live one life in the Holy Ghost. On Pentecost
   He is poured out into the body, but only to quench the thirst of one
   part, i.e., the Jewish; the other part is still excluded. But now
   apostles and evangelists start from Jerusalem and come into contact
   with the Gentiles, and the hour has come for the stream of the Holy
   Ghost to pour forth into the Gentile part of the Church, and the whole
   body is refreshed by the same Holy Spirit. Hence there is an original
   outpouring in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, and a supplementary
   outpouring in Caesarea for the Gentile part of the Church; both of the
   same nature, but each bearing its own special character.

   Besides these there are some isolated outpourings of the Holy Spirit,
   attended by the laying on of the apostles' hands, as in the case of
   Simon Magus. We explain this as follows: as from time to time new
   connections are made between individual houses and the city reservoir,
   so new parts of the body of Christ were added to the Church from
   without, into whom the Holy Spirit was poured forth from the body as
   into new members. It is perfectly natural that in these cases the
   apostles appear as instruments; and that, receiving into the Church
   persons that come from a part of the world not yet connected with the
   Church, they extend to them by the laying on of hands the fellowship of
   the Holy Ghost who dwells in the body.

   This also explains why to-day newly converted persons receive the Holy
   Spirit only in the ordinary way. For they who are converted among us
   stand already in the covenant, belong already to the seed of the Church
   and to the body of Christ. [13] Hence no new connection is formed, but
   a work of the Holy Spirit is wrought in a soul with which He was
   already related by means of the body.

   And thus every objection is met and every detail is put in its own
   place, and the lines of the domain which had become vague and confused
   are once more clearly drawn.

   It is evident also that the prayer for another outpouring or baptism of
   the Holy Spirit is incorrect and empty of real meaning. Such prayer
   actually denies the Pentecost miracle. For He that came and abides with
   us can no more come to us.

  XXVII.

  The Signs of Pentecost.

   "Signs in the earth beneath." --Acts ii. 19.

   Let us now consider the signs that accompanied the outpouring of the
   Holy Spirit--the sound of a rushing, mighty wind; tongues of fire; and
   the speaking with other tongues--which constitute the fourth difficulty
   that meets us in the investigation of the events of Pentecost (see p.
   113). The first and second precede, the third follows the outpouring.

   These signs are not merely symbolic. The speaking with other tongues,
   at least, appears as part of the narrative. Symbols are intended to
   represent or indicate something or to call the attention to it; hence
   it may be omitted without affecting the matter itself. A symbol is like
   a finger-post on the road: it may be removed without affecting the
   road. If the Pentecost signs were purely symbolic, the event would have
   been the same without them; but the absence of the sign of other
   tongues would have modified the character of the subsequent history
   completely.

   This justifies the supposition that the two preceding signs were also
   constituent parts of the miracle. The fact that neither of them is an
   apt symbol strengthens the supposition; for a symbol must speak. The
   finger-post that leaves the traveler in doubt concerning the direction
   he is to take is no finger-post. Considering the fact that for eighteen
   centuries theologians have been unable to ascertain the significance of
   the so-called symbols with any degree of certainty, it must be
   acknowledged that it is difficult to believe that the apostles or the
   multitude understood their significance at once and in the same way.
   The issue proves the contrary. They did not understand the signs. The
   multitude, confounded and perplexed, said one to another: "What meaneth
   this?" And when Peter arose as an apostle, enlightened by the Holy
   Spirit, to interpret the miracle, he made no effort to attach any
   symbolic significance to the signs, but simply declared that an event
   had taken place by which the prophecy of Joel was fulfilled.

   Did the event of Pentecost then exhaust the prophecy of Joel? By no
   means; for the sun was not turned into darkness, nor the moon into
   blood; and we hear nothing of the dreams of old men. Nor could it; the
   notable day that will exhaust this and so many other prophecies can not
   come until the return of the Lord. But the holy apostle meant to say,
   that the day of the Lord's return was brought so much nearer by this
   event. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is one of the great events
   which pledge the coming of that great and notable day. Without it that
   day can not come. Looking back from heaven, the day of Pentecost will
   appear to us as the last great miracle immediately preceding the day of
   the Lord. And since that day shall be attended by awful signs, as was
   the preparatory day of Pentecost, the apostle puts them together and
   makes them appear as one, showing that in Joel's prophecy God points to
   both events.

   If it be certain that the signs attending the Lord's return--blood,
   fire, and vapor of smoke--shall not be symbolic, but constituent
   elements of that last part of the world's history, viz., its last
   conflagration, then it is certain that Peter did not understand the
   signs of Pentecost to be symbolic.

   Neither can the still more unsatisfactory explanation be entertained
   that these signs were intended to draw and fix the attention of the
   multitude.

   The senses of sight and hearing are the most effectual means by which
   the outside world can act upon our consciousness. In order suddenly to
   arouse and excite a person, one need only startle him by an explosion
   or by the flash of a dazzling light. Acting upon this, some of the
   earlier Methodists used to fire pistols at their revival meetings,
   hoping that the report and flash would create the desired state of
   mind. The subsequent excitement of the people would tend to make them
   more susceptible to the operation of the Holy Spirit. Similar
   experiments are those of the Salvation Army. According to this notion,
   the signs of Pentecost bore a similar character. It is supposed by some
   that the disciples, still unconverted men, were sitting together in the
   upper chamber on the day of Pentecost. To render them susceptible to
   the inflowing of the Holy Spirit they must be aroused by a noise and
   fire. It must seem as tho a violent thunder-storm had burst upon the
   city; flashes of lightning and peals of thunder were seen and heard.
   And when the multitude were startled and terrified, then the desired
   condition for receiving the Holy Spirit prevailed and the outpouring
   took place. Such extravagances only hurt the tender sense of the
   children of God; while it is almost sacrilege to compare the signs of
   Pentecost to the report of a pistol.

   Hence there remains only one other explanation, i.e., to consider the
   Pentecost signs as actual and real constituents of the event;
   indispensable links in the chain of occurrences.

   When a ship enters the harbor we see the foaming spray under the bow
   and hear the waters dashing against the sides. When, a horse runs
   through the street we hear the noise of his hoofs against the pavement
   and see the clouds of dust. But who will say that these things seen and
   heard are symbolic? They necessarily belong to those actions and are
   parts of them, impossible without them. Therefore we do not believe
   that the Pentecost signs were symbolic, or intended to create a
   sensation, but that they belonged inseparably to the outpouring of the
   Holy Ghost, and were caused by it. The outpouring could not take place
   without creating these signs. When the mountain-stream dashes down the
   steep sides of the rocks we must hear the sound of rushing waters, we
   must see the flying spray; so when the Holy Spirit flows down from the
   mountains of God's holiness, the sound of a rushing, mighty wind must
   be heard, and glorious brightness must be seen, and a speaking with
   foreign tongues must follow.

   This will sufficiently explain our meaning. Not that we deny that these
   signs had also a significance for the multitude. The noise of the
   horse's hoofs warns travelers on the road. And we concede that the
   purpose of the signs was realized in the perplexity and consternation
   which they caused in the hearts of those present. But this we maintain,
   that even in the absence of the multitude and their consternation the
   sound of a rushing, mighty wind would have been heard and the fiery
   tongues would have been seen. As the horse's hoofs cause the ground to
   vibrate tho there be no traveler in sight, so the Holy Spirit could not
   come down without that sound and that brightness, even tho not a single
   Jew were to be found in all Jerusalem.

   The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was real, not apparent. Having found
   His temple in the glorified Head, He must necessarily flow down into
   the body and descend from heaven. And this descent from heaven and this
   sowing into the body could not take place without causing these signs.

   To penetrate more deeply into this matter is not lawful. On Horeb
   Elijah heard the Lord pass by in a gentle breeze, Isaiah heard the
   moving of the door-posts in the Temple. This seems to indicate that the
   approach of the divine majesty causes a commotion in the elements
   perceptible to the auditory nerve. But how, we can not tell. We
   observe, however:

   First, that spirit can act upon matter is evident, for our spirits act
   upon the body every moment, and by that action are able to produce
   sounds. Speaking, crying, singing are nothing but our spirit acting
   upon the currents of air. And if our spirit is capable of such action,
   why not the Spirit of the Lord? Why, then, call it mysterious when the
   Holy Spirit in His descent so wrought upon the elements that the
   effects vibrated in the ears of those present?

   Secondly, in making the covenant with Israel upon Sinai, the Lord God
   spoke in peals of thunder so terrible that even Moses said, "I am
   exceedingly fearful and quaking"; yet not with the intention of
   terrifying the people, but because a holy and angry God can not speak
   otherwise to a sinful generation. It is not therefore surprising that
   the coming of God to His New Covenant people is attended by similar
   signs, not in order to draw men's attention, but because it could not
   be otherwise.

   The same applies to the tongues of fire. Supernatural manifestations
   are always attended by light and brightness, especially when the Lord
   Jehovah or His angel appears. Recall, e.g., God's covenant-making with
   Abraham, or the occurrences at the burning bush. Why, then, should it
   surprise us that the descent of the Holy Spirit was attended by
   phenomena such as those seen by Elijah on Horeb, Moses in the bush, St.
   Paul on the way to Damascus, and St. John on Patmos? That the cloven
   tongues sat upon each of them proves nothing to the contrary; for He
   proceeded to each of them and entered their hearts, and in each going
   He left a trace of light behind.

   The question, whether the fire seen by these men on those occasions
   belonged to a higher sphere, or was the effect of God's action upon the
   elements of the earth, can not be answered.

   Both views have much in their favor. There is no darkness in heaven;
   and the heavenly light must be of a higher nature than ours, even above
   the brightness of the sun, according to St. Paul's description of the
   light on the way to Damascus. It is very probable, therefore, that in
   these great events the boundary of heaven overlapped the earth, and a
   higher glory shone in upon our atmosphere.

   But, on the other hand, it is possible that the Holy Spirit wrought
   this mysterious brightness directly by a miracle. And this seems to be
   confirmed by the fact that the signs attending the law-giving on Sinai,
   which event was parallel to this, were not from higher spheres, but
   wrought from earthly elements.

   Finally, let it be noticed, that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on
   the house of Cornelius and on the disciples of Apollos was attended by
   a speaking with other tongues, but not by the other signs. This
   confirms our theory; for it was not a coming to the house of Cornelius,
   but a conducting of the Holy Spirit into another part of the body of
   Christ. If symbolism had been intended, the signs would have been
   repeated; not being symbols, they did not appear.

  XXVIII.

  The Miracle of Tongues.

   "If any man speak in an (unknown) tongue, . . . let one interpret. But
   if there be no interpreter, let him speak to himself, and to God."-- 1
   Cor. xiv. 27, 28.

   The third sign following the outpouring of the Holy Spirit consisted in
   extraordinary sounds that proceeded from the lips of the
   apostles--sounds foreign to the Aramaic tongue, never before heard from
   their lips.

   These sounds affected the multitude in different ways: some called them
   babblings of inebriated men; others heard in them the great works of
   God proclaimed. To the latter, it seemed as tho they heard them
   speaking in their own tongues. To the Parthian it sounded like the
   Parthian, to the Arabian like the Arabic, etc.; while St. Peter
   declared that this sign belonged to the realm of revelation, for it was
   the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel that all the people should
   become partakers of the operation of the Holy Spirit.

   The question how to interpret this wonderful sign has occupied the
   thinking minds of all times. Allow us to offer a solution, which we
   present in the following observations:

   In the first place--This phenomenon of spiritual speaking in
   extraordinary sounds is not confined to Pentecost nor to the second
   chapter of the Acts.

   On the contrary, the Lord told His disciples, even before the
   ascension, that they should speak with new tongues--Mark xvi. 8. And
   from the epistles of St. Paul it is evident that this prophecy did not
   refer to Pentecost alone; for we read in 1 Cor. xii. 10 that in the
   apostolic Church, spiritual gifts included that of tongues; that some
   spoke in gene glottou, i.e., in kinds of tongues or sounds. In ver. 28
   the apostle declares that God has set this spiritual phenomenon in the
   Church. It is noteworthy that in 1 Cor. xiv. 1-33 the apostle gives
   special attention to this extraordinary sign, showing that then it was
   quite ordinary. That the gift of tongues mentioned by St. Paul and the
   sign of which St. Luke speaks in Acts ii., are substantially one and
   the same can not be doubted. In the first place; Christ's prophecy is
   general: "They shall speak with new tongues." Secondly, both phenomena
   are said to have made irresistible impressions upon unbelievers.
   Thirdly, both are treated as spiritual gifts. And lastly, to both is
   applied the same name.

   Yet there was a very perceptible difference between the two: the
   miracle of tongues on the day of Pentecost was intelligible to a large
   number of hearers of different nationalities; while in the apostolic
   churches it was understood only by a few who were called interpreters.
   Connected with this is the fact that the miracle on Pentecost made the
   impression of speaking at once to different hearers in different
   tongues so that they were edified. However, this is no fundamental
   difference. Altho in the apostolic churches there were but few
   interpreters, yet there were some who understood the wonderful speech.

   There was, moreover, a marked difference between the men thus endowed:
   some understood what they were saying; others did not. For St. Paul
   admonishes them, saying: "Let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue,
   pray that he may interpret" (1 Cor. xiv. 13). Yet even without this
   ability, the speaking with tongues had an edifying effect upon the
   speaker himself; but it was an edification not understood, the effect
   of an unknown operation in the soul.

   From this we gather that the miracle of tongues consisted in the
   uttering of extraordinary sounds which from existing data could be
   explained neither by the speaker nor by the hearer; and to which
   another grace was sometimes added, viz., that of interpretation. Hence
   three things were possible: that the speaker alone understood what he
   said; or, that others understood it and not himself; or, that both
   speaker and hearers understood it. This understanding has reference to
   one or more persons.

   On the ground of this we comprise these miracles of tongues in one
   class; with this distinction, however, that on the day of Pentecost the
   miracle appeared perfect, but later on incomplete. As there is in the
   miracles of Christ in raising the dead a perceptible increase of power:
   first, the raising up of one just dead (the daughter of Jairus), then,
   of one about to be buried (the young man of Nam), and lastly, of one
   already decomposing (Lazarus); so there is also in the miracle of
   tongues a difference of power--not increasing, but decreasing. The
   mightiest operation of the Holy Spirit is seen first, then those less
   powerful. It is precisely the same as in our own heart: first, the
   mighty fact of regeneration; after that, the less marked manifestations
   of spiritual power. Hence on Pentecost there was the miracle of tongues
   in its perfection; later on in the churches, in weaker measure.

   Secondly--There is no evidence that the miracle of tongues consisted in
   the speaking of one of the known languages not previously acquired.

   If this had been the case, St. Paul could not have said: "If I pray in
   an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is
   unfruitful" (1 Cor. xiv. 14). The word "unknown" appears in italics,
   not being found in the Greek. Moreover, he says that tongues are for a
   sign not to them that believe, but to them that believe not--ver. 22.
   If it had been a question of foreign but ordinary languages, the matter
   of understanding them could not depend upon faith, but simply upon the
   fact whether the language was acquired by study or was one's native
   tongue.

   Finally, the notion that these tongues refer to foreign languages not
   acquired by study is contradicted by St. Paul: "I thank my God that I
   speak with tongues more than ye all." By which he can not mean that he
   had mastered more languages than others, but that he possessed the gift
   of tongues in greater degree than other men. The following verse is
   evidence: "Yet in the Church I had rather speak five words with my
   understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in
   an (unknown) tongue." According to the other view, this ought to have
   been: "I wish to speak in one language, so that the Church may
   understand me, rather than in ten or twenty languages which the Church
   understands not." But the apostle does not say this. He speaks not of
   many languages in opposition to one, but of five sounds or words
   against ten thousand words. From this it follows that St. Paul's "I
   speak with glottai (languages or sounds) more than ye all," must refer
   to the miracle of sounds.

   For altho it is objected very naturally that on Pentecost the apostles
   spoke the Arabic, Hebrew, and Parthian tongues besides many others, yet
   the fact appealed to is not proven to be a fact. Surely we learn from
   Acts ii. that these Parthians, Elamites, etc., received the impression
   that they were addressed each in his own tongue; yet the narrative
   itself proves rather the contrary. Let the experiment be tried. Let
   fifteen men (the number of languages mentioned in Acts ii.) speak in
   fifteen different languages at once and together, and the result will
   be not that every one hears his own language, but that no one can hear
   anything. But the narrative of Acts ii. is fully explained in that the
   apostles uttered sounds intelligible to Parthians, Medes, Cretans,
   etc., because they understood them, receiving the impression that these
   sounds agreed with their own mother-tongues. As a Dutch child seeing a
   problem on the blackboard worked out by an English or German child
   naturally receives the impression that it was done by a Dutch child,
   simply because figures are signs not affected by the difference of
   language, so must the Elamite have received the impression that he
   heard the Elamitian, and the Egyptian that he was addressed in the
   Egyptian tongue, when on Pentecost they heard sounds uttered by a
   miracle, which, being independent from the difference of language, were
   intelligible to man as man.

   We must not forget that speaking is nothing else than to produce
   impressions upon the soul of the hearer by means of vibrations in the
   air. But if the same impressions can be produced without the aid of
   air-vibrations, the effect upon the hearer must be the same. Try the
   experiment upon the eye. The sight of twinkling stars or dissolving
   figures excites the retina. The same effect can be produced by rubbing
   the eye with the finger when reclining on a couch in a dark room. And
   this applies here. The air vibrations are not the principal thing, but
   the emotion produced in the mind by the speaking. The Pamphylian,
   accustomed to receive emotions by hearing his mother-tongue, and
   receiving the same impression in another way, must think that he is
   addressed in the Pamphylian tongue.

   Thirdly--According to St. Paul's interesting information, the miracle
   of tongues consisted in this, that the vocal organs produced sounds not
   by a working of the mind, but by an operation of the Holy Spirit upon
   those organs.

   St. Luke writes: "They began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
   gave them utterance" (Acts ii. 4); and St. Paul proves exhaustively
   that the person speaking with tongues spoke not with his understanding,
   i.e., as a result of his own thinking, but in consequence of an
   entirely different operation. That this is possible, we see, first, in
   delirious persons, who say things outside of their own personal
   thinking; second, in the insane, whose incoherent talk has no sense;
   third, in persons possessed, whose vocal organs are used by demons;
   fourth, in Balaam, whose vocal organs uttered words of blessing upon
   Israel against his will.

   Hence it must be conceded that in man three things are possible:

   First, that for a time he maybe deprived of the use of his vocal
   organs.

   Second, that the use of these organs may be appropriated by a spirit
   who has overcome him.

   Third, that the Holy Spirit, appropriating his vocal organs, can
   produce sounds from his lips which are "new," and "other" than the
   language which ordinarily he speaks.

   Fourthly--In the Greek these sounds invariably are designated by the
   word Ã£Ã«Ã¹Ã´Ã´Ã¡Ã©, i.e., tongues, hence language. In the Greek world, from
   which this word is taken, the word "glotta" always stands in strong
   opposition to the "logos," reason.

   A man's thinking is the hidden, invisible, imperceptible process of his
   mind. Thought has a soul, but no body. But when the thought manifests
   itself and adopts a body, then there is a word. And the tongue being
   the movable organ of speech, it was said that the tongue gives a body
   to the thought. Hence the contrast between the logos, i.e., that which
   a man thinks with the mind, and the glotta, i.e., that which he utters
   with the vocal organs.

   Ordinarily the glotta comes only through and after the logos. But in
   the miracle of tongues we discover the extraordinary phenomenon that
   while the logos remained inactive, the glotta uttered sounds. And since
   it was a phenomenon of sounds which proceeded not from the thinking
   mind, but from the tongue, the Holy Scripture calls it very
   appropriately a gift of the glottai, i.e., a gift of tongue or
   sound-phenomena.

   Lastly--In answer to the question, How must this be understood? we
   offer the following representation: Speech in man is the result of his
   thinking; and this thinking in a sinless state is an in-shining of the
   Holy Spirit. Speech in a sinless state is therefore the result of
   inspiration, in-breathing of the Holy Spirit.

   Hence in a sinless state man's language would have been the pure and
   perfect product of an operation of the Holy Spirit. He is the Creator
   of human language; and without the injury and debasing influence of sin
   the connection between the Holy Ghost and our speech would have been
   complete. But sin has broken the connection. Human language is damaged:
   damaged by the weakening of the organs of speech; by the separation of
   tribes and nations; by the passions of the soul; by tie darkening of
   the understanding; and principally by the lie which has entered in.
   Hence that infinite distance between this pure and genuine human
   language which, as the direct operation of the Holy Spirit upon the
   human mind, should have manifested itself, and the empirically existing
   languages that now separate the nations--a difference like unto that
   between the glorious Adam and the deformed Hottentot.

   But the difference is not intended to remain. Sin will disappear. What
   sin destroyed will be restored. In the day of the Lord, at the
   wedding-feast of the Lamb, all the redeemed will understand one
   another. In what way? By the restoration of the pure and original
   language upon the lips of the redeemed, which is born from the
   operation of the Holy Spirit upon the human mind. And of that great,
   still-tarrying event the Pentecost miracle is the germ and the
   beginning; hence it bore its distinctive marks. In the midst of the
   Babeldom of the nations, on the day of Pentecost, the one pure and
   mighty human language was revealed which one day all will speak, and
   all the brethren and sisters from all nations and tongues will
   understand.

   And this was wrought by the Holy Spirit. They spake as the Holy Spirit
   gave them utterance. They spoke a heavenly language to praise God--not
   of angels, but a language above the influence of sin.

   Hence the understanding of this language was also a work of the Holy
   Spirit. At Jerusalem, only they understood it who were specially
   wrought upon by the Holy Spirit. The others understood it not. And at
   Corinth it was not comprehended by the masses, but by him alone to whom
   it was given of the Holy Ghost.

  The Apostolate.

   "That ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is
   with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ."--1 John i. 3.

   The apostolate bears the character of an extraordinary manifestation,
   not seen before or after it, in which we discover a proper work of the
   Holy Spirit. The apostles were ambassadors extraordinary -- different
   from the prophets, different from the present ministers of the Word. In
   the history of the Church and the world they occupy a unique position
   and have a peculiar significance. Hence the apostolate is entitled to a
   special discussion.

   Moreover, the apostolate belongs to the great things which the Holy
   Spirit has wrought. All that the Holy Scripture declares concerning the
   apostles compels us to look for an explanation of their persons and
   mission in a special work of the Holy Spirit. Before His ascension
   Jesus predicted repeatedly that they should be His witnesses only after
   they shall have received the Holy Spirit in an extraordinary manner.
   Until this promise is fulfilled they remain hiding in Jerusalem. And
   when they raise the banner of the cross in Jerusalem and in the ends of
   the earth, they appeal to the power of the Holy Spirit as the secret of
   their appearance.

   The apostolate was holy, and we call them holy apostles, not because
   they had attained a higher degree of perfection, but "holy" in the
   Scriptural sense of being separated, set apart, like the Temple and its
   furniture, for the service of a holy God.

   By sin many things have become unholy. Before sin entered into the
   world all things were holy. That part of creation which became unholy
   stands in opposition to that which remained holy. The latter is called
   Heaven; that which was made holy is called Church. And all that belongs
   to the Church, to its being and organism, is called holy.

   Hence Jesus could say to the disciples who were about to deny Him: "Ye
   are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you." In like
   manner the members of the Church and their children are called
   "sanctified"; and in his epistles St. Paul addresses them as holy and
   beloved: not because they were sinless, but because God had set them as
   called saints in the realm of His holiness, which by His grace He had
   separated from the realm of sin. In like manner the Scripture is called
   holy: not to indicate that it is the record of holy things only, but
   that its origin is not in man's sinful life, but in the holy realm of
   the life of God.

   We confess, therefore, that the apostles of Jesus were set apart for
   the service of God's holy Kingdom, and that they were qualified for
   their calling by the power of the Holy Spirit.

   By omitting the word "holy," as many do, we make the apostles common;
   we consider them as ordinary preachers; in degree above us undoubtedly,
   being more richly developed, especially by their intercourse with
   Christ, and as His witnesses very dear to us, but still occupying the
   same level with other teachers and ministers of the Church of all ages.
   And so the conviction will be lost that the apostles are men different
   in kind from all other men; lost the realization that in them appeared
   a peculiar and unique ministry; lost also the grateful confession that
   the Lord our God gave us in these men extraordinary grace.

   And this explains why some ministers, at the special occasion of
   installation, departure, or jubilee, apply to themselves apostolic
   utterances that are not applicable to their persons, but exclusively to
   the men who occupy a peculiar and unique position in the Church of all
   ages and all lands. For this reason we repeat purposely the title of
   honor, "holy apostles," in order that the peculiar significance of the
   apostolate may again receive honorable recognition in our churches.

   This peculiar significance of the apostolate appears in the Holy
   Scripture in various ways.

   We begin with referring to the prologue of the First Epistle of St.
   John, in which, from the fulness of the apostolic sense, the holy
   apostle solemnly addresses us. He opens his epistle by declaring that
   they, the apostles of the Lord, occupy an exceptional position
   regarding the miracle of the incarnation of the Word. He says: "The
   Word became flesh, and in that incarnate Word, Life was manifested; and
   that that manifested Life was heard and seen and handled with hands."
   By whom? By everybody? No, by the apostles; for he adds emphatically:
   "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, and shew you
   that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto
   us."

   And what was the aim of this declaration? To save souls? Surely this
   also, but not this in the first place. The purpose of this apostolic
   declaration is to bring the members of the Church into connection with
   the abostolate. For, clearly and emphatically, he adds: "This we
   declare unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us." And only
   after this link is closed, and the fellowship with the apostolate an
   accomplished fact, he says: "And truly our fellowship is with the
   Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.

   The apostle's reasoning is as transparent as glass. Life was manifested
   in such a way that it could be seen and handled. They who saw and
   handled it were the apostles; and they were also to declare this life
   unto the elect. By this declaration the required fellowship between the
   elect and the apostolate is established. And in consequence of this,
   there is fellowship also for the elect with the Father and the Son.

   This may not be understood as referring only to the people then living;
   and, regarding Rome, one's position, Bible in hand, is exceedingly weak
   if he maintain that this higher significance of the apostolate had
   reference only to the then living, and not in the same measure to us.
   Indeed, we, upon whom the end of the ages has come, must maintain the
   vital fellowship with the holy apostolate of our Lord Jesus Christ.
   Rome errs by making its bishops the successors of the apostles,
   teaching that fellowship with the apostolate depends upon fellowship
   with Rome: an error which is obvious from the fact that St. John
   expressly and emphatically connects the fellowship of the apostolate
   with men who have seen and heard and handled that which was manifested
   of the Word of Life--something to which no Roman bishop can appeal in
   the present day. Moreover, St. John says distinctly that this
   fellowship with the apostolate must be the result of the declaration of
   the Word of Life by the apostles themselves. And inasmuch as Rome
   established this fellowship not by the preaching of the Word; but by
   the sacramental sign, it is in direct opposition to the apostolic
   doctrine.

   However, from this it follows not that Rome errs in the fundamental
   thought, viv., that every child of God must exercise communion with the
   Father and the Son through the apostolate; on the contrary, this is St.
   John's positive claim. The solution of this apparent conflict lies in
   the fact that they have not only spoken, but also written: i.e., their
   declaration of the Word of Life was not limited to the little circle of
   the men that happened to hear them; on the contrary, by writing they
   have put their preaching into real and enduring forms; they have sent
   it out to all lands and nations; that, as the genuine, ecumenic
   apostles they might bring the testimony of the Life which was
   manifested to all the elect of God in all lands and throughout the
   ages.

   Hence even now the apostles are preaching the living Christ in the
   churches. Their persons have departed, but their personal testimony
   remains. And that personal testimony, which as an apostolic document
   has come to every soul in every land and in every age, is the very
   testimony which even now is the instrument in the hand of the Holy
   Spirit to translate souls into the fellowship of the Life Eternal.

   And if one says, "Surely in this sense their word is still effective;
   however, it results no longer in fellowship with the apostles, and by
   means of this fellowship with Christ, but it points us directly to the
   Savior of our souls, which is a more simple way," then we oppose this
   unscriptural notion most energetically.

   Such reasoning ignores the body of Christ and overlooks the great fact
   of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. There is not the saving of a few
   individual souls, but a bringing together of the body of Christ; and
   into that body every one that is called must be incorporated. And
   inasmuch as the King of the Church gives His Sprit now not to separate
   persons, but exclusively to them that are incorporated, and the
   inflowing of the Holy Spirit into this body, and principally in the
   persons of the apostles, took place on Pentecost, therefore no one can
   receive at the present time any spiritual gift or influence of the Holy
   Spirit unless he stands in vital connection with the body of the Lord;
   and that body is unthinkable without the apostles.

   In fact, the apostolic Word comes to the soul to-day as the testimony
   of what they have seen and heard and handled of the Word of Life. By
   virtue of this testimony souls are inwardly wrought upon, and by their
   being incorporated into the body of Christ they become manifest. And
   this fellowship becomes manifest as a fellowship with the very body of
   which the apostles are the leaders, in whose persons and in the persons
   of whose associates the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of
   Pentecost.

   We know that this view, or this confession rather, is in direct
   opposition to the view of Methodism, [14] which has pervaded all
   classes and conditions of men. And the deplorable results have become
   apparent in various ways. Methodism has killed the conscious
   appreciation of the sacrament; it is cold and indifferent toward church
   fellowship; it has cultivated an unlimited disregard for truth in the
   confession. [15] And while the Lord our God has deemed it necessary to
   give us a voluminous Holy Scripture, consisting of six-and-sixty books,
   Methodism has boasted that it could write its Gospel upon a dime.

   This error can not be overcome, except the Word of God become again our
   Teacher and we its docile scholars. And then we shall learn--

   (1) Not that a few isolated persons are being rescued from the floods
   of iniquity, but that a body will be redeemed.

   (2) That all that are to be saved will be incorporated into that body.

   (3) That this body has Christ as its Head and the apostles as its
   permanent leaders.

   (4) That on Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out into that body.

   (5) That even now each of us experiences the gracious operations of the
   Holy Spirit only through fellowship with this body.

   Only when these things are clear to the soul, the glorious word of
   Christ, "Father, I pray not for these alone, but for them also which
   shall believe on Me through their word," will be well understood. Taken
   in the current sense, this word has not the least comfort for us; for
   then the Lord has prayed only for these then living, who had the
   privilege of personally hearing the apostles, and who were converted by
   their verbal testimony. We are entirely excluded. But if this petition
   be taken in the sense indicated above, as tho Christ would say, "I pray
   not for My apostles alone, but also for them who through their
   testimony shall believe on Me, now and in all ages and lands and
   nations," then it acquires widest scope, and contains a prayer for
   every child of God called even now and from our own households.

   This unique significance of the apostolate is so deeply embedded in the
   heart of the Kingdom, that when in the Revelation of St. John we get a
   glimpse of the New Jerusalem, we see that the city has twelve
   foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the
   Lamb--Rev. xxi. 14. Hence their significance is not transient and
   temporary, but permanent and including the whole Church. And when its
   warfare shall be ended and the glory of the New Jerusalem shall be
   revealed, even then, in its heavenly bliss, the Church shall rest upon
   the very foundation on which it was built here, and therefore bear,
   engraven on its twelve foundations, the names of the holy apostles of
   the Lord.

   The apostle Paul considers the apostolate so glorious and exalted that
   in his Epistle to the Hebrews he applies the name of Apostle to the
   Lord Jesus Christ. "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly
   calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
   Jesus." The meaning is perfectly clear. Properly speaking, it is Christ
   Himself calling and testifying in His Church. But as the white ray of
   light divides itself into many colors, so does Christ impart Himself to
   His twelve apostles, whom He has set as the instruments through whom He
   has fellowship with His Church. Hence the apostles stand not each by
   himself, but together they constitute the apostolate, the unity of
   which is found not in St. Peter nor in St. Paul, but in Christ. If we
   should wish to comprehend the whole apostolate in one, it must be He in
   whom is contained the fulness of the twelve--the Apostle and High
   Priest of our profession, Christ the Lord.

   Not until we fully grasp these thoughts and live in them shall we be
   able to understand the epistles of St. Paul, and appreciate his
   spiritual conflict to maintain the honor of the apostolate for his
   divine mission. Especially in his epistles to the Corinthians and
   Galatians he sustains this conflict bravely and effectually; but in
   such a way that the Methodist can not have eye or ear for it. He rather
   feels like deploring the apostle's zeal, saying: "If Paul had insisted
   less on his title and more humbly applied himself to the conversion of
   souls, his memory would have been much more precious." And from his
   standpoint he is quite right. If the apostolate has no higher
   significance than to be the first teachers and ministers of the Church,
   then there can be no reason why St. Paul should waste his strength
   contending for a meaningless title.

   But the undeniable fact that St. Paul's energetic contending agrees not
   with the current opinions of the present time ought to make us oppose
   the notion that, since his contention does not comport with our
   opinions, he must be wrong! and acknowledge that the standpoint which
   we can not occupy without condemning the apostle must be abandoned--the
   sooner the better. St. Paul must not conform himself to our opinions,
   but our opinions must be modified or altered according to St. Paul's.

  XXX.

  The Apostolic Scriptures.

   "And I think that I also have the Spirit of God."--1 Cor. vii. 40.

   We have seen that the apostolate has an extraordinary significance and
   occupies a unique position. This position is twofold, viz., temporary,
   with reference to the founding of the first churches, and permanent,
   with regard to the churches of all ages.

   The first must necessarily be temporary, for what was then accomplished
   can not be repeated. A tree can be planted only once; an organism can
   be born only once; the planting or founding of the Church could take
   place only once. However, this founding was not unprepared for. On the
   contrary, God has had a Church in the world from the beginning. That
   Church was even a world-Church. But it went down in idolatry; and only
   a small Church remained among an almost unknown people--the Church in
   Israel. When this particular Church was to become again a world-Church,
   two things were required:

   First, that the Church in Israel lay aside its national dress.

   Secondly, that in the midst of the heathen world the Church of Christ
   appear, so that the two might become manifest as the one Christian
   Church.

   By these two things the apostolic labor is almost exhausted. In St.
   Paul the two are united. No apostle labored more zealously to divest
   the Church of Israel of its Jewish attire, and no one was more abundant
   in the planting of new churches in all parts of the world.

   The apostolate had, however, a much more extensive and higher calling,
   not only for those days, but also for the Church of the ages. It was
   the task of the apostles for which they were, ordained: by giving to
   the churches fixed forms of government to determine their character;
   and by the written documentation of the revelation of Christ Jesus to
   secure to them purity and perpetuity.

   This is evident from the character of their labors: for they not only
   founded churches, but also gave them ordinances. St. Paul writes to the
   Corinthians: "As I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so
   do ye" (1 Cor. xvi. 1). Hence they were conscious of possessing power,
   of being clothed with authority: "And so ordain I in all the churches,"
   says the same apostle (1 Cor. vii. 17). This ordaining is not like that
   of our official church boards which have power to make rules; or as a
   minister in the name of the consistory announces from the pulpit
   certain regulations. Nay, the apostles exercised authority by virtue of
   a power they consciously possessed in themselves, independent of any
   church or church council. For St. Paul writes, after having given
   ordinances in the matter of marriages: "And I think that I also have
   the Spirit of God." (1 Cor. vii. 40) Hence the power and authority to
   command, to ordain and to judge in the churches, they derived not from
   the Church, nor from church council, nor from the apostolate, but
   directly from the Holy Spirit. This is true even of the power to judge;
   for, concerning an incestuous person in the church of Corinth, St. Paul
   judged that he should be delivered to Satan; the execution of which
   sentence he left to the elders of that church, but upon which he had
   determined by virtue of his apostolic authority--1 Cor. v. 3.

   In this connection it is remarkable that St. Paul was conscious of a
   twofold current running through his word: (1) that of tradition,
   touching the things ordained by the Lord Jesus during His ministry; and
   (2) that of the Holy Spirit, touching the things to be decided by the
   apostolate. For he writes: "Now concerning virgins, I have no
   commandment of the Lord; yet I give my judgment as one that hath
   obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful" (1 Cor. vii. 25). And again
   he saith: "Unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not
   the wife depart from her husband" (ver. 10). And in verse 12 he saith:
   "But to the rest speak I, not the Lord." Many have received the
   impression that St. Paul meant to say: "What the Lord commanded, you
   must keep; but the things by me enjoined are of less account and not
   binding";--a view destroying the authority of the apostolic word, and
   therefore to be rejected. The apostle has not the least intention of
   undermining his own authority; for having delivered the message, he
   adds expressly: "And I think that I also have the Spirit of God"; (1
   Cor. vii. 40) which, in connection with the commandment of the Lord,
   can not mean anything else than this: "That which I have enjoined rests
   upon the same authority as the Lord's own words";--a declaration which
   was already contained in the word: "I have received mercy to be
   faithful," i.e., in my work of regulating the churches.

   By these ordinances and regulations the apostles not only gave to the
   churches of those days a fixed form of life, but they also prepared the
   channel that was to determine the future course of the life of the
   Church. They did this in two ways:

   First, partly by the impressions they made upon the life of the
   churches, and which were never wholly obliterated.

   Secondly, partly also and more particularly by leaving us in writing
   the image of that Church, and by sealing the principal features of
   these ordinances in their apostolic epistles.

   Both these influences, that directly on the life of the churches, and
   that of the apostolic Scriptures, have taken care that the image of the
   Church should not be lost, and that, where it was in danger of such
   loss, by the grace of God it should be fully restored.

   This leads us to consider the second activity of the apostles, whereby
   they operated upon the Church of all ages, viz., the in heritance of
   their writings.

   Our writings are the richest and maturest products of the mind; and the
   mind of the Holy Spirit received its richest, fullest, and most perfect
   expression when His meaning was put into documental form. The literary
   labor of the apostles deserves, therefore, careful attention.

   When the apostles Peter and Paul preached the Gospel, healed the sick,
   judged the unruly, and founded churches, giving them ordinances, they
   performed in each of these a great and glorious work. And yet the
   significance of St. Paul's labor when he wrote, e.g., the Epistle to
   the Romans so far surpassed the value of preaching and healing that the
   two can not be compared. When he wrote that one little book, which in
   ordinary pamphlet form would make no more than three sheets of printed
   matter, he performed the greatest work of his life. From this little
   book the most far-reaching influences have gone forth. By this one
   little book St. Paul became a historic person.

   We know, indeed, that many of our present theologians reverse this
   order, and say: "These apostles were profoundly spiritual men; they
   lived near the Lord and had entered deeply into the mind of Christ;
   they labored and preached and occasionally wrote a few letters, some of
   which have come down to us; yet this letter-writing was of little
   significance to their persons"; but against this whole representation
   we protest with all our might. Nay, these men were not such excellent
   personalities that the few occasional letters from their hands could
   scarcely have any significance in their lives. On the contrary, their
   epistolary labor was the most important of all their lifework; small in
   compass, but rich in content; apparently of less, but by virtue of its
   comprehensive and far-reaching influence of much higher significance.
   And since the apostles may not be considered half-idiots, knowing
   scarcely anything of the future of the Church, and without any
   realization of what they were doing, we maintain that a man like St.
   Paul, having finished his Epistle to the Romans, was indeed conscious
   of the fact that this work would occupy a prominent place among his
   apostolic labors.

   Even tho it be granted that the apostle was unconscious of it, yet this
   alters not the fact. To-day, when the churches founded eighteen
   centuries ago have all past away, and the church of Rome can scarcely
   be recognized; when the people who by his wonderful power were healed
   or saved have all crumbled to dust, and not a single memory remains of
   all his other toil; to-day his epistolary inheritance still governs the
   Church of Christ.

   We can not conceive what the condition of the Church would be without
   St. Paul's epistles; if we were to lose the inheritance of the great
   apostle that has come to us through our fathers. What is it that
   controls our confession, if not the truths developed by him; what is it
   that governs our lives, if not the ideals so highly exalted by him? We
   can safely say, with reference to our own Church, that without the
   Pauline epistles its whole form and appearance would be totally
   different.

   This being so, we are also justified in saying that the objectifying of
   Christian truth in the apostolic epistles is the most important of all
   their labors. Instead of calling it a "dead-letter," we confess that in
   it their activity reached its very zenith.

   However, the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit in the apostolate being
   the subject of our present inquiry, and not the apostolate itself, we
   will consider now the serious question: What is the nature of this
   work?

   Our choice lies between the theory of the mechanical, and that of the
   natural, process.

   The supporters of the first say: "Nothing can be more simple than the
   work of the Holy Spirit in the apostles. They had only to sit down,
   take pen and ink, and write at His dictation." The advocates of the
   natural process state its case as follows: "The apostles had entered
   more deeply into the mind of Christ; they were holier, purer, and more
   godly than others; hence they were better fitted to be the instruments
   of the Holy Spirit, who after all animates every child of God." These
   are the extreme views. On the one hand, the work of the Holy Spirit is
   considered as a foreign element introduced into the life of the Church
   and that of the apostles. Any schoolboy competent to write a dictation
   might have written the Epistle to the Romans just as well as St. Paul.
   The obvious difference of style and manner of presentation between his
   epistles and those of St. John does not spring from the difference of
   personalities, but from the fact that the Holy Spirit purposely adopted
   the style and way of speaking of His chosen scribe, be he St. Paul or
   St. John.

   The other extreme considers that the persons of the apostles account
   for the whole matter; so that to speak of a work of the Holy Spirit is
   only to repeat a pious term. According to this view, the influence of
   Christ's personal intercourse had an educating effect upon His
   disciples, which left such impress of His life upon them that they
   could understand His Person and aims much better than others; hence
   being the best-developed minds of the Christian circle of those days,
   they adopted in their writings--a certain apostolic authority.

   Besides these two extremes, we must mention the view of certain
   friendly theologians who turn this natural into a supernatural, but
   still self-developed, process. They acknowledge, with us, that there is
   a work of the Holy Spirit which they also call regeneration, and allow
   that to this the gift of illumination is often added. And from this
   they argue: "Among the regenerated there are some in whom this divine
   work is only superficial, and others in whom He operates more deeply.
   In the former; the gift of illumination is undeveloped; in the latter,
   it attains great luster; and it is to this class that the apostles
   belonged, who were partakers of this gift in its highest degree. Owing
   to these two gifts, the work of the Holy Spirit attained in them such
   clearness and transparency that, in speaking or writing concerning the
   things of the Kingdom of God, they struck almost invariably the right
   note, chose the right word, and continued in the right direction. Hence
   the power of their writings, and the almost binding authority of their
   word."

   Over against these three opponents we wish to present the view of the
   best theologians of the Christian Church, which, altho fully
   appreciating the effects of regeneration and illumination in the
   apostles, still maintain that from these the infallible, apostolic
   authority can not be explained; and that the authority of their word is
   recognized only by the unconditional confession that these operations
   of grace were but the means used by the Holy Spirit when, through the
   apostles, He cast His own testimony into documental forms for the
   Church of all ages.

  Apostolic Inspiration.

   "When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all
   truth."--John xvi. 13.

   What is the nature of the work of the Holy Spirit in the inspiration of
   the apostles?

   Apart from the mechanical and natural theories, which are vulgar and
   profane, there are two others, viz., the Ethical and the Reformed.

   According to the former the inspiration of the apostles differs from
   the animation of believers only in degree, not in nature. They
   represent the matter as tho, by the incarnation of the Word, a new
   sphere of life was created which they call the "God-human." They that
   have received the life of this higher sphere are called believers;
   others are unbelievers. In these believers the consciousness is
   gradually changed, illuminated, and sanctified. Hence they see things
   in a different light, i.e., their eyes are opened so that they see much
   of the spiritual world of which unbelievers see nothing. However, this
   result is not the same in all believers. The more favored see more
   correctly and distinctly than the less favored. And the most excellent
   among them, who possess this God-human life most abundantly, and look
   into the things of the, Kingdom with greatest clearness and
   distinctness, are the men called apostles. Hence the inspiration of the
   apostles and the illumination of believers are in principle the same;
   differing only in degree.

   The Reformed churches can not agree with this view. In their judgment
   the very effort to identify apostolic inspiration with the illumination
   of believers actually annihilates the former. They hold that the
   inspiration of the apostles was wholly unique in nature and kind,
   totally different from what the Scripture calls illumination of
   believers. The apostles possessed this latter gift even in its highest
   degree, and we heartily indorse all that the Ethical theologians say in
   this respect. But, when all is said, we hold that apostolic inspiration
   is not even touched upon; that it lies entirely outside of it; is not
   contained in, but added to, it; and that the Church must reverence it
   as an extraordinary, peculiar, and unique work of the Holy Spirit,
   which was wrought exclusively in the holy apostles.

   Hence both sides concede that the apostles were born again, that they
   had received illumination in a peculiarly high degree. But while the
   Ethical theorists maintain that this extraordinary illumination
   includes inspiration, the Reformed hold that illumination in its
   highest degree has nothing to do with inspiration; which was unique in
   its kind, without equal, given to the apostles alone; never to other
   believers.

   The difference between the two views is obvious.

   According to the Ethical view, the epistles are the writings of very
   worthy, godly, and sanctified men; the thoughtful utterances of highly
   enlightened believers. And yet, having said all this, they are after
   all only fallible; they may contain ninety per cent of truth, well
   expressed and accurately defined; but the possibility remains that the
   other ten per cent is full of errors and mistakes Even tho there be one
   or more infallible epistles, how can this avail us, since we do not
   know it? In fact, we are without the least certainty in this matter.
   And for this reason it is actually conceded that the apostles have made
   mistakes.

   Hence the Reformed churches can not accept this fascinating
   representation; and the conscience of believers will always protest
   against it. What we expect in "holy apostles" is this very certainty,
   reliability, and decision. Reading their testimony, we want to rely
   upon it. This certainty alone has been the strength of the Church of
   all ages. This conviction alone has given her rest. And the Church of
   to-day feels as instinctively that the reliability of the Word that is
   its Bible is being taken away from it, inasmuch as, these beautifully
   sounding theories strip the apostolic word of its infallibility.

   The holy apostles appear in their writings as such, and not otherwise.
   St. John, the most beloved among the twelve, testifies that the Lord
   Jesus gave them as apostles a rare promise, saying, "He shall guide you
   into all truth," (John xvi. 13) a word that may not be applied to
   others, but to the apostles exclusively. And again: "The Comforter
   which is the Holy Ghost shall teach you all things, and bring to your
   remembrance all things whatsoever I have said unto you." (John xiv.
   26); which promise was not intended for all, but for the apostles only,
   securing them a gift evidently distinct from illumination. In fact,
   this promise was nothing else than the permanent endowment with the
   gift received only temporarily when they went forth on their first
   mission among Israel: "For it is, not you that speak, but the Spirit of
   your Father which speaketh in you." (Matt. x. 20)

   Moreover, the Lord Jesus did not only promise them that the word
   proceeding from their mouth would be a word of the Holy Spirit, but He
   granted them such personal power and authority that it would be as tho
   God Himself spoke through them. St. Paul testified of this to the
   church of Thessalonica, saying: "For this cause we thank God that ye
   received it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the Word of
   God" (1 Thess. ii. 13). And St. John tells us that, both before and
   after the resurrection, the Lord Jesus gave His disciples power to bind
   on earth in the sense that their word would have binding power forever:
   "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
   whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained"; -- (John xx. 23) words
   that are horrible and untenable except they be understood as implying
   perfect agreement between the minds of the apostles and the mind of
   God. Of similar import are the words of Christ to Peter: "Whatsoever
   thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou
   shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." (Matt. xvi. 19)

   However, reading and pondering these remarkable and weighty words, let
   us be careful not to fall into the error of Rome, or, in order to
   escape from this, make the Word of God of no effect, which is equally
   dangerous. For the Church of Rome applies these words of Jesus to His
   disciples, to the whole Church as an institution; especially the word
   to Peter, making it to refer to all Peter's successors (so-called) in
   the government of the Church of Rome. If that be indeed the meaning of
   these words, then Rome is perfectly right; then to the Pope is granted
   power to bind, and the priests of Rome have still the power to absolve.
   Our reason for denying that Rome has this power is not the
   impossibility for men to have it, for it was given to the apostles;
   Peter was infallible in his sentences ex cathedra, and the apostles
   could grant absolution. But we deny that Rome has the slightest
   authority to confer this power of Peter upon the Pope, or that of the
   apostles upon its priests. Neither Matt. xvi. 19 nor John xx. 23
   contains the least proof for such claim. And inasmuch as no man has the
   liberty to exercise such extraordinary power except he can show the
   credential's of his mission, so we deny Rome's qualifications to
   exercise it in pope or priest, not because this is impossible, but
   because Rome can not substantiate its claims.

   At the same time, let us, in our contending with Rome, not fall into
   the opposite error of disparaging the plain and clear meaning of the
   word. This is done by the Ethical theologians; for the words of Jesus
   referred to do not receive justice so long as we refuse to recognize in
   the apostles a working of the Holy Spirit entirely peculiar, unique,
   and extraordinary. We dilute the words of Jesus and violate their sense
   so long as we do not acknowledge that, if the apostles were still
   living, they would have the power to forgive us our sins; and that
   Peter, if he were still living, would have power and authority to issue
   ordinances binding upon the whole Church. The words are so plain, the
   qualification was granted in such definite terms, that it can not be
   denied that John could forgive sin, and that Peter had power to issue
   an infallible decree. The Lord said to the disciples: "Whosesoever sins
   ye remit, they are remitted unto them" (John xx. 23); and to Peter:
   "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven." (Matt.
   xvi. 19)

   Thus acknowledging the unique position and extraordinary power of the
   apostles, we immediately add that this power was granted to them alone
   and to no one else.

   We emphasize this in opposition to Rome and to those who apply the
   words of Christ, spoken to His disciples exclusively, to ministers and
   other believers. Neither Rome nor the Ethical theologians have the
   right to do this, unless they can show that the Lord Jesus gave them
   such right. But they never can. Care should be taken, therefore, in the
   choice of texts, proofs, and quotations from the Scripture, to
   ascertain not only what is said, but also to whom it was said. And thus
   the error concerning the apostolate will soon be overcome; and
   believers will see that the apostles occupy a different position from
   other Christians, that the promises quoted bear an exceptional
   character, and that the Word of the Lord is misunderstood when
   inspiration is confounded with illumination.

   In opposition to these wrong views, which are Romish, clerical in
   principle, and at the same time strongly tending to rationalism, we
   maintain the ancient confession of the Christian Church, which declares
   that, as the ambassadors extraordinary of Christ, the apostles occupied
   a unique position in the race, in the Church, and in the history of the
   world, and were clothed with extraordinary powers that required an
   extraordinary operation of the Holy Spirit.

   But we do not deny that these men were born again and partakers of the
   heavenly illumination; so that the man of sin was driven back, and the
   new man was powerfully revealed in them. But their personal state and
   condition was the cause of their continued sinfulness until the hour of
   their death; hence their infallible authority could never spring from
   the fallible condition of their hearts. Even tho they had been less
   sinful, such power could not be thus accounted for. And if they had
   fallen more deeply into sin, it would not have hindered the Holy
   Spirit's operation with reference to the exercise of this authority. It
   is remarkable that Peter, who was clothed with the highest power, fell
   again and again into great sin. They were saints because they were hid
   in Christ like other Christians; but they were holy apostles not on the
   ground of their spiritual state and condition, but only by virtue of
   their holy calling and the working of the Holy Spirit that was promised
   and given unto them.

   Finally, the question arises, whether there was a difference between
   the operation of the Holy Spirit in the prophets and in the apostles.
   We answer in the affirmative. Ezekiel's oracles are different from St.
   John's Gospel. The Epistle to the Romans bears witness to a different
   inspiration from that of the prophecies of Zacharias. Undoubtedly the
   book of Revelation proves that the apostles were also susceptible to
   inspiration by visions; the book of the Acts is evidence that in those
   days there were also wonderful signs; and St. Paul speaks of visions
   and ecstasies. And yet the collective treasure that came down to us
   under the apostles' name bears evidence that the inspiration of the New
   Testament has another character than that of the Old. And the principal
   difference consists in the mighty fact of the outpouring of the Holy
   Spirit.

   The prophets were inspired before Pentecost, and the apostles after it.
   This fact is so strongly marked in the history of their mission that
   before it the apostles sit still, while immediately after it they
   appear in their apostolic character before the world. And since in the
   outpouring the Holy Spirit came to dwell in the body of Christ, which
   before He had been preparing, it is obvious that the difference of
   inspiration in the Old and the New Testament consists in the fact that
   the former was wrought upon the prophets from without, while the latter
   wrought upon the apostles from within, proceeding from the body of
   Christ.

   And this is the reason that the prophets give us more or less the
   impression of an inspiration independent of their personal, spiritual
   life, while the inspiration of the apostles acts almost always through
   the life of the soul. It is this very fact that offers to the error of
   the Ethical view its starting-point. Surely the person and his
   condition appear in the apostles much more in the foreground than in
   the prophets. And yet in both prophet and apostle inspiration is that
   wholly extraordinary operation of the Holy Spirit whereby, in a manner
   for us incomprehensible and to them not always conscious, they were
   kept from the possibility of error.

  Apostles To-Day?

   "Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our
   Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord?"--1 Cor. ix. 1.

   We may not take leave of the apostolate without a last look at the
   circle of its members. It is a closed circle; and every effort to
   reopen it tends to efface a characteristic of the New Covenant.

   And yet the effort is being made again and again. We see it in Rome's
   apostolic succession; in the Ethical view gradually effacing the
   boundary-line between the apostles and believers; and in its boldest
   and most concrete form among the Irvingites. [16]

   The latter assert not only that the Lord gave to His Church a college
   of apostles in the beginning, but that He has now called a body of
   apostles in His Church to prepare His people for the coming.

   However, this position can not be very successfully supported. Neither
   in the discourses of Christ, nor in the epistles of the apostles, nor
   in the Apocalypse, do we find the least intimation of such an event.
   The end of all things is repeatedly spoken of. The New Testament
   frequently rehearses the events and signs that must precede the Lord's
   return. They are recorded so minutely that some even say that the exact
   date can be fixed. And yet, among all these prophecies, we fail to
   discover the slightest sign of a subsequent apostolate. In the panorama
   of the things to come there is literally no room for it.

   Nor have the results realized the expectations of these brethren. Their
   apostolate has been a great disappointment. It has accomplished almost
   nothing. It has come and gone without leaving a trace. We do not deny
   that some of these men have done wonderful things; but be it noticed,
   in the first place, that the signs wrought were far below those
   performed by the apostles; second, that a man like Pastor Blumhardt has
   also wrought signs that greatly deserve to be noticed; third, that the
   Roman Catholic Church sometimes offers signs that are not pretended nor
   artificial; lastly, that the Lord has warned us in His Word that signs
   shall be wrought by men who are not His own.

   Moreover, let us not forget that the apostles of the Irvingites
   completely lack the marks of the apostolate. These were: (1) a call
   directly from the King of the Church; (2) a peculiar qualification of
   the Holy Spirit making them infallible in the service of the Church.
   These men lack both marks. They tell us, indeed, of a call come to them
   by the mouth of prophets, but this is to little or no purpose, for a
   call from a prophet is not equal to one directly from Christ, and again
   the name "prophet" is exceedingly misleading. The word prophet has, on
   the sacred page, a wide application, and occurs in both a limited and a
   general sense. The former involves the revelation of a knowledge that
   mere illumination does not afford; while the latter applies to men
   speaking in holy ecstasy to the praise of God. We concede that
   prophesying, in the general sense, is an enduring charisma of the
   Church; for which reason the reformers of the sixteenth century
   attempted to revive this office. If the Irvingites, therefore, believe
   that in their circles the prophetic activity has been revived, we will
   not dispute it; altho we can not say that the reports of their
   prophesying have had a very overwhelming effect upon us. However, let
   it be granted that the gift has been restored; but even then we ask:
   What do you gain by it? For there is not the slightest proof that these
   prophets and prophetesses are like their predecessors in the Old
   Testament. The unrevealed will of God has not been revealed to them. If
   prophets at all, then their prophesying is merely a speaking to the
   praise of God in a state of spiritual ecstasy.

   The uselessness of an appeal to such prophets for the support of this
   new apostolate is evident. It is merely the effort to support an
   unsupported apostolate by an equally unsupported prophetism.

   Nor should it be forgotten that the labors of these so-called apostles
   have not carried out their own program. They have failed to exert any
   perceptible influence upon the course of events. The institutions
   founded by them have in no respect surpassed the many new church
   organizations witnessed by this century. They have established no new
   principle; their labors have manifested no new power. Whatever they
   have done lacks the stamp of a heavenly origin. And nearly all these
   new apostles have died not like the genuine twelve on cross or stake,
   but on their own beds surrounded by their friends and admirers.

   However, this is not all. The name of apostle may be taken (1) in the
   sense of being called directly by Jesus as an ambassador for. God, or
   (2) in a general sense, denoting every man sent by Jesus into His
   vineyard; for the word apostle means one that is sent. In Acts xiv. 14
   Barnabas is called an apostle: not because he belonged to their number,
   but merely to indicate that he was sent out by the Lord as His
   missionary or ambassador. In Acts xiii. 1, 2 Barnabas is mentioned
   before Saul, who is not even called by his apostolic name; which shows
   that this call of the Holy Spirit bore only a temporary character,
   having in view only this special mission. For this reason the Lord
   Jesus Christ, as the One sent of the Father, the great Missionary come
   to this world, the Ambassador of God to His Church, is celled Apostle:
   "Wherefore, holy brethren, . . . consider the Apostle and High Priest
   of our confession, Christ Jesus" (Heb. iii. 1).

   If the Irvingites had called the great reformers of the sixteenth
   century, or some prominent churchleaders of the present time, apostles,
   there could have been no great objection. But they did not mean this.
   They claim that these new apostles shall stand before the Church in a
   peculiar character, on the same plane with the first apostles, altho
   differently employed. And this can not be conceded. It would be in
   direct opposition to the apostolic declaration of 1 Cor. iv. 9: "For I
   think that God hath set us forth as the last apostles, as it were
   appointed unto death" (see Dutch translation). How could St. Paul speak
   of the last apostles, if it were God's plan after eighteen centuries to
   send other twelve apostles into the world?

   In view of this positive word of the Holy Spirit, we direct all those
   that come into contact with the Irvingites to what the Scripture says
   concerning them that call themselves apostles, and are not: "For such
   men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into
   apostles of Christ." And the Lord Jesus testifies to the church at
   Ephesus: "I know that thou halt tried them which say they are apostles
   and are not."

   The notion that false apostles must be a sort of incarnate devils
   applies in no wise to the calm, respectable, and venerable men
   frequently seen in the circles of the Irvingites. But apart from this
   absurd notion, and considering that the false prophets of the Old
   Testament so closely resembled the true ones that at times even the
   people of God were deceived by them, we can understand that the false
   apostles of St. John's day could be detected only by a higher spiritual
   discernment: and that the pretended apostles of the nineteenth century,
   who by their similarity to the genuine twelve blinded the eyes of the
   superficial, could be detected only by the touchstone of the Word of
   God. And that Word declares that the twelve of St. Paul's day were the
   last apostles, which settles the matter of this pretended apostolate.

   This error of the Irvingites is therefore not so very innocent. It is
   easy to explain how it originated. The wretched and deplorable state of
   the Church must necessarily give rise to a number of sects. And we
   heartily acknowledge that the Irvingites have sent forth many warnings
   and well-deserved rebukes to our superficial and divided Church. But
   these good offices by no means justify the doing of things condemned by
   the Word of God; and those who have allowed themselves to be carried
   away by their teachings will sooner or later experience their fatal
   result. It is already manifest that this movement, which started among
   us under the pretext of uniting a divided church by gathering together
   the Lord's people, has accomplished little more than to add another to
   the already large number of sects, thus robbing the Church of Christ of
   excellent powers that now are being wasted.

   That the apostolate was a closed circle, and not a flexible theory, is
   evident from Acts i. 25: "Lord, show of these two, the one whom Thou
   hast chosen to take the place of this ministry and apostleship"; and
   again from St. Paul's word (Rom. i. 5): "By whom we have received grace
   and apostleship"; and again (1 Cor. ix. 2): "For the seal of my
   apostleship are ye in the Lord"; and lastly from Gal. ii. 8: "For He
   that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision,
   wrought for me also unto the Gentiles." And again it is evident from
   the fact that the apostles always appear as the twelve; and from their
   being specially appointed and installed by Jesus breathing upon them
   the official gift of the Holy Spirit; and from the exceptional power
   and gifts that were connected with the apostolate. And it is especially
   from its conspicuous place in the coming Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
   Christ that the apostolate obtains its definite character. For the Holy
   Scripture teaches that the apostles shall sit upon twelve thrones
   judging the twelve tribes of Israel; and also that the New Jerusalem
   has "twelve foundations upon which are written the twelve names of the
   apostles of the Lamb." (Rev. xii. 14)

   St. Paul offers us in his own person the most convincing proof that the
   apostolate was a closed college. If it had not been, the question
   whether he was an apostle or not could never have caused contention.
   Yet a large part of the Church refused to acknowledge his apostleship.
   He did not belong to the twelve; he had not walked with Jesus; how
   could he be a witness? It was against this seriously meant contention
   that St. Paul repeatedly lifted up his voice with such energy and
   animation. This fact is the key to the right understanding of his
   epistles to the Corinthians and Galatians. They glow with holy jealousy
   for the reality of his apostleship; for he was deeply convinced that he
   was an apostle as well as St. Peter and the others. Not by virtue of
   personal merit; in himself he was not worthy to be called an apostle--1
   Cor. xv. 9; but no sooner is his office assailed than he arouses
   himself like a lion, for this touched the honor of his Master, who had
   appeared unto him in the way to Damascus; not, as is commonly said, to,
   convert him--for this is not Christ's work, but that of the Holy
   Spirit--but to appoint him an apostle in that Church which he was
   persecuting.

   As to the question, how the addition of St. Paul to the twelve is
   consistent with that number, we are convinced that not the name of
   Matthias, but that of St. Paul is written upon the foundations of the
   New Jerusalem with those of the others; and that not Matthias, but St.
   Paul shall sit down to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. As one of the
   tribes of Israel was replaced by two others, so in regard to the
   apostolate; for Simeon, who fell out, Manasseh and Ephraim were
   substituted, and Judas was replaced by Matthias and Paul.

   We would not imply that the apostles erred in electing Matthias to fill
   the vacancy occasioned by the suicide of Judas. On the contrary, the
   completion of the apostolic number could not be delayed until the
   conversion of St. Paul. The vacancy had to be filled immediately. But
   it may be said that when the disciples chose Matthias they had too
   small a conception of the goodness of their Lord. They supposed that
   for Judas they would receive a Matthias, and behold, Jesus gave them a
   Paul. As to the former, the Scripture mentions his election and no
   more. Yet even tho to the Church of later times the apostolate without
   St. Paul is unthinkable, and tho it allowed his person the first place
   among the apostles and his writings highest in authority among the
   Scriptures of the New Testament, to the person of Matthias the election
   to the apostolate must have brought highest honor. The apostolate
   stands so high that the fact of having been identified with it, even
   temporarily, imparts greater luster to a man's name than a royal crown.

  The Holy Scriptures in the New Testament.

   "But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
   the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His
   name."--John xx. 31.

   Having considered the apostolate, we are now to discuss God's gift to
   the Church, viz. the New Testament Scripture.

   The apostolate placed a new power in the Church.

   Surely all power is in heaven; but it has pleased God to let this power
   descend in the Church by means of organs and instruments, chief among
   which is the apostolate. This organ was a consolation of the Comforter,
   given to the Church after Jesus had ascended to heaven and was
   provisionally not to govern His Church in person. Hence it was a
   forsaken Church, not yet planted, and soon to be scattered, to which
   the Holy Spirit gave the apostolate as a bond of union, as an organ for
   self-extension, and as an instrument for its own enrichment with the
   full knowledge of the life of grace. Commissioned by the King of the
   Church, the apostles were animated by the Holy Spirit. As the King
   works for His Church only by the Spirit, so He caused the apostolate to
   work also by the higher powers of the Holy Spirit.

   It was not the Lord's intention that His Church should set out in
   ignorance, to wander about in manifold error, finally the long journey
   ended, to arrive at a clearer perception of the truth; but that from
   the beginning it should stand in the light of complete knowledge. Hence
   He gave it the apostolate, that from the cradle of its existence it
   should receive the full sunshine of grace, and that no subsequent
   development of Christendom should ever surpass that of the apostles.

   This is a very significant fact.

   Indeed, in the course of history there is development, especially in
   doctrine, which has not yet ceased, and which will continue until the
   end. The King has cast His Church into the midst of warfare and
   trouble; He has not permitted it to confess His name in an unmanly and
   indolent manner, but from age to age He has compelled it to defend that
   confession against error, misunderstanding, and hostility. It is only
   in this warfare that it has learned gradually to exhibit every part of
   its glorious inheritance of truth. God shall judge heretics; but,
   besides much mischief, they have rendered the Church this excellent
   service of compelling it to wake up from slumbering upon its
   gold-mines, to explore them, and to open the hidden treasure.

   Hence our conscious insight into the truth is deeper than that of the
   preceding centuries. Semper excelsior! Ever higher! Research into holy
   things may never cease; even now the Lord fulfils His promise to every
   true theologian: "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
   find." (Luke xi. 9) And in the development of the consciousness of the
   Church concerning its treasure of truth, the Holy Spirit has a special
   work, and he who denies it leaves the Church to petrify and is blind
   for the word of the Lord.

   Yet, however great its present and future progress, it will never
   possess a grain of truth more than when the apostolate passed away.
   Afterward the gold-mine might be explored; but when the apostles died
   the mine itself existed already. Nothing can be added to it or ever
   will; it is complete in itself. For this reason the great men of God,
   who, in the course of ages, by brave words have animated the Church,
   have always pointed back to the treasures of the apostles, and without
   exception told the churches: "Your treasure lies not before, but behind
   you, and dates from the days of the apostles."

   And herein was mercy; any other disposition would have been unmerciful.
   The people of one or eighteen centuries ago had the same spiritual
   needs as we have; nothing less than we have could suffice for them.
   Their wounds are ours; the balm of Gilead that has healed us, healed
   them also. Consequently the remedy for souls must be ready for
   immediate use. Delay would be cruel. Hence it is not strange and
   problematic, but perfectly in accord with God's mercy, that the whole
   treasure of saving truth was given to the Church directly in the first
   century:

   To accomplish this was the mission of the apostolate. It is like
   medical science in this respect, which makes constant progress in the
   knowledge of herbs. But however great that progress, no new herb has
   been produced. Those that exist now, existed always, having the same
   medicinal properties. The only difference is, that we know better than
   our ancestors, how to apply them. In like manner, since the days of the
   apostolate no new remedy for the healing of souls has been created or
   invented. Indeed, some of the powers then at work are lost to us, e.g.,
   the, charisma of tongues. All the difference between the Church then
   and now is, that we, according to this thinking and emotional age,
   understand more profoundly the connection between the effect of the
   remedy and the healing of our wounds.

   This difference does not make us richer or poorer. For the simple
   peasant it is sufficient to receive the prescribed medicine, altho he
   is ignorant of its ingredients and effects upon blood and nerves. In
   his world this need does not exist. But the man of thought,
   understanding the connection between cause and effect, has no
   confidence in any medicine unless he knows something of its working. To
   him, this knowledge is a positive need, and to the psychological effect
   it is even indispensable.

   This is likewise true of the Church of Christ; it has not been always
   the same, neither have its needs. The development of our knowledge has
   been such that every age has received an insight adapted to satisfy its
   necessity. More than this: the very fermentation of the age has created
   the modified need, and has been used of God to give a clearer
   understanding of the truth.

   And yet, whatever the increased clearness and maturity of the knowledge
   concerning the secret of the Lord during the ages, the secret itself
   has remained the same. Nothing has been added to it. And the mystery of
   the apostolate is, that by the labors of its members the whole secret
   of the Lord was made known to the Church, under the infallible
   authorship of the divine Inspirer, the Holy Spirit.

   This is the great fact accomplished by the apostolate: the publication
   of the whole secret of the Lord, by which the revelation in the Old
   Testament, to John the Baptist and Christ was enlarged and worked out.
   For to complete a thing means to add that which before was lacking;
   after which nothing more can be added. And this is the second point
   that we emphasize.

   Through the apostles the Church received something not possessed by
   Israel nor imparted by Christ. Christ Himself declares: "I have yet
   many things to say unto you, but ye can not bear them now. Howbeit when
   He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth; for
   He shall not speak from Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that
   shall He speak; and He will shew you things to come. He shall glorify
   Me; for He shall receive of Mine, and shall shew it unto you" (John
   xvi. 12-14). St. Paul spoke not less clearly, saying: "That the mystery
   which was kept secret since the world began was now made manifest"
   (Rom. xvi. 25). And again: "To make men see what is the dispensation of
   the mystery which from all ages was hid in God." And again: "The
   mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is
   made manifest to his saints" (Col. i. 16). Finally, St. John declares
   that the apostles testify of what they had looked upon with their eyes,
   and their hands had handled of the Word of Life, which was with the
   Father, and which is manifested.

   Altho we do not deny that the germ of saving knowledge was given in
   Paradise, to the Patriarchs, and to Israel; yet the Scripture teaches
   distinctly that truth was revealed to the Patriarchs, unknown in
   Paradise; to Israel, of which the Patriarchs were ignorant; and by
   Jesus, truth that was hidden from Israel. In like manner, truth not
   declared by Jesus was revealed to the Church by the holy apostolate.

   Against this last statement, however, objections are raised: Many
   unbelieving writers of the present century have frequently asserted
   that not Jesus, but Paul was the real founder of Christianity; while
   others have frequently exhorted us to abandon the orthodox theology of
   St. Paul, and to return to the simple teachings of Jesus; especially to
   His Sermon on the Mount.

   And really, the more the Scripture is studied the more obvious the
   difference between the Sermon on the Mount and the Epistle to the
   Romans will appear. Not as tho the two contradict each other, but in
   this way, that the latter contains elements of truth, new rays of
   light, not found in the former.

   If one objects to the doctrines of the apostles, as does the Groninger
   School, it is natural to place the gospels above the epistles. Hence
   the fact that many half-believers still receive the Parables and the
   Sermon on the Mount, but reject the doctrine of justification, as
   taught by St. Paul; while those who wish to break with Christianity
   entirely are inclined to consider the Pauline epistles as its real
   exponent, but only to reject them with the entire Pauline Christianity.
   For the Church of the living God, which receives both, there is in this
   unholy tendency an exhortation to have an open eye for the difference
   between the gospels and the epistles, and to acknowledge that our
   opponents are right when they call it a marked difference.

   Yet while our opponents use the difference to attack either the
   authority of the apostolic doctrine or that of Christendom itself, the
   Church confesses that there is nothing surprising in this difference.
   Both are parts of the same doctrine of Jesus, with this distinction,
   that the first part was revealed directly by Christ, while the other He
   gave to His Church indirectly by the apostles.

   Of course, so long as the apostles are considered as independent
   persons, teaching a new doctrine on their own authority, our solution
   does not solve the difficulty. But confessing that they are holy
   apostles, i.e., organs of the Holy Spirit through whom Jesus Himself
   taught His people from heaven, then every objection is met, and there
   is not even a shadow of conflict.

   For Jesus simply acted like an earthly father in the training of his
   children, who teaches them according to their, comprehension; and in
   case of his death, his task still unfinished, he will leave them
   written instructions to be opened after his departure. But Jesus died
   to rise again, and even after His Ascension He continued to be in
   living contact with His Church through the apostolate. And what we
   would write before our decease, Jesus caused to be written by His
   apostles under the special direction of the Holy Spirit. Thus the
   Scriptures of the New Testament originate--a New Testament in a sense
   now easily understood.

   The correctness of this representation is proven by Christ's own words,
   which teach us--

   First, that there were things declared to the apostles before His
   departure, and there were things not declared, because they could not
   bear them then.

   Secondly, that Jesus would declare the latter, also, but by the Holy
   Spirit.

   Thirdly, that the Holy Spirit would reveal these things to them, not
   apart from Jesus, but by taking them from Christ and declaring them
   unto them.

  The Need of the New Testament Scripture.

   "For I testify onto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of
   this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto
   him the plagues that are written in this book."--Rev. xxii. 18.

   If the Church after the Ascension of Christ had been destined to live
   only one lifetime, and had been confined only to the land of the Jews,
   the holy apostles could have accomplished their task by verbal
   teaching. But since it was to live at least for eighteen centuries, and
   to be extended over the whole world, the apostles were compelled to
   resort to the written communication of the revelation which they had
   received.

   If they had not written, the churches of Africa and Gaul could never
   have received trustworthy information; and the tradition would have
   lost its reliable character ages ago. The written revelation has,
   therefore, been the indispensable means whereby the Church, during its
   long and ever-extending career, has been preserved from complete
   degeneration and falsification.

   However, from their epistles it does not appear that the apostles
   clearly understood this. Surely, that the Church would sojourn in this
   world for eighteen centuries, they did not expect; and almost all their
   epistles bear a local character, as tho not intended for the Church in
   general, but only for particular churches. And yet, altho they
   understood it not, the Lord Jesus knew it; He had thus planned it;
   hence the epistle written exclusively for the church of Rome was
   intended and ordained by Him, and without Paul's knowledge, to edify
   the Church of all ages.

   Hence two things had to be done for the Church of the future:

   First, the image of Christ must be received from the lips of the
   apostles and be committed to writing.

   Secondly, the things of which Jesus had said, "Ye can not bear them
   now, but the Holy Spirit will declare them unto you," must be recorded.
   This is the postulate of the whole matter. The condition of the
   churches, their long duration in the future, and their world-wide
   extension demanded it.

   And the facts show that the provision was made; but not immediately. So
   long as the Church was confined to a small circle, and the remembrance
   of Christ remained fresh and powerful, the apostles' spoken word was
   sufficient. The decree of the Synod of Jerusalem was probably the first
   written document that proceeded from them. But when the churches began
   to extend across the sea to Corinth and Rome, and northward to Ephesus
   and Galatia, then Paul began to substitute written for verbal
   instructions. Gradually this epistolary labor was extended and Paul's
   example followed. Perhaps each wrote in turn. And to these epistles
   were added the narratives of the life, death, and Resurrection of
   Christ and the Acts of the Apostles. At last the King commanded John
   from heaven to write in a book the extraordinary revelation given him
   on Patmos.

   The result was a gradually increasing number of apostolic and
   non-apostolic writings, probably far exceeding that contained in the
   New Testament. At least Paul's epistles show that he wrote many more
   than we now possess. But even if he had not thus informed us, the fact
   would have been sufficiently well established; for it is improbable
   that such excellent writers as Paul and John should not have written
   more than a dozen letters during their long and eventful lives. Even in
   one year they must have written more than that. The controversy of
   former days over the assertion that no apostolic writings could have
   been lost was most foolish, and showed little reckoning with real life.

   It is remarkable that from this great mass a small number of writings
   was gradually separated. A few were collected first, then more were
   added, and arranged in certain order. It took a long time before there
   was uniformity and agreement; indeed, some writings were not
   universally recognized until after three centuries. But in spite of
   time and controversy, the sifting took place, and the result was, that
   the Church distinguished in this great mass of literature two distinct
   parts: on the one hand, this arranged set of twenty-seven books; and on
   the other, the remaining writings of early origin.

   And when the process of sifting and separating was ended, and the Holy
   Spirit had borne witness, in the churches that this set of writings
   constituted a whole, and was, indeed, the Testament of the Lord Jesus
   to His Church, then the Church became conscious that it possessed a
   second collection of sacred books of equal authority with the first
   collection given to Israel; then it put the Old and the New Testament
   together, which unitedly form the Holy Scripture, our Bible, the Word
   of God.

   To the question, How did the New Testament Scripture originate? we
   answer without hesitation, By the Holy Spirit.

   How? Did He say to Paul or John: "Sit down and write"?

   The gospels and the epistles do not so impress us. It does indeed apply
   to the Revelation of St. John, but not to the other New Testament
   Scriptures. They rather impress us as being written without the
   slightest idea of being intended for the Church of all ages. Their
   authors impress us as writing to certain churches of their own definite
   time, and that after a hundred years perhaps not a single fragment of
   their writings would be in existence. They were indeed conscious of the
   Holy Spirit's aid in writing the truth even as they enjoyed it in
   speaking; but that they were writing parts of the Holy Scripture, they
   surely knew not.

   When St. Paul had finished his Epistle to the Romans, it never occurred
   to him that in future ages his letter would possess for millions of
   God's children an authority equal to, or even higher than that of the
   prophecies of Isaiah and the Psalms of David. Nor could the first
   readers of his epistle, in the church of Rome, have imagined that after
   eighteen centuries the names of their principal men would still be
   household words in all parts of the Christian world.

   But if St. Paul knew it not, surely the Holy Spirit did. As by
   education the Lord frequently prepares a maiden for her still unknown,
   future husband, so did the Holy Spirit prepare Paul, John, and Peter
   for their work. He directed their lives, circumstances, and conditions;
   He caused such thoughts, meditations, and even words to arise in their
   hearts as the writing of the New Testament Scripture required. And
   while they were writing these portions of the Holy Scripture, that one
   day would be the treasure of the universal Church in all ages, a fact
   not understood by them, but by the Holy Spirit, He so directed their
   thoughts as to guard them against mistakes and lead them into all
   truth. He foreknew what the complete New Testament Scripture ought to
   be, and what parts would belong to it. As an architect, by his
   mechanics, prepares the various parts of the building, afterward to fit
   them in their places, so did the Holy Spirit by different workers
   prepare the different parts of the New Testament, which afterward He
   united in a whole.

   For the Lord, who by His Holy Spirit caused the preparation of these
   parts, is also King of the Church; He saw these parts scattered abroad;
   He led men to care for them, and believers to have faith in them. And,
   finally, by means of the men interested, He united these loose
   fragments, so that gradually, according to His royal decree, the New
   Testament originated.

   Hence it was not necessary that the New Testament Scripture should
   contain only apostolic writings. Mark and Luke were no apostles; and
   the notion that these men must have written under the direction of Paul
   or. Peter has no proof nor force. What is the benefit of writing under
   the direction of an apostle? That which gives divine authority to the
   writings of Luke is not the influence of an apostle, but that he wrote
   under the absolute inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

   Believing in the authority of the New Testament, we must acknowledge
   the authority of the four evangelists to be perfectly equal. As to the
   contents, Matthew's gospel may surpass that of Luke, and John's may
   excel the gospel of Mark; but their authority is equally
   unquestionable. The Epistle to the Romans has higher value than that to
   Philemon; but their authority is the same. As to their persons, John
   stood above Mark, and Paul above Jude; but since we depend not upon the
   authority of their persons, but only upon that of the Holy Spirit,
   these personal differences are of no account.

   Hence the question is not whether the New Testament writers were
   apostles, but whether they were inspired by the Holy Spirit.

   Assuredly, it has pleased the King to connect His testimony with the
   apostolate; for He said: "Ye are My witnesses." Hence we know that Luke
   and Mark obtained their information concerning Christ from the
   apostles; but our guaranty for the accuracy and reliability of their
   statements is not the apostolic origin of the same, but the authority
   of the Holy Spirit. Hence the apostles are the channels through which
   the knowledge of these things flows to us from Christ; but whether this
   knowledge reaches us through their writings or through those of others
   makes no difference. The vital question is, whether the bearers of the
   apostolic tradition were infallibly inspired or not.

   Even tho a writing were indorsed by the twelve apostles, this would not
   be positive proof of its credibility or divine authority. For altho
   they had the promise that the Holy Spirit would lead them into all
   truth, this does not exclude the possibility of their falling into
   mistakes or even untruths. The promise did not imply absolute
   infallibility, at all times, but merely when they should act as the
   witnesses of Jesus. Hence the information that a document comes from
   the hand of an apostle is insufficient. It requires the additional
   information that it belongs to the things which the apostle wrote as a
   witness of Jesus.

   If, therefore, the divine authority of any writing does not depend upon
   its apostolic character, but solely upon the authority of the Holy
   Spirit, it follows, as a matter of course, that the Holy Spirit is
   entirely free to have the apostolic testimony recorded by the apostles
   themselves, or by any one else; in both cases the authority of these
   writings is exactly the same. Personal preferences are out of the
   question. So far as form, content, wealth, and attractiveness are
   concerned, we may distinguish between John and Mark, Paul and Jude. But
   when it touches the question of the divine authority before which we
   must bow, then, we no longer take account of any such distinctions, and
   we ask only: Is this or that gospel inspired by the Holy Spirit?
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXXV.

  The Character of the New Testament Scripture.

   "And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."--1
   John i. 4.

   From the two preceding articles it is evident that the New Testament
   Scripture was not intended to bear the character of a notarial
   document. If this had been the Lord's intention we should have received
   something entirely different. It would have required a twofold legal
   evidence:

   In the first place, the proof that the events narrated in the New
   Testament actually occurred as related.

   Secondly, that the revelations received by the apostles are correctly
   communicated.

   Both certifications should be furnished by witnesses, e.g., to prove
   the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand would require:

   1. A declaration of a number of persons, stating that they were
   eye-witnesses of the miracle.

   2. An authentic declaration of the magistrates of the surrounding
   places certifying to their signatures.

   3. A declaration of competent persons to prove that these witnesses
   were known as honest and trustworthy people, disinterested and
   competent to judge. Moreover, it would be necessary by proper testimony
   to prove that, among the five thousand, there were only seven loaves
   and two fishes.

   4. That the increase of bread took place while Jesus broke it.

   In the presence of a number of such documents, each duly authenticated
   and sealed, persons not too skeptical might find it possible to believe
   that the event had occurred as narrated in the Gospel.

   To prove this one miracle would require a number of documents as
   voluminous as the whole of St. Matthew. If it were possible thus to
   prove all the events recorded in the gospels and the Acts of the
   Apostles, then the credibility of these narratives would be properly
   established.

   And even this would be far from satisfactory. For the difficulty would
   remain to prove that the epistles contain correct communications of the
   revelations received by the apostles. Such proof would be impossible.
   It would require eye- and ear-witnesses to these revelations; and a
   number of stenographers to report them. If this had been possible,
   then, we concede, there would have been, if not mathematical certainty
   for every expression, yet sufficient ground for accepting the general
   tenor of the epistles.

   But when the apostles wrote them there was no audible voice. And when a
   voice was heard, it could not be understood, as in the base of Paul's
   revelation on the way to Damascus. The same may be said of what
   occurred on Patmos: St. John actually heard a voice, but the hearing
   and the understanding of the words which it uttered required a
   peculiar, spiritual operation that was lacking in the people at the
   same time on the island.

   The fact is, that the revelation of the Holy Spirit granted to the
   apostles was of such a nature that it could not be perceived by others.
   Hence the impossibility to prove its genuineness by notarial evidence.
   He that insists upon it ought to know that the Church can not furnish
   it, either for the historical narratives of the gospels, or for the
   spiritual contents of the epistles.

   Hence it is evident that every effort to prove the truth of the
   contents of the New Testament by external evidence only condemns
   itself, and must result in the absolute rejection of the authority of
   the Holy Scripture. If a judge of the present day should condemn or
   acquit an accused person on the ground of the insignificant evidence
   which satisfies many honest people with reference to the Scripture,
   what a storm of indignation would it raise! The whole list of the
   so-called evidences as to the credibility of the New Testament writers,
   that they were competent to judge, willing to testify, disinterested,
   etc., proves nothing indeed.

   Such externals may suffice when it concerns ordinary events, of which
   one might say: "I believe that it has really happened; I have no reason
   to doubt it; but if to-morrow it should prove not to be so, I will lose
   nothing by it." But how can such superficial methods be applied when it
   concerns the extraordinary events related by the Holy Scripture, upon
   the positive certainty of which my own and my children's highest
   interests depend; so that, if they proved to be untrue, e.g., the
   report of the resurrection of Christ, we should suffer the priceless
   and irreparable loss of an eternal salvation?

   This can not be; it is absolutely unthinkable. And experience proves
   that the efforts of foolish people to prop their faith by such proofs
   has always ended with the loss of all faith. Nay, such kind of proof is
   by its very insignificance either unworthy to be mentioned with
   reference to such serious matters, or, if it be worth anything, it can
   not be furnished, nor ought it to be.

   Notarial or mathematical proof neither can nor may be furnished,
   because the character and nature of the contents of Scripture are
   inconsistent with or repellent to such demonstration.

   No man may demand legal proofs for the fact that the man whom he loves
   and honors as father is his father indeed; God has made such proof
   impossible by the very nature of the case. The delicacy which ennobles
   all family life cuts off the very appearance of such investigation;
   and, if it were possible, the son, furnished with such proof, would
   ipso facto have lost his father and mother; they would be his parents
   no more; and beneath the pile of evidence his child-life would be
   buried.

   The same principle applies to the Holy Scripture. The nature and
   character of the revelation has been so ordered that it allows no
   notarial demonstration. The revelation to the apostles is unthinkable,
   if other persons could have heard, recorded, and published it as well
   as they. It was an operation of holy energies; not intended to compel
   doubters to a mere outward faith, but simply to accomplish that for
   which God had sent it, without caring much for the contradiction of the
   skeptics. It concerns a work of God which legal or mathematical
   investigation can not fathom; which manifests itself upon the spiritual
   domain where certainty obtains not by outward demonstration, but by
   personal faith of the one in the other.

   As faith in father and mother springs not from mathematical
   demonstration, but from the contact of love, the fellowship of life,
   and personal trust in each other, even so here. A life of love unfolded
   itself. The mercies of God came bending down to us in tender
   compassion. And every man touched by this divine life was affected by
   its influence, taken up by it, lived in it, felt himself in sympathetic
   fellowship with it; and, in a way imperceptible and not understood,
   obtained a certainty, far above any other, that he was in the presence
   of facts, and that they were divinely revealed.

   And such is the origin of faith; not supported by scientific proof, for
   then it would be no faith; which has mastered the reader of the Holy
   Scripture in an entirely different way. The existence of the Scripture
   is owing to an act of the unfathomable mercies of God; and for this
   reason man's acceptance must equally be an act of absolute self-denial
   and gratitude. It is only the broken and contrite heart, filled with
   thankfulness to God for His excellent mercy, that can cast itself into
   the Scripture as into its life-element, and feel that here is found
   real assurance, casting out all doubt.

   Hence we must distinguish a threefold operation of the Holy Spirit with
   reference to faith in the New Testament Scripture:

   First, a divine working giving a revelation to the apostles.

   Second, a working called inspiration.

   Third, a working, active to-day, creating faith in the Scripture in the
   heart at first unwilling to believe.

   First comes revelation proper.

   E g., when St. Paul wrote his treatise on the resurrection (1 Cor.
   xv.), he did not develop that truth for the first time. Probably he had
   apprehended it previously, and in his sermons and private
   correspondence expounded it. Hence the revelation antedates the
   epistle. It belonged to the things of which Jesus had said: "When the
   Holy Spirit has come He shall guide you into all truth, and He will
   show you things to come." (John xvi. 13) And he received that
   revelation in such a way that he had the positive conviction that thus
   the Holy Spirit had revealed it to him, and that thus he would see it
   in the Judgment day.

   But the epistle was not yet written. This required a second act of the
   Holy Spirit--that of inspiration.

   Without this the knowledge that St. Paul had received a revelation
   would be useless. What warrant should we have that he had correctly
   understood and faithfully recorded it? He might have made a mistake in
   the communication, adding to it or taking from it, thus making it an
   unreliable report. Hence inspiration was indispensable; for by it the
   apostle was kept from error while he recorded the revelation previously
   received.

   Lastly, the spiritual bond must be created connecting the soul and the
   consciousness with the spiritual realities of the infallible Word of
   God--positive conviction of spiritual things.

   The Holy Spirit accomplishes this by the implanting of faith, with the
   various preparations that ordinarily precede the breaking forth of the
   act of believing. The result is inward conviction. This is not wrought
   by referring us to Josephus or Tacitus, but in a spiritual way. The
   content of the Scripture is brought to the soul. The conflict between
   the Word and the soul is felt. The conviction thus wrought causes us to
   see not that the Scripture must make room for us, but we for the
   Scripture.

   In the discussion of regeneration we shall refer to this point more
   largely. For the present we shall be satisfied if we have succeeded in
   showing that the existence of the New Testament Scripture and our faith
   in it are not the work of man, but a work in which the Holy Spirit
   alone must be honored.

THE CHURCH OF CHRIST.

  XXXVI.

  The Church of Christ.

   "It is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is ruth."--1
   John v. 6.

   We now proceed to discuss the work of the Holy Spirit wrought in the
   Church of Christ.

   Altho the Son of God has had a Church in the earth from the beginning,
   yet the Scripture distinguishes between its manifestation before and
   after Christ. As the acorn, planted in the ground, exists, altho it
   passes through the two periods of germinating and rooting, and of
   growing upward and forming trunk and branches, even so the Church. At
   first hidden in the soil of Israel, wrapped in the swaddling-clothes of
   its national existence, it was only on the day of Pentecost that it was
   manifested in the world.

   Not that the Church was founded only on Pentecost; this would be a
   denial of the Old Covenant revelation, a falsification of the idea of
   Church, and an annihilation of God's election. We only say that on that
   day it became the Church for the world.

   And in it the Holy Spirit has wrought a very comprehensive work.

   Not its formation, however, for that is the work of the Triune God in
   the divine decree; or, speaking more definitely, of Jesus the King when
   He bought His people with His own blood.

   Indeed, the Spirit of God regenerates the elect, whom He does not find
   in the world, but already in the Church. Every representation as tho
   the Holy Spirit gathers the elect out of a lost world, and so brings
   them into the Church, opposes the Scripture's representation of the
   Church as an organism. Christ's Church is a body, and as the members
   grow out of the body and are not added to it from without, so must the
   seed of the Church be looked for in the Church and not in the world.
   The Holy Spirit works that only which is already sanctified in Christ.
   Hence our form of Baptism reads: "Do you acknowledge that altho our
   children are conceived and born in sin, and therefore are subject to
   all miseries, yea to condemnation itself; yet that they are sanctified
   in Christ?"

   However, since regeneration belongs to His work in the individual, and
   we are considering now His work in the Church as a whole, as a
   community, we direct our attention, in the first place, to His work of
   imparting spiritual gifts, particularly those called "charismata." Some
   New Testament passages speak of gifts like those offered to God (Matt.
   v. 23): "If thou bring thy gift to the altar"; or gifts communicated to
   others (2 Cor. viii. 9 and Phil. iv. 17) and the gift of salvation; but
   those we do not consider.

   A gift offered to God is called in the Greek "doron"; imparted, to
   others, it is commonly called "charis"; while the gift of grace is
   usually called "dorea." Hence these gifts are distinct from those that
   now occupy our attention. And this distinction appears strongest when
   we compare the gift of the Holy Spirit with spiritual gifts. The Holy
   Spirit Himself is a gift of grace. But when He imparts spiritual gifts
   He adorns us with holy ornaments. The first refers to our salvation;
   the last to our talents.

   Referring to our salvation, the Scripture calls it a free and gracious
   gift, generally "dorea" in the Greek, which, being derived from a root
   meaning to give, denotes that we were not entitled to it, having
   neither merited nor bought it, but that it is a given good. St. Paul
   exclaims: "Thanks unto God for His unspeakable gift," i.e., of
   salvation (2 Cor. ix. 15). And again: "Much more the grace of God and
   the gift of grace, which is by one man Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto
   many." "Much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of
   righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ." (Rom. v. 15,
   17). And lastly: "But unto every one of us is given grace according to
   the measure of the gift of Christ." (Ephes. iv. 7). [17]

   The same expression is used invariably for the imparting of the Holy
   Spirit: "Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts ii. 38).
   And: "Because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the
   Holy Ghost" (Acts x. 45). Hence it should be carefully noticed that
   this has nothing to do with the subject under consideration. When St.
   Paul speaks of faith as the gift of God, he refers to our salvation and
   God's saving work in the soul. But the gifts of which we now speak are
   wholly different. They are not unto salvation, but to the glory of God.
   They are lent to us as ornaments, that we should show their beauty as
   talents to gain other talents therewith. They are additional operations
   of grace; which can not take the place of the proper work of the grace
   of salvation, nor confirm it, having an entirely different purpose. The
   work of grace is for our own salvation, joy, and upbuilding; the
   charismata are given us for others. The first implies that we have
   received the Holy Spirit; the latter that He imparts gifts unto us.

   Properly speaking, the charismata are given to the churches, not to
   individual persons. When a ruler selects and trains men for officers in
   the army, it is evident that he does this not for their personal
   enjoyment, honor, and aggrandizement, but for the efficiency and honor
   of the army. He can search for men with talents for the military
   service, and train and instruct them; but he can not create such
   talents. If this were possible, every king would endow his generals
   with the genius of a Von Moltke, and every admiral would be a De
   Ruyter.

   But Jesus is not thus limited. He is independent; unto Him all power is
   given in heaven and on earth. He can create talents, and freely impart
   them to whomsoever He will. Hence, knowing what the Church requires for
   its protection and upbuilding, He can fully supply all its need. His
   purpose is not merely to please or enrich individuals, much less to
   give to some what He withholds from others; but with the persons thus
   endowed to adorn and favor the whole Church. We do not put a lamp upon
   the table to show it a special favor or because it is more excellent
   than chair or stove; but simply because thus it serves its purpose, and
   the whole room is lighted. To consider the charismata as intended
   merely to adorn and benefit the person endowed would be just as absurd
   as to say: "I light the fire to warm not the room, but the stove"; and
   to be jealous of the charismata given to others in the Church would be
   just as foolish as for the table to be jealous of the stove because it
   gets all the fire.

   The charismata must therefore be considered in an economical sense. The
   Church is a large household with many wants; an institution to be made
   efficient by the means of many things. They are to the Church what
   light and fuel are to the household; not existing for themselves, but
   for the family, and to be laid aside when the days are long and warm.
   This applies directly to the charismata, many of which, given to the
   apostolic Church, are not of service to the Church of the present day.

   These charismata have undoubtedly more or less an official character.
   God has instituted offices in the Church; not in a mechanical way, or
   depending upon robe or gown; such unspiritual conception is foreign to
   the Scripture. But as there is division of labor in the army or in the
   human body, so there is in the Church.

   Take, e.g., the body. It must be protected against injury; blood must
   be carried to muscles and nerves; venous blood must be converted into
   arterial; the lungs must inhale fresh air, etc. All these activities
   are laid upon the various members of the body. Eye and ear keep watch;
   the heart propels the blood; the lungs supply the oxygen, etc. And this
   can not be changed arbitrarily. The lungs can not watch; the eye can
   not supply oxygen; the skin can not propel the blood. Hence this
   division of labor is neither arbitrary, by mutual consent, nor, a
   matter of pleasure; but it is divinely ordained, and this ordinance
   must not be ignored. Hence the eye has the office and gift of watching
   over the body; the heart of circulating the blood; the lungs of
   supplying fresh air; etc.

   And this applies to the Church in every respect. That great body
   requires the doing of many and various things for the common weal.
   There is need of guidance, of prophesying, of heroism; mercy must be
   exercised, the sick must be healed, etc. And this great mutual task the
   Lord has divided among many members. He has given to His body, the
   Church, eyes, ears, hands, and feet; and each of these organic members
   a peculiar task, calling, and office.

   Hence to be called to an office simply means to be charged by Jesus,
   the King, with a definite task. You have done some work. Very well, but
   how? From impulse, or in obedience to the charge of your Sender? This
   makes all the difference. The King may send us in the ordinary or in an
   extraordinary way. Zacharias was a priest of the course of Abijah; but
   his son John was the herald of Christ by extraordinary revelation. The
   Levite served by right of succession; the prophet because he was chosen
   of God. But this makes no difference; called in the one way or the
   other, the office remains the same, so long as we have the assurance
   that King Jesus has called and ordained us.

   For this reason our fathers devoutly spoke of an office of all
   believers. In Christ's Church there are not merely a few officials and
   a mass of idle, unworthy subjects, but every believer has a calling, a
   task, a vital charge. And inasmuch as we are convinced that we perform
   the task because the King has laid it upon us not for ourselves, nor
   even from the motive of philanthropy, but to serve the Church, to this
   extent has our work an official character, altho the world denies us
   the honor.

   [17] It should be noticed that in Rom. v. 15, 16; vi. 23; xi. 29, the
   word "charisma" is found in the Greek text, referring to salvation. The
   reason is that these passages refer not to the graciousness of the
   gift, but to its scintillating brightness, in contrast with corruption
   and death. "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal
   life."

  Spiritual Gifts.

   "But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And a still more excellent way
   show I unto you." --1 Cor. xii. 31 (R.V.).

   The charismata or spiritual gifts are the divinely ordained means and
   powers whereby the King enables His Church to perform its task on the
   earth.

   The Church has a calling in the world. It is being violently attacked
   not only by the powers of this world, but much more by the invisible
   powers of Satan. No rest is allowed. Denying that Christ has conquered,
   Satan believes that the time left him may yet bring him victories.
   Hence his restless rage and fury, his incessant attacks upon the
   ordinances of the Church, his constant endeavor to divide and corrupt
   it, and his ever-repeated denial of the authority and kingship of Jesus
   in His Church. Altho he will never succeed entirely, he does succeed to
   some extent. The history of the Church in every country shows it; it
   proves that a satisfactory condition of the Church is highly
   exceptional and of short duration, and that for eight out of ten
   centuries its state is sad and deplorable, cause for shame and grief on
   the part of God's people.

   And yet in all this warfare it has a calling to fulfill, an appointed
   task to accomplish. It may sometimes consist in being sifted like
   wheat, as in Job's case, to show that by virtue of Christ's prayer
   faith cannot be destroyed in its bosom. But whatever the form of the
   task, the Church always needs spiritual power to perform it; a power
   not in itself, but which the King must supply.

   Every means afforded by the King for the doing of His work is a
   charisma, a gift of grace. Hence the internal connection between work,
   office, and gift.

   Wherefore St. Paul says: "To each one is given the manifestation of the
   Spirit to profit withal," (1 Cor. xii. 7) i.e., for the general good
   (Ã°Ã±Ã¯Ã² ro avpotpov) (1 Cor. xii. 7). And, again, still more clearly:
   "Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that
   ye may excel, to the edifying of the Church" (1 Cor. xiv. 12). Hence
   the petition, "Thy Kingdom come," which the Heidelberg Catechism
   interprets: "Rule us so by Thy Word and Spirit that we may submit
   ourselves more and more to Thee; preserve and increase Thy Church;
   destroy the works of the devil, and all violence which would exalt
   itself against Thee, and also all wicked counsels devised against Thy
   Holy Word, till the full perfection of the Kingdom takes place, wherein
   Thou shall be all in all."

   It is wrong, therefore, to consider the life of individual believers
   too much by itself, separating it from the life of the Church. They
   exist not but in connection with the body, and thus they become
   partakers of the spiritual gifts. In this sense the Heidelberg
   Catechism confesses the communion of saints: "First, that all and every
   one who believes, being members of Christ, are in common partakers of
   Him and of all His riches and gifts; secondly, that every one must know
   it to be his duty readily and cheerfully to employ his gifts for the
   advantage and salvation of other members." The parable of the talents
   has the same aim; for the servant who with his talent failed to benefit
   others receives a terrible judgment. Even the hidden gift must be
   stirred up, as St. Paul says; not to boast of it or to feed our pride,
   but because it is the Lord's and intended for the Church.

   St. John writing, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know
   all things" (1 John ii. 20), and "Ye need not that any man teach you"
   (1 John ii. 27), does not mean to say that every individual believer
   possesses the full anointing, and in virtue of this knoweth all things.
   For if this were so, who would not despair of salvation, nor dare say:
   "I have, the faith"? Moreover, how could the statement, "Ye need not
   that any man teach you," be reconciled with the testimony of the same
   apostle, that the Holy Spirit qualifies teachers appointed by Jesus
   Himself? Not the individual believer, but the whole Church as a body
   possesses the full anointing of the Holy One and knows all things. The
   Church as a body needs not that any come to teach it from without; for
   it, possesses all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, being united
   with the Head, who is the reflection of the glory of God, in whom
   dwelleth all wisdom.

   And this applies not to the Church of one period, but of all ages. The
   Church of to-day is the same as in the, day of the apostles. The life
   lived then is the life that animates it now. The gains of two centuries
   ago belong to its treasury, as well as those received to-day. The past
   is its capital. The wonderful and glorious revelation received by the
   Church of the first century was given, through it, to the Church of all
   ages, and is still effectual. And all the spiritual strength and
   insight, the inward grace, the clearer consciousness, received during
   the course of the ages are not lost, but form an accumulated treasure,
   increasing still by the ever-renewed additions of spiritual gifts.

   He who realizes and acknowledges this fact feels himself rich, and
   blessed indeed. For this apostolic view of the matter causes us to be
   thankful for our brother's gift, which otherwise we might envy;
   inasmuch as those gifts do not impoverish, but enrich us. In one city
   there may be twelve ministers of the Word, all gifted in various
   directions. According to the natural man, each will be jealous of his
   brother's gifts and fear that his talents will excel his own. But not
   so among the Lord's own servants. They feel that together they serve
   one Lord and one flock, and bless God for giving them together what the
   leading and feeding require. In an army the artillerist is not jealous
   of the cavalryman, for he knows that the latter is for his protection
   in the hour of danger.

   Moreover, this apostolic standpoint excludes isolation; for it creates
   the longing for fellowship with distant brethren, even tho they walk in
   more or less deviating paths. It is impossible, Bible in hand, to limit
   Christ's Church to one's own little community. It is everywhere, in all
   parts of the world; and whatever its external form, frequently
   changing, often impure, yet the gifts wherever received increase our
   riches.

   This apostolic standpoint is also against the foolish notion that for
   eighteen centuries the Church has received no gifts whatever; and hence
   that, like the early Church, each of us must take his Bible to
   formulate his own confession. That standpoint makes one so intensely
   conscious of the communion of spiritual gifts that he can not but
   appreciate the Church's treasure accumulated during the centuries. In
   fact, Christ's Church has received greatest abundance of spiritual
   gifts; and to-day we have the disposition not only of the gifts of the
   churches in our own city, but of all those imparted to the churches
   elsewhere, and of the historic capital accumulated during eighteen
   centuries.

   Hence the treasure of every particular church is threefold: First, the
   charismata in its own circle; secondly, those given to other churches;
   and lastly, those received since the days of the apostles.

   According to their nature these spiritual gifts may be divided into
   three classes: the official, the extraordinary, and the ordinary.

   St. Paul says: "To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom,
   and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit, and
   to another faith by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in
   the one Spirit; and to another workings of miracles, and to another
   prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to another divers
   kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues. But all
   these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one
   severally even as He will" (1 Cor. xviii. 8-11). In like manner the
   apostle speaks to the Church of Rome: "Having then gifts differing
   according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us
   prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait
   on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that
   exhorteth, on exhortation; he that giveth let him do it with
   simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with
   cheerfulness" (Rom. xii. 6-8).

   From these passages it is evident that among these charismata St. Paul
   assigns the first place to the gifts pertaining to the ordinary service
   of the Church by its ministers, elders, and deacons. For by prophecy
   St. Paul designates animated preaching, wherein the preacher feels
   himself cheered and inspired by the Holy Spirit. By "teaching" he means
   ordinary catechizing. "Ministry" refers to the management of the
   temporalities of the Church. "Giving" has reference to the care for the
   poor and the miserable. "He that ruleth" refers to the officers in
   charge of the government of the Church. These are the ordinary offices
   embracing the care of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the Church.

   Then follows a different series of charismata, viz., tongues, healing,
   discernment of spirits, etc. These non-official gifts divide themselves
   into two classes--those that strengthen the gifts of saving grace, and
   those distinct from the grace of salvation.

   The former are, e.g., faith and love. Without faith no one can be
   saved. It is therefore the portion of all God's children, and as such
   not a "charisma," but a "doron."But while all have faith, God is free
   to let it manifest itself more strongly in the one than in another. Of
   one degree Scripture says: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
   shaft be saved" (Acts xvi. 31); and of another: "If ye have faith as a
   grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to
   yonder place, and it shall remove." (Matt. xvii. 20) The first works
   internally, the other externally. For this reason St. Paul speaks not
   only of ministries and gifts, but also of  "workings," which consist in
   a more vigorous exercise of the grace which the believer as such
   possesses already. Where the faith of many languishes, the Lord
   frequently grants extraordinary workings of faith to some, thus to
   refresh and comfort others. The same is true of love, which also is the
   portion of all, but not in the same effectual degree. And where the
   love of many waxes cold, the Lord sometimes quickens it in the few to
   such extent that others see it and are provoked to holy jealousy.

   Besides these ordinary charismata, which are only more energetic
   manifestations of what every believer possesses in the germ, the Lord
   has also given to His church extraordinary gifts, working partly upon
   the spiritual and partly upon the physical domain. Of the latter are
   the charismata of self-restraint and healing of the sick. Of the former
   Christ speaks in Matt. xix. 12, where he calls such persons "eunuchs
   for the sake of the Kingdom." St. Paul says that for the sake of the
   weak brother he will abstain from meat; and again, that he keeps under
   the body, bringing it into subjection, etc. The charisma of healing
   refers to the glorious gift of healing the sick: not only those who
   suffer from nervous diseases and psychological ailments, who are more
   susceptible to spiritual influences, but also those whose diseases are
   wholly outside the spiritual realm.

   Of an entirely different nature are the extraordinary, purely spiritual
   charismata, of which St. Paul mentions five: wisdom, knowledge,
   discernment of spirits, tongues and their interpretation. These may
   also be divided in two classes, inasmuch as the first three mentioned
   are also found, altho in a different form, outside of the Kingdom of
   God; and the last two, which present a wholly peculiar phenomenon,
   within the Kingdom. Wisdom, knowledge, and discernment of spirits exist
   even among the heathen, and are much admired by those who reject the
   Christ. But those natural gifts appear in the Church in a different
   way. The charisma of wisdom enables one without much investigation,
   with great tact and clearness, to understand conditions and to offer
   judicious advice. Knowledge is a charisma whereby the Holy Spirit
   enables one to acquire an unusually deep insight into the mysteries of
   the Kingdom. Discernment of spirits is a charisma whereby one can
   discern between the genuine spirits raised up of God and those that
   only pretend to be such. The charisma of tongues we have discussed at
   length in the twenty-eighth article.

   The charismata now existing in the Church are those pertaining to the
   ministry of the Word; the ordinary charismata of increased exercise of
   faith and love; those of wisdom, knowledge, and discernment of spirits;
   that of self-restraint; and lastly, that of healing the sick suffering
   from nervous and psychological diseases. The others for the present are
   inactive.

  XXXVIII.

  The Ministry of the Word.

   "He shall lead you into all truth." --John xvi. 13.

   Let us now consider the second activity of the Holy Spirit in the
   Church, which we prefer to designate as His care-taking of the Word. In
   this we distinguish three parts, viz.: the Sealing, the Interpretation,
   and the Application of the Word.

   In the first place, it is the Holy Spirit who seals the Word. This has
   reference to the "testimonium Spiritus Sancti," of which our fathers
   used to speak and by which they understood the operation whereby He
   creates in the hearts of believers the firm and lasting conviction
   concerning the divine and absolute authority of the Word of God.

   The Word is, if we may so express it, a child of the Holy Spirit. He
   has brought it forth. We owe it entirely to His peculiar activity. He
   is its Auctor Primarius, i.e., its Principal Author. And thus it can
   not seem strange that He should exercise that motherly care over the
   child of His own travail whereby He enables it to fulfil its destiny.
   And this destiny is, in the first place, to be believed in by the
   elect; secondly, to be understood by them; and lastly, to be lived by
   them; three operations that are successively effected in them by the
   sealing, the interpretation, and the application of the Word. The
   sealing of the Word quickens the "faith"; the interpretation imparts
   the "right understanding"; and the application effects the "living" of
   it.

   We mention the sealing of the Word first, for without faith in its
   divine authority it can not be God's Word to us.

   The question is: How do we come in real contact and fellowship with the
   Holy Scripture, which, as a mere external object, lies before us?

   We are told that it is the Word of God; but how can this become our own
   firm conviction? It can never be obtained by investigation. In fact, it
   ought to be acknowledged that the more one investigates the Word the
   more he loses his simple and childlike faith in it. It can not even be
   said that the doubt created by superficial inquiry will be dispelled by
   deeper research; for even the profound scrutiny of earnest men has had
   but one result, viz., the increase of interrogation-points.

   We can not in this way examine the contents of the Scripture without
   destroying it for ourselves. If one wishes to examine the contents of
   an egg, he must not break it, for then he disturbs it and it is an egg
   no more; but he should ask them that know about it. In like manner we
   can learn the truth of the Scripture only by sealing and external
   communication.

   For suppose that the final verdict of science will eventually confirm
   the divine authority of the Scripture, as we firmly believe it will,
   what would that avail us in our present spiritual need, since during
   our short life science will not reach that final verdict? And even if
   after thirty or forty years we should see it, would that avail my
   present distress? And if this difficulty could also be removed, we
   would still ask: Is it not cruel to give spiritual assurance only to
   Greek and Hebrew scholars? Do not men see and understand, then, that
   the evidence of the divine authority of the Scripture must come to us
   in such a manner that the simplest old woman in the poorhouse can see
   it just as well as I can?

   Hence all learned investigation, as the basis for spiritual conviction,
   is out of the question. He who denies this maltreats souls and
   introduces an offensive clericalism. For what is the result? The notion
   that the unscholarly can have no assurance of themselves; that is what
   ministers are for; they have studied the matter; they ought to know,
   and the simple folk must believe upon their authority.

   The absurdity of this notion is obvious. In the first place, the
   learned gentlemen are frequently the greatest doubters. Secondly, one
   minister almost always contradicts what another has laid down as the
   truth. And, thirdly, the congregation, treated as a minor, is delivered
   again into the power of men; a yoke is laid upon it which our fathers
   could not bear; and the mistake is made of trying to prove the
   testimony of God by that of men.

   If we must bear a yoke, then give us that of Rome ten times rather than
   that of the scholars; for altho Rome puts men between us and the
   Scripture, they speak at least with one mouth. They all repeat what the
   Pope has settled for them, and his authority rests not upon his
   scholarship, but upon his pretended spiritual illumination. Hence the
   Roman Catholic priests do not contradict one another. Neither is their
   teaching the fancy of a defective learning, but the result of a mental
   development that Rome attained in its most excellent men, and that in
   connection with the spiritual labor of many centuries.

   Of all clericalism, that of the intellectual stamp is the most
   unbearable; for one is always silenced with the remark, "You don't know
   Greek," or, "You don't read Hebrew"; while the child of God feels
   irresistibly that in the matters that concern eternity, Greek and
   Hebrew can not have the last word. And this apart from the fact that to
   a number of these scholars Professor Cobet might say in turn: "Dear
   sir, do you still know Greek yourself?" Of the shallow knowledge of
   Hebrew in the largest number of cases, it is better not to speak.

   No, in that way we never get there. To make the divine authority of the
   Holy Scripture real to us, we need not a human, but a divine testimony,
   equally convincing to the simplest and to the most learned--a testimony
   that must not be cast as pearls before swine, but be limited to those
   who can gather from it noblest fruit viz., to them that are born again.

   And this testimony is not derived from the Pope and his priests, nor
   from the theological faculty with its ministers, but comes with the
   sealing from the Holy Spirit alone. Hence it is a divine testimony, and
   as such stops all contradiction and silences all doubt. It is a
   testimony the same to all, belonging to the peasant in the field and to
   the theologian in his study. Finally, it is a testimony which they
   alone receive who have open eyes, so that they can see spiritually.

   However, this testimony does not work by magic. It does not cause the
   confused mind of unbelief suddenly to cry out: "Surely the Scripture is
   the Word of God!" If this were the case, the way of enthusiasts would
   be open, and our salvation would depend again upon a pretended
   spiritual insight. No, the testimony of the Holy Spirit works in an
   entirely different way. He begins to bring us into contact with the
   Word, either by our own reading or by the communication of others. Then
   He shows us the picture of the sinner according to the Scripture, and
   the salvation which mercifully saved him; and lastly, He makes us hear
   the song of praise upon his lips. And after we have seen this
   objectively, with the eye of the understanding, He then so works upon
   our feeling that we begin to see ourselves in that sinner, and to feel
   that the truth of the Scripture directly concerns us. Finally. He takes
   hold of the will, causing the very power seen in the Scripture to work
   in us. And when thus the whole man, mind, heart, and will, has
   experienced the power of the Word, then He adds to this the
   comprehensive operation of assurance, whereby the Holy Scripture in
   divine splendor commences to scintillate before our eyes.

   Our experience is like that of a person who, from his brightly lighted
   room, looks out in the dusk. At first, owing to the brightness within,
   he sees nothing. But blowing out his light and looking out once more,
   he gradually distinguishes forms and figures, and after a while he
   enjoys the soft twilight. Let us apply this to the Word of God. So long
   as the light of our own insight flashes through the soul, we, looking
   through the window of eternity, fail to perceive anything. It is all
   wrapped in cloudy darkness. But when at last we prevail upon ourselves
   to extinguish that light, and look out again, then we see a divine
   world gradually coming up out of the gloom, and, to our surprise, where
   at first we saw nothing we now see a glorious realm bathed in divine
   light.

   And thus God's elect obtain a firm assurance concerning the Word of God
   that nothing can shake, of which no learning can rob them. They stand
   firm as a wall. They are founded upon a rock. The winds may howl and
   the floods descend, but they fear not. They stay upon their
   indestructible faith, not only as a result of the Holy Spirit's first
   operation, but because He supports the conviction continually. Jesus
   said, "He abideth with you forever"; and this has primary reference to
   this testimony concerning the Word of God. In the believing heart He
   testifies continually: "Fear not, the Scripture is the Word of your
   God."

   However, this is not all of the Holy Spirit's work in regard to the
   Word. It must also be interpreted.

   And He, the Inspirer, alone can give the right interpretation. If among
   men each is the best interpreter of his own word, how much more here
   where no man shall ever have the boldness to say that he understands
   the Spirit's full and proper meaning as well as He Himself, if not
   better? Even if the authors of both Testaments should rise from the
   dead and tell us the meaning of their respective Scriptures--even that
   would not be the full and deep interpretation. For they wrote things
   the comprehensive meaning of which they did not understand. E g., when
   Moses wrote about the serpent's seed, it is obvious that he did not
   begin to see all that is contained in the "bruising of his heel."

   Hence the Holy Spirit alone can interpret the Scripture. And how? After
   the manner of Rome, by means of an official translation as the Vulgate;
   an official interpretation of every word and sentence; and an official
   condemnation of every other explanation?, By no means. This would be
   very easy, but also very unspiritual. Death would cleave to it. The
   full, boundless ocean of truth would be confined within the narrow
   limits of a formula. And the refreshing fragrance of life, which always
   meets us from the sacred page, would at once be lost.

   Surely the churches may not be given over to an arbitrary,
   irresponsible translation of the Word; and we greatly appreciate the
   mutual care of the churches in providing a correct translation in the
   vernacular. We consider it even highly desirable that, under the seal
   of their approval, the churches should publish expository marginal
   readings. But neither the one nor the other should ever replace the
   Scripture itself. Scriptural research must ever be free. And when there
   is spiritual courage, then let the churches revise their translation
   and see whether their expository readings need modification. Not,
   however, to unsettle things every three years, but that in every period
   of vigorous, animated, spiritual life the light of the Holy Spirit may
   be shed in larger measure upon the things that always need more light.

   Hence the work of the Holy Spirit with reference to interpretation is
   indirect, and the means employed are: (1) scientific study; (2) the
   ministry of the Word; and (3) the spiritual experience of the Church.
   And it is by the cooperation of these three factors that, in the course
   of ages, the Holy Spirit indicates which interpretation deviates from
   the truth, and which is the correct understanding of the Word.

   This interpretation is followed by the application.

   The Holy Scripture is a wonderful mystery, which is intended to meet
   the needs and conflicts of every age, nation, and saint. When preparing
   it He foreknew those ages, nations, and saints, and with an eye to
   their necessities He so planned and arranged it as it is now offered to
   us. And only then will the Holy Scripture attain the end in view, when
   to every age, nation, church, and individual it shall be applied in
   such a way that every saint shall receive at last whatever portion was
   reserved for him in the Scripture. Hence this work of application
   belongs to the Holy Spirit alone, for only He knows the relation which
   the Scripture must sustain at last to every one of God's elect.

   As to the manner in which the work is performed, it is either direct or
   indirect.

   The indirect application comes most generally through the ministry,
   which attains its highest end when standing before his congregation the
   minister can say: "This is the message of the Word which at this time
   the Holy Spirit intends for you." An awful claim, indeed, and only
   attainable when one lives as deeply in the Word as in the Church.
   Besides this there is also an application of the Word brought about by
   the spoken or written word of a brother, which sometimes is as
   effectual as a long sermon. The quiet perusal of some exposition of the
   truth has sometimes stirred the soul more effectually than a service in
   the house of prayer.

   The direct application of the Word the Holy Spirit effects by the
   reading of the Scripture or by remembered passages. Then He brings to
   remembrance words deeply affecting us by their singular power. And,
   altho the world smiles and even brethren profess ignorance concerning
   it, it is our conviction that the special application of that moment
   was for us and not for them, and that in our inward souls the Holy
   Spirit performed a work peculiar to Himself.

  XXXIX.

  The Government of the Church.

   "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."--1 Cor.
   xii. 3.

   The last work of the Holy Spirit in the Church has reference to
   government.

   The Church is a divine institution. It is the body of Christ, even tho
   manifesting itself in a most defective way; for as the man whose speech
   is affected by a stroke of paralysis is the same friendly person as
   before, in spite of the defect, so is the Church, whose speech is
   impaired, still the same holy body of Christ. The visible and invisible
   Church are one.

   We have written elsewhere: "The Church of Christ on earth is at once
   visible and invisible. Even as a man is at once a perceptible and
   imperceptible being without being therefore two beings, so does the
   distinction between the Church visible and invisible in no wise impair
   its unity. It is one and the same Church, which according to its
   spiritual being is hidden in the spiritual world, manifest only to the
   spiritual eye, and which according to its visible form manifests itself
   externally to believers and the world.

   "According to its spiritual and invisible being the Church is one in
   all the earth, one also with the Church in heaven. In like manner it is
   also a holy Church, not only because it is skilfully wrought of God,
   dependent entirely upon His divine influences and workings, but also
   because the spiritual defilement and indwelling sin of believers belong
   not to it, but war against it. According to its visible form, however,
   it manifests itself only in fragments. Hence it is local, i.e., widely
   distributed; and the national churches originate because these local
   churches form such connection as their own character and their national
   relations demand. More extensive combinations of churches can only be
   temporal or exceedingly loose and flexible. And these churches, as
   manifestations of the invisible church, are not one, neither are they
   holy; for they partake of the imperfections of all earthly life, and
   are constantly defiled by the power of sin which internally and
   externally undermines their well-being."

   Hence the subject may not be presented as tho the spiritual, invisible,
   and mystical Church were the object of Christ's care and government,
   while the affairs and oversight of the visible Church are left to the
   pleasure of men. This is in direct opposition to the Word of God. There
   is not one visible Church and another invisible; but one Church,
   invisible in the spiritual, and visible in the material world. And as
   God cares both for body and soul, so does Christ govern the external
   affairs of the Church just as certainly as with His grace He nourishes
   it internally.

   Christ is the Lord; Lord not only of the soul, but before He can be
   that He must be Lord of the Church as a whole.

   It should be noticed that the preaching of the Word and the
   administration of the sacraments belong not to the internal economy of
   the Church, but to the external; and that church government serves
   almost exclusively to keep the preaching pure and the sacraments from
   being profaned. Hence it is not expedient to say: "If the Word of God
   be only preached in its purity and the sacraments rightly administered,
   the church order is of minor importance"; eliminate these two from the
   church order and very little remains of it.

   The question is, therefore, whether these means of grace are to be
   arranged according to our pleasure, or according to the will of Jesus.
   Does He allow us to trifle with them according to our own notions, or
   does He rebuke and abhor all self-willed religion? If the last, then
   also He must from heaven direct, govern, and care for His Church.

   However, He does not compel us in this matter; He has left us the awful
   liberty of acting against His Word and of substituting our form of
   government for His own. And that is the very thing which misguided
   Christendom has done again and again. Through unbelief, not seeing the
   King, it has frequently ignored, forgotten, deposed Him; it has
   established its own self-willed rÃ©gime in His Church, until at last the
   very remembrance of the lawful Sovereign has been lost.

   The individual church, still mindful of the kingship of Jesus,
   professes to bow unconditionally to His kingly Word as contained in the
   Scripture. Therefore, we say that in the state church of the
   Netherlands, whose church order not only lacks such profession, but
   lays the supreme legislative power exclusively upon men, Christ's
   Kingship is mocked; that a pretender has usurped His place, who must be
   removed as surely as it is written: "Yet have I set My King upon My
   holy hill of Zion." (Psalm ii. 6)

   Hence it must be maintained firmly and fearlessly that Jesus is not
   only the King of souls, but also King in His Church; whose absolute
   prerogative it is to be the Lawgiver in His Church; and that the power
   which contests that right most be opposed for conscience' sake.

   To the question, why the Church is so apt to forget the Kingship of
   Christ, so that many a godly minister has not the slightest feeling for
   it, often saying: "Surely Jesus is King in the realm of truth, but what
   does He care for the external church? I, at least, a spiritual man,
   never attend the meetings of the official board"; we answer: "If Jesus
   had an earthly throne and thence reigned personally over His Church,
   all men would bow before Him; but being enthroned in heaven at the
   right hand of the Father, the King is forgotten; out of sight, out of
   mind. Hence ignorance concerning the work of the Holy Spirit is the
   cause. Since Jesus governs His Church not directly, but by His Word and
   Spirit, there is no respect for the majesty of His sovereign
   government.

   The spiritual eye of the believer must therefore be reopened for the
   work of the Holy Spirit in the churches. The unspiritual man has no eye
   for it. A consistory, classis, or synod is to him merely a body of men
   convened to transact business according to their own light, the same as
   a meeting of the directors of a board of trade, or some other secular
   organization. One is a shareholder and a committeeman, and as such
   assists in the administration of affairs to the best of his ability.
   But to the child of God, with an eye for the work of the Holy Spirit,
   these church assemblies assume an entirely different aspect. He
   acknowledges that this consistory is no consistory, this classis no
   classis, this synod only apparently so, except the Holy Spirit preside
   and decide matters together with the members.

   The opening prayer of consistory, classis, or synod is therefore not
   the same as that of the Y. M. C. A., or of a missionary convention,
   simply a prayer for light and help, but an entirely different thing. It
   is the petition that the Holy Spirit stand in the midst of the
   assembly. For without Him no ecclesiastical meeting is complete. It can
   not be held except He be present. Hence in the liturgical prayer at the
   opening of consistory, there is first a petition for the Holy Spirit's
   presence and leadership; secondly, the confession that the members can
   do nothing without His presence; and thirdly, a pleading of the
   promises to office-bearers.

   The prayer reads: "Since we are at present assembled in Thy Holy Name,
   after the example of the apostolic churches, to consult, as our office
   requires, about those things which may come before us, for the welfare
   and edification of Thy churches, for which we acknowledge ourselves
   unfit and incapable, as we are by nature unable of ourselves to think
   any good, much less to put it into practise, therefore we beseech Thee,
   O Faithful God and Father, that Thou wilt be pleased to be present with
   Thy Spirit according to Thy promise, in the midst of our present
   assembly, to guide us in all truth."

   In the prayer at the close of the consistory there follows the express
   giving of thanks that the Holy Spirit was present in the meeting:
   "Moreover, we thank Thee that Thou now hast been present with Thy Holy
   Spirit in the midst of our assembly, directing our determinations
   according to Thy will, uniting our hearts in mutual peace and concord.
   We beseech Thee, O faithful God and Father, that Thou wilt graciously
   be pleased to bless our intended labor and effectually to execute Thy
   begun work; always gathering unto Thyself a true church and preserving
   the same in the pure doctrine and in the right use of Thy holy
   sacraments, and in a diligent exercise of discipline."

   Hence church government signifies:

   First, that King Jesus institutes the offices and appoints the
   incumbents.

   Secondly, that the churches submit themselves unconditionally to the
   fundamental law of His Word.

   Thirdly, that the Holy Spirit come in the assembly to direct the
   deliberations; as WalÃ¦us expressed it: "That the Holy Spirit personally
   may stand behind the president to preside in every meeting." And this
   saying is so rich in meaning that we would seriously ask, whether it is
   not yet plain that a mere change of officers avails not, so long as the
   organization itself is not agreeable to the Word of God. The question
   is not whether better men come in power, but whether the Holy Spirit
   preside in the assembly; which He can not do except the Word of God be
   the only rule and authority.

  I.

  The Man to be Wrought upon.

   "Behold, I will pour out My Spirit unto you, I will make known My Words
   unto you."--Prov. i. 23.

   The discussion so far has been confined to the Holy Spirit's work in
   the Church as a whole. We now consider His work in individual persons.

   There is a distinction between the Church as a whole and its individual
   members. There is a Body of Christ, and there are members which
   constitute a part of that Body. And the character of the Holy Spirit's
   work in the one is necessarily different from that of the other.

   The Church, born of divine pleasure, is complete in the eternal
   counsel, and soverign choice has prepared all its course.

   The same God who has numbered the hairs of our head has also numbered
   the members of Christ's Body. As every natural birth is foreordained,
   so is every Christian birth in the Church divinely predestined.

   The origin and awakening of eternal life are from above; not from the
   creature, but from the Creator, and are rooted in His free and soverign
   choice. And it remains not merely a choice, but is followed by a divine
   act equally decisive that enforces and realizes that choice.

   That is God's spiritual omnipotence. He is not as a man who
   experiments, but He is God who, never forsaking the work of His hands,
   is persistant and irresistible in the doing of all His pleasure. Hence
   His counsel becomes history; and the Church, whose form is outlined in
   that counsel, must in the course of ages be born, increase, and perfect
   itself according to that counsel; and since that counsel is
   indestructible the gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church.
   This is the ground of the security and consolation of the saints. They
   have no other ground of trust. From the fact that God is God, and that
   therefore His pleasure shall stand, they draw the sure conviction with
   which they prophesy against all that is visible and phenomenal.

   In the work of grace, there is no trace of chance or fatalism; God has
   determined not only the final issue, leaving the way by which it is to
   be attained undecided, but in His counsel He has prepared every means
   to realize His choice. And in that counsel ways disclose themselves
   which human eye can not trace nor fathom. The divine omnipotence adapts
   itself to the nature of the creature. It causes the cedars of Lebanon
   to grow, and the bulls of Bashan to increase; but it feeds and
   strengthens each according to its nature The cedar eats no grass, and
   the ox does not burrow in the ground for food.

   The divine ordinance requires that by its roots the tree shall absorb
   the juices from the ground, and that by the mouth the ox shall take his
   food and convert it into blood. And He honors His own ordinance by
   providing food in the soil for the one, and grass in the field for the
   other.

   The same principle prevails in the Kingdom of Grace. To man as a
   subject of that Kingdom, and of the moral world belonging to it, God
   has given another organism than to the ox, cedar, wind, or stream. The
   movements of the latter are purely mechanical; from the steep mountain
   the stream must fall. In a different way He acts upon ox and tree; and
   in still another way upon man. In the human body chemical forces work
   mechanically, and other forces like those in the ox and cedar. And
   besides these there are in man moral forces which God operates also
   according to their nature.

   Upon this ground our fathers rejected as unworthy of God the fanatical
   view that in the work of grace man is a stock or block; not because it
   attributes something to man, but because it represents God as denying
   His own work and ordinance. Creating an ox or a tree or stone each
   different from the other, giving each a nature of its own, it follows
   that He can not violate this, but must adapt Himself to it. Hence all
   His spiritual operations are subject to the divinely ordained
   dispositions in man as a spiritual being; and this feature makes the
   work of grace exceedingly beautiful, glorious, and adorable.

   For let us not deceive ourselves and speak any longer of a glorious
   work of grace if the omnipotent God treats man mechanically, as a stock
   or block. Then there is no mystery for angels to look into, but an
   immediate work of omnipotence breaking down and creating anew. To
   admire the work of grace we should take it as it is revealed, i.e., as
   a complicated, unsearchable work by which, violating nothing, God
   adapts Himself to the delicate and manifold needs of man's spiritual
   being; and reveals His divine omnipotence in the victory over the
   endless and gigantic obstacles which human nature puts in His way.

   Even the heart of God thirsts after love. His entire counsel may be
   reduced to one thought, viz., that in the end of the ages He may have a
   Church which shall understand His love and return it. But love can not
   be ordered, neither can it be forced in an unspiritual way. It can not
   be poured out in a man's heart mechanically. To be warm, refreshing,
   and satisfying, love must be quickened, cultivated, and cherished.
   Hence God does not instil an ounce of love into His people's hearts, in
   consequence of which they love Him, but He exhibits love to such an
   extent that He, who was from the beginning with God and was God, in
   unfathomable love dies for men on the cross.

   This would have been superfluous if man were a stock or block. Then God
   would only have had to create love in his heart, and men would have
   loved Him from sheer necessity, as a stove emits heat when the fire is
   lighted. But the love so warmly portrayed in Scripture is not
   superfluous, when God deals with spiritual creatures spiritually. Then
   the cross of Christ is a manifestation of divine love far surpassing
   all human conceptions; hence exercising such irresistible power upon
   all God's elect.

   And that which is preeminently true and apparent in love is equally
   true of every part of the work of grace--in all its stages. In it God
   never denies Himself, nor the ordinance and plan after which man was
   created. Hence it is its glory that, while on the one hand God granted
   man the strongest means of resistance, on the other He overcame that
   resistance in a divine and kingly way by the omnipotence of redeeming
   grace.

   When the apostle testifies, "We pray you in Christ's stead, as tho God
   did beseech you by us, be ye reconciled to God," (2 Cor. v. 20) he
   reveals such a depth of the mystery of love that finally the relations
   are literally reversed, and the holy God beseeches His rebellious
   creature, who instead should cry to Him for mercy.

   Tradition speaks of the fascination of mysterious beings exerted upon
   travelers and mariners so irresistibly that the latter cast themselves
   willingly and yet against their will into destruction. In love's
   revelation this tradition in a reversed and holy manner has become a
   reality. Here also is an almighty power of fascination, in the end
   irresistible to the condemned sinner; but allowing himself to be drawn
   unwillingly and yet willingly, eternal pity draws him not into
   destruction, but out of it.

   However, the wonderful workings of love can scarcely be analyzed.
   Lovers never know who has attracted and who has been attracted, nor how
   in the struggle of the affections love performed its drawings. Love's
   being is too mysterious to reveal its various workings and how they
   succeed one another. And this applies in far greater measure to the
   love of God. Every saint knows by experience that at last it became
   irresistible, and prevailed. But how the victory was achieved can not
   be told. This divine work comes to us from such infinite heights and
   depths, it affects us so mysteriously, and in the beginning there was
   such utter lack of spiritual light that one can scarcely more than
   stammer of these things. Who comprehends the mystery of the natural
   birth? Who had knowledge when he was being curiously embroidered in the
   lowest parts of the earth? And if this took place without our
   consciousness, how can we understand our spiritual birth? Indeed,
   subjectively, i.e., depending upon our own experience, we know
   absolutely nothing of it; and all that ever was or can be said about it
   is taken exclusively from Scripture. It has pleased the Lord to lift
   only a corner of the veil covering this mystery--no more than the Holy
   Spirit deemed necessary for the support of our faith, for the glory of
   God and the benefit of others in the hour of their spiritual birth.

   Wherefore in this series of articles we will try only to systematize
   and explain what God has revealed for the spiritual direction of His
   children.

   Nothing is further from our minds than to exercise ourselves in things
   too high for us, or to penetrate into mysteries hid from our view.
   Where Scripture stops we shall stop; to the difficulties left
   unexplained, we shall not add what must be only the result of human
   folly. But where Scripture proclaims unmistakably Jehovah's sovereign
   power in the work of grace, there neither the criticism nor the mockery
   of men will prevent us from demanding absolute submission to the divine
   sovereignty and giving glory to His Name.
     __________________________________________________________________

  II.

  The Work of Grace a Unit.

   "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
   Ghost, which is given unto us."-- Rom. v. 5.

   The final end of all God's ways is that He may be all in all. He can
   not cease from working until He has entered the souls of individual
   men. He thirsts after the creature's love. In man's love for God He
   desires to see the virtues of His own love glorified. And love must
   spring from man's personal being, which has its seat in the heart.

   The work of grace exhibited in the eternal counsel can never be
   sufficiently praised. From Paradise to Patmos, revealed to prophets and
   apostles, it is transcendently rich and glorious. Prepared in Immanuel,
   who ascended on high, who has received gifts for men, yea, for the
   rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them, it exceeds
   the praise of men and angels. And yet its highest glory and majesty
   appear only when, overcoming the rebellious, operating in the soul, it
   causes its light so to shine that men, seeing it, glorify the Father
   which is in heaven.

   Hence the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is the crowning event of all
   the great events of salvation, because it reveals subjectively, i.e. in
   individual persons, the grace revealed hitherto objectively.

   Assuredly in the days of the Old Covenant saving grace wrought in
   individuals, but it always bore a preliminary and special character.
   Old-Covenant believers "received not the promise, that they without us
   should not be made perfect." (Heb. xi. 39, 40) And the dispensation of
   personal salvation, in its normal character, began only when, the work
   of reconciliation being finished, Immanuel risen, the other Comforter
   had come inwardly to enrich the members of the Body of Christ.

   Hence the purpose of the Triune God steadily urges to this glorious
   consummation. The divine compassion can not cease from working so long
   as the work of saving the individual soul is not begun. In all the
   preparatory work God aims persistently at His elect; not only after the
   fall, but even before creation, His wisdom rejoiced in His earthly
   world, and "His delights were with the sons of men." (Prov. viii. 31)
   From eternity He foreknows all in whom His glorious light shall once be
   kindled. They are no strangers to Him, discovered only after the lapse
   of ages, upon examination either to be passed by as unprofitable, or to
   be wrought upon as proper and useful subjects, according to their
   respective merits; no, our faithful Covenant God never stands as a
   stranger before any of His creatures. He created them all and ordained
   how they should be created; they are not first created, then ordained;
   but ordained, then created. Even then the creature is not independent
   of the Lord, but before there is a word upon his tongue He knoweth it
   altogether; not by information of what already existed, but by divine
   knowledge of what was to come. Even the relations of cause and effect
   connecting the various parts of his life lie naked and open before Him;
   nothing is hid from Him; and much more intimately than man knows
   himself, God knows him.

   The waters of salvation descending from the mountain-tops of God's
   holiness do not flow toward unknown fields, but their channel is
   prepared, and leaping over the mountain-sides they greet the acres
   below which they are to water.

   Hence, altho clearness demands divisions and subdivisions in the work
   of grace, yet they do not actually exist; the work of grace is a unit,
   it is one eternal, uninterrupted act, proceeding from the womb of
   eternity, unceasingly moving toward the consummation of the glory of
   the children of God which shall be revealed in the great and notable
   Day of the Lord. For instance, altho in the moment of regeneration God
   calleth the things that are not, with all that they contain as in a
   germ, yet it should not be represented as tho He had neglected that
   soul for twenty or thirty years. For even this apparent neglect. is a
   divine work. Constrained by His love He would rather have turned to His
   chosen but lost creature immediately, to seek and save it. But He
   refrained Himself, if we may so express it; for this very neglect, this
   hiding of His countenance works together as a means of grace, in the
   hour of love, to make grace efficient in that soul.

   Hence the salvation of a soul in its personal being is an eternal,
   uninterrupted, continuous act, whose starting-point lies in the decree
   whose end is in the glorification before the throne. It contains
   nothing formal or mechanical. There is not a period of eighteen
   centuries first, during which God is occupied with the preparation of
   objective grace, without a single gracious work in individual souls.
   Neither is there salvation prepared only for possible souls whose
   salvation was still uncertain. Nay, the love of God never works toward
   the unknown. He is perfect, and His way is perfect; hence His love,
   always bears the high and holy mark of proceeding from heart to heart,
   from person to person, knowing and reading one with perfect knowledge.
   During all the day while Cain was being judged; while Noah and his
   eight were safe in the ark; while Abraham was called, and Moses talked
   with Jehovah face to face; while the seers were prophesying, the
   Baptist appeared in public, Jesus ascended Calvary, and St. John was
   seeing visions--throughout all those ages God foreknew us (if we are
   His own), the pressure of His love went out steadily toward us, He
   called us before we were, in order that we might come into being, and
   when we had come into being, He led us all our days. Even when we
   rebelled against Him and He turned. His face from us, even then He led
   us as our true and faithful Shepherd. Surely all things must work
   together for good to them that love God, even the lives and characters
   of their ancestor--for they are the called according to His purpose.

   Instead of being cold and formal, it is rather one act of love,
   energizing, pouring forth, shedding itself abroad. From its
   fountain-head on the highest mountains, traversing many highlands
   before it can reach you, divine love flows on, ever restless, until it
   pours itself forth into your soul. Hence the apostle boasts that at
   last love had attained this blessed end in his person and in Rome's
   beloved church. "Now we have peace with God, because the love of God
   (moving toward us from eternity) at last has reached us, and is now
   shed abroad in our heart."

   And this does not mean that now we possess a pure love of our own, but
   that the love of God for His elect, having descended from on high and
   overcome every obstacle, has poured itself into the deep bed of our
   regenerated hearts. And to this He adds the grace of making the soul
   understand, drink, and taste of that love. And when in contrition and
   shamefacedness the soul loses itself in love's delights and in the
   adorations of its eternal compassion, then His glory shines with
   greater brightness, and His rejoicings with the children of men are
   complete.

   However, while the Triune God anticipates from before the foundation of
   the world the ingathering and glorification of the saints, Scripture
   clearly reveals that this ingathering and glorification is the adorable
   work of the Holy Spirit. God's love is shed abroad in our hearts by the
   Holy Spirit who is given unto us.

   The Scripture gives this work of the Spirit a prominent place; not to
   the exclusion of the Father and the Son, yet so that this personal work
   is always effected by the Holy Spirit. And the Scripture puts this so
   strongly that the Catechism speaks, not incorrectly, of three things in
   our most holy faith: of God the Father and our Creation, of God the Son
   and our Redemption, and then only of God the Holy Ghost and our
   Sanctification. And this is not surprising. For--

   First, as we have seen already, in the economy of the Triune God it is
   the Holy Spirit who comes in closest contact with the creature and
   fills him. Hence it is His peculiar work to enter man's heart, and in
   its recesses to proclaim God's grace until he believes.

   Second, He brings every work of the Triune God to its consummation.
   Hence He perfects the work of objective grace by the saving of souls,
   thus realizing its final purpose.

   Third, He quickens life. He hovers over the waters of chaos, and
   breathes into man the breath of life. In perfect harmony with this, the
   sinner dead in trespasses and sin can not live except he be quickened
   by the Spirit of all quickening, whom the Church has always invoked,
   saying: "Veni, Creator Spiritus."

   Fourth, He takes the things of Christ and glorifies Him. The Son does
   not distribute His treasures, but the Holy Spirit. And since the entire
   salvation of the redeemed consists in the fact that their dead and
   withered hearts are joined to Christ, the Source of salvation, we must
   praise the Holy Spirit for doing it.

   Hence in the constraining desire of divine love for the individual
   salvation of chosen but lost creatures, the work of the Holy Spirit
   evidently occupies the most conspicuous place. Our knowledge of God is
   not complete except we know Him as the Blessed Trinity, Father, Son,
   and Holy Ghost. But as "no man cometh to the Father but by Me," (John
   xiv. 6) and "no man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to
   whomsoever the Son will reveal Him," (Matt. xi. 27) so no man can come
   to the Son but by the Holy Spirit, and no man can know the Son if the
   Holy Spirit does not reveal Him unto him.

   But this does not imply any separation, even in thought, between the
   Persons of the Godhead. This would destroy the confession of the
   Trinity, substituting for it the false confession of tri-theism. Nay,
   it is eternally the same God subsisting in three Persons. The truth of
   our confession shines in the very acknowledgment of the unity in the
   Trinity. The Father is never without the Son, nor the Son without the
   Father. And the Holy Spirit can never come to us nor work in us except
   the Father and the Son cooperate with Him.

  III.

  Analysis Necessary.

   "Let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation." --Heb.
   vi. 1.

   To systematize the work of the Holy Spirit in individuals, we must
   first consider their spiritual condition before conversion.

   Misunderstanding concerning this leads to error and confusion. It
   causes the various operations of the Holy Spirit to be confounded, so
   that the same terms are used to designate different things. And this
   confuses one's own thought, and leads others astray. This is most
   seriously apparent in ministers who discuss this subject in general
   terms, artlessly avoid definiteness, and consequently reiterate the
   same platitudes.

   Such preaching makes little or no impression; its monotone is
   wearisome; it accustoms the ear to repetitions; it lacks stimulus for
   the inward ear. And the mind, which can not remain inactive with
   impunity, seeks relief in its own way, often in unbelief, apart from
   the work of the Holy Spirit. The words "heart," "mind," "soul,"
   "conscience," "inward man" are used indiscriminately. There are
   frequent calls for conversion, regeneration, renewing of life,
   justification, sanctification, and redemption; while the ear has not
   been accustomed to understand in each of these a special thing and a
   peculiar revelation of the work of the Holy Spirit. And in the end this
   chaotic preaching makes it impossible to discuss divine things
   intelligently, since one initiated and more thoroughly instructed can
   not be understood.

   We solemnly protest especially against the pious appearance that
   conceals the inward hollowness of this preaching by saying! "My simple
   Gospel has no room for these hair-splitting distinctions; they savor of
   the dry scholasticism with which quibbling minds terrify God's dear
   children, and bring them under the bondage of the letter. Nay, the
   Gospel of my Lord must remain to me full of life and spirit: therefore
   spare me these subtleties."

   And no doubt there is some truth in this. By a dry analysis of
   soul-refreshing truth, abstract minds often rob simple souls of much
   comfort and joy. They discuss spiritual things in the mongrel terms of
   Anglicized Latin, as tho souls could have no part with Christ unless
   they be experts in the use of these bastard words. Such terrifying of
   the weak betrays pride and self-exaltation. And a very foolish pride it
   is, for the boasted knowledge is readily acquired by mere effort of the
   memory. Such externalizing of the Christian faith is offensive. It
   substitutes glibness of tongue for genuine piety, and mental
   justification for that of faith. Thus piety of the heart moves to the
   head, and instead of the Lord Jesus Christ, Aristotle, the master
   teacher of dialectics, becomes the savior of souls.

   To plead for such a caricature is far from our purpose. We believe that
   our salvation depends solely upon God's work in us, and not upon our
   testimony; and the little child with stammering lips, but wrought upon
   by the Holy Spirit, will precede these vain scribes into the Kingdom of
   Heaven. Let no one dare impose the yoke of his own thoughts upon
   others. Christ's yoke alone fits the souls of men.

   And yet the Gospel does not condone shallowness, neither does it
   approve mere twaddle.

   Of course there is a difference. We do not require our children to know
   the names of all the nerves and muscles of the human body, of the
   diseases to which it is subject, and of the contents of the
   pharmacopoeia. It would be a burden to the little fellows, who are
   happiest so long as they are unconscious of the curious organism they
   carry with them. But the physician who is not quite certain as to the
   locality of these vital organs; who, careless of details, is satisfied
   with the generalities of his profession; who, unable to diagnose the
   case correctly, fails to administer the proper remedies, is promptly
   dismissed and a more discriminating one is called in. And to some
   extent the same is required of all intelligent people. Well-informed
   men should not be ignorant of the vital organs of the human body and
   their principal functions; mothers and nurses should be still better
   informed.

   The same applies to the life of the Church. The least gifted among the
   brethren can not understand the distinctions of the spiritual life;
   unable to bear strong meat, they should be fed with milk alone. Neither
   should young children be wearied and blunted with phrases far above
   their comprehension. Both should be taught according to "the tenor of
   their way." A child talking on religious matters in discriminating
   terms unpleasantly affects the spiritual feeling. But not so the
   spiritual physician, i.e., the minister of the Word. If the unskilled
   veterinarian be dismissed, how much more they who, pretending to treat
   and cure souls, betray their own ignorance of the conditions and
   activities of the spiritual life. Wherefore we insist that every
   minister of the Word be a specialist in this spiritual anatomy and
   physiology; familiar with the various forms of spiritual disease, and
   always able out of Christ's fulness to select the spiritual remedies
   required.

   And the same knowledge we claim, if not in the same degree, of every
   intelligent man or woman. The physician or lawyer who smiles at our
   ignorance of the first principles of his profession ought to be equally
   ashamed when betraying his own lamentable ignorance of the condition of
   his soul. In the spiritual life each talent should bear interest. Every
   man ought to be symmetrically developed. According to his range of
   vision, strength of powers, and depth of penetration, he should be able
   to distinguish spiritual things and his own soul's need. And that this
   knowledge is largely found only among our plain, God-fearing people,
   and not among the higher classes, is a serious and deplorable sign of
   the times.

   The knowledge which is power in the spiritual sphere, and able to heal,
   does not come in foreign terms, does not exhaust itself in the various
   criticism of Scripture, fond only of philosophic reasonings, starving
   souls by giving them stones for bread; but it searches the Word and
   work of God in the souls of men systematically, and proves that a man
   has studied the things in which he is to minister to the Church.

   Our spiritual leaders, therefore, who at the university and in the
   catechetical class have replaced this spiritual knowledge by various
   criticism and apologetics, have much to answer for. For the last thirty
   years this knowledge has been neglected in both these institutions. And
   so knowledge was lost, the preaching became monotonous, and a great
   part of the Church perished. There was still eye and ear for the
   objective work of the Son, but the work of the Holy Spirit is slighted
   and neglected. Consequently spiritual life has sunk to such a degree
   that, while scarcely one third of the fulness of grace which is in
   Christ Jesus is being known and honored, men dare to assert that they
   preach Christ and Him crucified.

   Hence the discussion of the Holy Spirit's work in individuals demands
   that, while risking the danger of being called "scholastic drivers," we
   leave the paths of shallowness and generalities and proceed to careful
   analysis. The Holy Spirit's operations upon the various parts of our
   being in their several conditions must be distinguished and treated
   separately; not only in the elect, but also in the non-elect, for they
   are not the same. It is true the Scripture teaches that God causes His
   sun to shine upon the good and the evil, and His rain to come down upon
   the just and the unjust, so that in nature every good gift coming down
   from the Father of lights is common to all; but in the kingdom of grace
   this is not so. The Sun of righteousness often shines upon one, leaving
   another in darkness; and the drops of grace often water one soul, while
   others remain utterly deprived of them.

   Hence, altho the Spirit's work in the elect is of primary importance,
   yet it does not exhaust His work in individuals. Christ was set also
   for a fall to many in Israel; and even this is wrought by the witness
   of the Holy Spirit. Not only the savor of life, but the savor of death
   also reaches the soul by Him; as the apostle declares regarding those
   who, having received the gift of the Holy Ghost, had fallen away. His
   activity in them, and their condition when He begins His saving or
   hardening operations, must be carefully noticed.

   Of course, this is not the place to discuss the condition of fallen man
   exhaustively. This would require special inquiry. Many things which
   perhaps elsewhere will be explained more in detail can here receive but
   passing notice. But it will serve our purpose if we succeed in giving
   the reader such a clear view of the sinner's condition that he can
   understand us when we discuss the Holy Spirit's work upon the sinner.

   By a sinner we understand man as he is, lives, and moves by nature,
   i.e., without grace. And in that state he is dead in trespasses and
   sin; alienated from the life of God; wholly depraved and without
   strength; a sinner, and therefore guilty and condemned. And not only
   dead, but lying in the midst of death, ever sinking more deeply into
   death, which if not checked in its course opens underneath ever more
   widely, until eternal death stands revealed.

   This is the fundamental thought, the mother-idea, the principal
   conception, of his state. "By one man sin entered into the world, and
   death by sin, and so death passed upon all men." (Rom. v. 12) And "the
   wages of sin is death." (Rom. vi. 23) "Sin being finished bringeth
   forth death." (James i. 15) To be translated into another state, one
   must pass from death into life.

   But this general idea of death must be analyzed in its several
   relations, and to this end it must be determined what man was before,
   and what he has become after, this spiritual death.

  IV.

  Image and Likeness.

   "Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness." --Gen. i. 26.

   Glorious is the divine utterance that introduces the origin and
   creation of man: "And God created man after His own image and after His
   own likeness; after the image of God created He him" (Dutch
   translation).

   The significance of these important words was recently discussed by the
   well-known professor, Dr. Edward BÃ¶hl, of Vienna. According to him it
   should read: Man is created "in", not "after" God's image, i.e., the
   image is not found in man's nature or being, but outside of him in God.
   Man was merely set in the radiance of that image. Hence, remaining in
   its light, he would live in that image. But stepping out of it, he
   would fall and retain but his own nature, which before and after the
   fall is the same. [18]

   In the discussion of the corruption of the human nature we will
   consider this opinion of the highly esteemed professor of Vienna. Let
   us state here simply that we reject this opinion, in which we see a
   return to Rome's errors. Dr. BÃ¶hl's negative character of sin, which is
   the basis of this representation, we can not entertain. Moreover, it
   opposes the doctrine of the Incarnation, and of Sanctification as held
   by the Reformed Church. Hence we believe it to be safest, first to
   explain the confession of the fathers concerning this, and then to show
   that this representation is inconsistent with the Word.

   Accepting the account of Creation as the Holy Spirit's direct
   revelation, we acknowledge its absolute credibility in every part. They
   who do not so accept it, or who, like many Ethical theologians, deny
   the literal interpretation, can have no voice in the discussion. If in
   the exposition of the account we are in earnest, and do not trifle with
   words, we must be thoroughly convinced that God actually said: "Let Us
   make men after Our image and after Our likeness." (Gen. i. 26) But
   denying this and holding that these words merely represent the form in
   which somebody, animated by the Holy Spirit, presented man's creation
   to himself, we can deduce nothing from them. Then we have no security
   that they are divine; we know only that a pious man attributed these
   thoughts to God and laid them upon His lips while they were but his own
   account of man's creation:

   Hence the infallibility of Sacred Scripture is our starting-point. We
   see in Gen. i. 27 a direct testimony of the Holy Spirit; and with
   fullest assurance we believe that these are the words of the Almighty
   spoken before He created man. With this conviction, they have decisive
   authority; and bowing before it, we confess that man was created after
   God's likeness and after His image.

   This statement, in connection with the whole account, shows that the
   Holy Spirit sharply distinguishes man's creation and that of all other
   creatures. They were all manifestations of God's glory, for He saw that
   they were good; an effect of His counsel, for they embodied a divine
   thought. But man's creation was special, more exalted, more glorious;
   for God said: "Let Us make men after Our image and after Our likeness."

   Hence the general sense of these words is that man is totally different
   from all other beings; that his kind is nobler, richer, more glorious;
   and especially that this higher glory consists in the more intimate
   bond and closer relation to his Creator.

   This appears from the words image and likeness. In all His other
   creative acts the Lord speaks, and it is done; He commanded, and it
   stood fast. There is a thought in His counsel, a will to execute it,
   and an omnipotent act to realize it, but no more; beings are created
   wholly outside and apart from Him. But man's creation is totally
   different. Of course, there is a divine thought proceeding from the
   eternal counsel, and by omnipotent power this thought is realized; but
   that new creature is connected with the image of God.

   According to the universal significance of the word, a person's image
   is such a concentration of his essential features as to make it the
   very impress of his being. Whether it be in pencil, painting, or by
   photography, a symbol, an idea, or statue, it is always the
   concentration of the essential features of man or thing. An idea is an
   image which concentrates those features upon the field of the mind; a
   statue in marble or bronze, etc., but regardless of form or manner of
   expression, the essential image is such a concentration of the several
   features of the object that it represents the object to the mind. This
   fixed and definite significance of an image must not be lost sight of.
   The image maybe imperfect, yet as long as the object is recognized in
   it, even tho the memory must supply the possible lack, it remains an
   image.

   And this leads to an important observation: The fact that we can
   recognize a person from a fragmentary picture proves the existence of a
   soul-picture of that person, i.e., an image photographed through the
   eye upon the soul. This image, occupying the imagination, enables us
   mentally to see him even in his absence and without his picture.

   How is such image obtained? We do not make it, but the person himself,
   who while we look at him draws it upon the retina, thus putting it into
   our soul. In photography it is not the artist, nor his apparatus, but
   the features of our own countenance which as by witchery draw our image
   upon the negative plate. In the same manner the person receiving our
   image is passive, while we putting it into his soul are active. Hence
   in deepest sense, each of us carries his own image in or upon his face,
   and puts it into the human soul or upon the artist's plate. This image
   consists of features which, concentrated, form that peculiar expression
   which shows one's individuality. A man forms his own shadow upon a wall
   after his own image and likeness. As often as we cause the impress of
   our being to appear externally, we make it after our own image and
   likeness.

   Returning, after these preliminary remarks, to Gen. i. 27, we notice
   the difference between (1) the divine image after which we are created,
   and (2) the image which consequently became visible in us. The image
   after which God made man is one, and that fixed in us quite another.
   The first is God's image after which we are created, the other the
   image created in us. To prevent confusion, the two must be kept
   distinct. The former existed before the latter, else how could God have
   created man after it?

   It is not strange that many have thought that this image and likeness
   referred to Christ, who is said to be "the Image of the invisible God,"
   (Col. i. 15) and "the express Image of His Substance." (Heb. i. 3) Not
   a few have accepted this as settled. Yet, with our best ministers and
   teachers, we believe this incorrect. It conflicts with the words, "Let
   Us make men after Our image and after Our likeness," (Gen. i. 26) which
   must mean that the Father thus addressed the Son and the Holy Spirit.
   Some say that these words are addressed to the angels, but this can not
   be so, since man is not created after the image of angels. Others
   maintain that God addressed Himself, arousing Himself to execute His
   design, using" We" as a plural of majesty. But this does not agree with
   the immediately following singular: "And God created man after His
   image." (Gen. i. 27) Hence we maintain the tried explanation of the
   Church's wisest and godliest ministers, that by these words the Father
   addressed the Son and the Holy Spirit. And then the unity of the Three
   Persons expresses itself in the words: "And God created man after His
   image." Hence this image can not be the Son. How could the Father say
   to the Son and to the Holy Spirit: "Let Us make men after the image of
   the Son"?

   That image must be, therefore, a concentration of the features of God's
   Being, by which He expresses Himself. And since God alone can represent
   His own Being to Himself, it follows that by the image of God we must
   understand the representation of His Being as it eternally exists in
   the divine consciousness.

   "Image" and "likeness" we take to be synonyms; not because a difference
   could not be invented; but because in ver. 27 the word "likeness" is
   not even mentioned. Hence we oppose the explanation that image refers
   to the soul, and likeness to the body. Allowing that by the
   indissoluble union of body and soul the features of the divine image
   must have an after-effect in the latter, which is His temple, yet there
   is no reason nor suggestion why we should support such a precarious
   distinction between image and likeness. Hence the image after which we
   are created is the expression of God's Being as it exists in His own
   consciousness.

   The next question is: What was or is there in man that caused him to be
   created after that image?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18] In the Dutch the preposition "in" has not the meaning of
   "conformably to," as in the English, but denotes rest or motion within
   limits, whether of place, time, or circumstances. With nouns or
   adjectives the word governed by "in" indicates the sphere, the domain
   where a property manifests itself. Hence the Dutch expression,
   "Geschapen in het, beeld God's" (created in the divine image),
   indicates the sphere in which Adam moved before he fell.--Trans.

  Original Righteousness.

   "For in Him we live and move, and have our being: as certain also of
   your own poets have said. For we are also His offspring." --Acts xvii.
   28.

   It is the peculiar characteristic of the Reformed Confession that more
   than any other it humbles the sinner and exalts the sinless man.

   To disparage man is unscriptural. Being a sinner, fallen and no longer
   a real man, he must be humbled, rebuked, and inwardly broken. But the
   divinely created man, realizing the divine purpose or restored by
   omnipotent grace in the elect, is worthy of all praise, for God has
   made him after His own image.

   Because he stood so high, he fell so low. He was such an excellent
   being, hence he became such a detestable sinner. The excellency of the
   former is the source of the damnableness of the latter.

   It is said that while the present age properly appreciates and exalts
   man, our doctrine only disparages him; but with all its eulogy and
   praise this present age has never conceived a more exalted testimony
   than that of Scripture, saying: "God created man in His own image."
   (Gen. i. 27) We protest against the cry of the age, not because it
   makes of man too much, but too little, asserting that he is glorious
   even now in his fallen state.

   What would you think of the man who, walking through your
   flower-garden, laid waste by a violent thunder-storm, called the stem
   broken and mud-covered flowers, lying upon their disordered beds,
   magnificent? And this the present age is doing. Walking through the
   garden of this world, withered and disordered by sin's thunderstorms,
   it cries in proud ecstasy: "What glorious beings these men! How fair
   and excellent!" And as the botanist would say regarding his disordered
   garden: "Do you call this beautiful? You should have seen it before the
   storm destroyed it"; so say we to this age: "Do you call this fallen
   man glorious? Compared to what he ought to be he is utterly worthless.
   But he was glorious before sin ruined him, shining in all the beauty of
   the divine image."

   Hence our doctrine exalts him to highest glory. Next to the glory of
   being created after the image of God comes the glory of being God
   Himself. As soon as man presumes to this he thrusts at once all his
   glory from him; it is his detestable sin that he aspires to be like
   God. If it be said that even in Paradise the law prevailed that God
   alone is great, and the creature nothing before Him; we answer, that he
   that is created after the divine image has no higher ambition than to
   be a reflection of God; excluding the idea of being above or against
   God. Hence it is certain that the original man was most glorious and
   excellent; wherefore fallen man is most despicable and miserable.

   Has fallen man then lost the image of God?

   This vital question controls our view of man in every respect, and
   hence requires closest examination; especially since the opinions of
   believers concerning this are diametrically opposed. Some maintain that
   after the fall man retained a few remains of it, and others that he has
   entirely lost it.

   To avoid all misunderstanding, we must first decide whether to be
   created after the image of God (1) refers only to the original
   righteousness, or (2) included also man's nature which was clothed with
   this original righteousness. If the divine image consisted only in the
   original righteousness, then, of course, it was completely and
   absolutely lost; for by his fall man lost this original righteousness
   once for all. But if it was also impressed upon his being, his nature,
   and upon his human existence, then it can not disappear entirely; for,
   however deeply sunk, fallen man remains man.

   By this we do not imply that something spiritually good was left in
   man; among the finally lost even the deepest fallen will retain some
   evidence that he was created after the divine image. We do not even
   hesitate to subscribe to the opinion of the fathers that if the angels,
   Satan included, were originally created after God's image (which
   Scripture does not teach positively), then even the devil in his deep
   fiendishness must show some features of that image.

   We do not mean that after the fall man had any willingness, knowledge,
   or anything good; and they who in pulpit or writing infer this from
   "the few remains" of article xiv. of the Confession of Faith pervert
   its plain teaching. Altho it acknowledges that a few remains are
   retained, yet it follows that "all the light which is in us is changed
   into darkness''; and it says before that "man is become wicked,
   perverse, and corrupt in all his ways," and "that he has corrupted his
   whole nature." Hence these "few remains" may never be understood to
   imply that there remained in man any strength, willingness, or desire
   for good. No, a sinner in his fallen nature is altogether condemnable.
   And there is, as the same article confesses, "no will nor understanding
   conformable to the divine will and understanding, but what Christ has
   wrought in man, which He teacheth us when He said, "Without Me ye can
   do nothing."

   And thus we disarm any suspicion that we look for something good in the
   sinner.

   With Scripture we confess: "There is none righteous, no not one. There
   is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They
   are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable;
   there is none that doeth good, no, not one."

   But how is this to be reconciled? How can these two go together? On the
   one hand the sinner has nothing, absolutely nothing good or
   praiseworthy; and on the other, this same sinner always retains
   features of the image of God!

   Let us illustrate. Two horses become mad; the one is a common truck
   horse, the other a noble Arabian stallion. Which is the more dangerous?
   The latter, of course. His noble blood will break loose into more
   uncontrollable rage and violence. Or two clerks work in an office; the
   one a mere drudge of slow understanding, the other a youth with brains
   and piercing eye. Which could do his master the greater injury? The
   latter, of course, and all his schemes would show his superiority
   working in the wrong direction. This is always the case. There is no
   more dangerous enemy of the truth than an unbeliever religiously
   instructed. In all his impious rage he shows his superior training and
   knowledge. Satan is so mighty because before his fall he was so
   exceedingly glorious. Hence in his fall man did not put off the
   original nature, but he retained it. Only its action was reversed,
   corrupted, and turned against God.

   When the captain of a man-of-war in a naval engagement betrays his king
   and raises the enemy's flag, he does not first damage or sink his ship,
   but he keeps it as efficient for service as possible, and with all its
   armament intact he does the very reverse of what he ought to do.
   "Optimi coruptio pessima!" says the proverb of the wise--i.e., the
   greater the excellency of a thing, the more dangerous its defection. If
   the admiral of the fleet were to choose which of his ships should
   betray him, he would say: "Let it be the weakest, for defection of the
   strongest is the most dangerous." It is true in every sphere of life
   that the excellent qualities of a thing or being do not disappear in
   reversed action, but become most excellently bad.

   In this way we understand man's fall. Before it he possessed the most
   exquisite organism which by holy impulse was directed toward the most
   exalted aim. Tho reversed by the fall, this precious human instrument
   remained, but, directed by unholy impulse, it aims at a deeply unholy
   object.

   Comparing man to a steamship, his fall did not remove the engine. But
   as before the fall he moved in righteousness, so he moves now in
   unrighteousness. In fact, as fast as he steamed then toward felicity,
   so fast he steams now toward perdition, i.e., away from God. Hence the
   retaining of the engine made his fall all the more terrible and his
   destruction more certain. And thus we reconcile the two: that man
   retained his former features of excellency, and that his destruction is
   sure except he be born again.

   But in the divine image we must carefully distinguish:

   First, the wonderful and artistic organism called human nature.

   Second, the direction in which it moved, i.e., toward the holiest end,
   in that God created man in original righteousness.

   That God created man good and after His own image does not mean that
   Adam was in a state of innocence, in that he had not sinned; nor that
   he was perfectly equipped to become holy, gradually to ascend to
   greater development; but that he was created in true righteousness and
   holiness, indicating not the degree of his development, but his status.
   This was his original righteousness. Hence all the inclinations and
   outgoings of his heart were perfect. He lacked nothing. Only in one
   respect his blessedness differed from that of God's children, viz., his
   good was losable and theirs not.

   Of these two parts constituting the divine image--first, the inward,
   artistic organism of man's being, and, second, the original
   righteousness in which the organism moved naturally--the latter is
   completely lost, and the former is reversed; but the being of the
   instrument, tho terribly marred, remained the same, to work in the
   wrong direction, i.e., in unrighteousness. Hence the features or
   after-effects of the divine image are not found in the few good things
   that remain in the sinner, "but in all that he does." Man could not sin
   so terribly if God had not created him after His own image.

   Scripture teaches, therefore, that they are all gone aside, that they
   are altogether become filthy, and that all come short of the glory of
   God; while it also declares that even this fallen man is created after
   God's image--Gen. ix. 6, and after His likeness--James iii. 9.

  Rome, Socinus, Arminius, Calvin.

   "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness."--Ephes. iv. 24.

   It is not surprising that believers entertain different views
   concerning the significance of the image of God. It is a starting-point
   determining the direction of four different roads. The slightest
   deviation at starting must lead to a totally different representation
   of the truth. Hence every thinking believer must deliberately choose
   which road he will follow:

   First, the path of Rome, represented by Bellarminus.

   Second, that of Arminius and Socinus, walking arm-in-arm.

   Third, that of the majority of the Lutherans, led by Melanchthon.

   Lastly, the direction mapped out by Calvin, i.e., that of the Reformed.

   Rome teaches that the original righteousness does not belong to the
   divine image, but to the human nature as a superadded grace. Quoting
   Bellarminus, first, man is created consisting of two parts, flesh and
   spirit; second, the divine image is stamped partly on the flesh, but
   chiefly on the human spirit, the seat of the moral and rational
   consciousness; third, there, is a conflict between flesh and spirit,
   the flesh lusting against the spirit; fourth, hence man has a natural
   inclination and desire for sin, which as desire alone is no sin as long
   as it is not yielded to; fifth, in His grace and compassion God gave
   man, independently of his nature, the original righteousness for a
   defense and safety-valve to control the flesh; sixth, by his fall man
   has willingly thrust this superadded righteousness from him: hence as
   sinner he stands again in his naked nature (in puris naturalibus)
   which, as a matter of course, is inclined to sin, inasmuch as his
   desires are sinful.

   We believe that the Romish theologians will allow that this is the
   current view among them. According to Catechismus Romanus, question 38:
   "God gave to man from the dust of the earth a body, in such a way that
   he was partaker of immortality not by virtue of his nature, but by a
   superadded grace. As to his soul, God formed him in His image and after
   His likeness, and gave him a free will; moreover [proeterea, besides,
   hence not belonging to his nature], He so tempered his desires that
   they continually obey the dictates of reason. Besides this He has
   poured into him the original righteousness, and gave him dominion over
   all other creatures."

   The view of Socinus, and of Arminius who followed him closely, is
   totally different. It is a well-known fact that the Socinians denied
   the Godhead of Christ, who, as they taught, was born a mere man. But
   (and by this they misled the Poles and Hungarians) they acknowledged
   that He had become God. Hence after His Resurrection He could be
   worshiped as God. But in what sense? That the divine nature was given
   Him? Not at all. In Scripture, magistrates, being clothed with the
   divine majesty which enabled them to exercise authority, are called
   "gods." This applies to Jesus, who, after His Resurrection, received of
   the Father power over all creatures in an eminent degree. Hence He is
   absolutely clothed with divine majesty. If a sinner, as a magistrate,
   is called god, how much more can we conceive of Christ as being called
   God, simply to express that He was clothed with divine authority?

   In order to support this false view of Christ's Godhead, the Socinians
   falsified the doctrine of the image of God, and made it equivalent to
   man's dominion over the animals. This was in their opinion also a kind
   of higher majesty, containing something divine, which was the image of
   God. Hence the first Adam, being clothed with majesty and dominion over
   a portion of creation, was therefore of God's offspring and created in
   His image. And the second Adam, Christ, also clothed with majesty and
   dominion over creation, the Scripture therefore calls God.

   That the Remonstrants also adopted this doubly false representation
   appears conclusively from what the moderate professor Ã€ Limborch wrote
   in the beginning of the eighteenth century: "This image consisted in
   the power and exalted position which God gave to man above all
   creation. By this dominion he shows most clearly the image of God in
   the earth." He adds: "That in order to exercise this power, he was
   endowed with glorious talents. But these are only means. Dominion over
   the animals is the principal thing." Hence we infer that the bravest
   and coarsest tamer of animals" playing with lions and tigers as if pet
   dogs, is the tenderest child of God. We say this in all seriousness and
   without a thought of mockery, to show the foolishness of the Socinian
   system.

   The Lutheran view, as will be seen, occupies the middle ground between
   the Roman Catholic and the Reformed.

   Its most prominent part (readily recognized in the representation of
   Dr. BÃ¶hl) is that the divine image is merely the original
   righteousness. They do not deny that man, as man, in his nature and
   being shows something beautiful and excellent, reminding one of the
   image of God; but the real image itself is not in man's nature, nor in
   his spiritual being, but only in the original wisdom and righteousness
   in which God created him. Gerhardt writes: "The real similarity with
   God lay in the soul of man, partly in his intelligence, partly in his
   moral and rational inclinations, which three excellencies together
   constitute his original righteousness." And Bauer: "Properly speaking,
   this image of God consists of some perfections of will, intellect, and
   feeling which God created together with man (concreatas), which is the
   original righteousness." Hence the Lutheran doctrine teaches that the
   proper image of God is now totally lost, and that the sinner is as
   helpless before the work of grace as a stock or block, as one fettered
   and unable even to rattle his chain.

   The Reformed, on the contrary, have always denied this; and taught that
   the image of God, being one with His likeness, did not consist only in
   the original righteousness, but included also man's being and
   personality; not only his state, but also his being. Hence the original
   righteousness was not something additional, but his being, nature, and
   state were originally in the most beautiful harmony and causal
   relation. Ursinus says: "The image of God has reference: (1) to the
   immaterial substance of the soul with its gifts of knowledge and will;
   (2) to all in-created knowledge of God and of His will; (3) to the holy
   and righteous inclination of the will, and moving of the heart, i.e.,
   the perfect righteousness; (4.) to the bliss, holy peace, and abundance
   of all enjoyment; and (5) to the dominion over the creatures. In all
   these our moral nature reflects the image of God, tho imperfectly. St.
   Paul explains the image of God from the true righteousness and
   holiness, without excluding, however, the wisdom and in-created
   knowledge of God. He rather presupposes them."

   These four views concerning the divine image present four opposing
   opinions that are clearly drawn and sharply outlined. The Socinian
   conceives of the image of God as entirely outside of man and his moral
   being, and consisting in the exercise of something resembling divine
   authority. The Roman Catholic does indeed look for the divine image in
   man, but severs him from the divine ideal, i.e., the original
   righteousness which is put upon him as a garment. The Lutheran, like
   the Socinian, puts the divine image outside of man, exclusively in the
   divine ideal, which he considers not as foreign to man, but calculated
   for him and originally created in his nature (however distinct from
   it). Lastly, the Reformed confesses that man's whole personality is the
   impress of God's image in his being and attributes; to which belongs
   naturally that ideal perfection expressed in the confession of original
   righteousness.

   Undoubtedly the Reformed confession is the purest and most excellent
   expression of the Bible revelation; hence we maintain it from deepest
   conviction. It maintains that God created man in His image, and not his
   nature only, like Rome; nor his authority only, like the Socinians; nor
   his righteousness only, like the Lutherans.

   His divine image does not belong merely to an attribute, state, or
   quality of man, but to the whole man; for He created man in His image;
   and the confession which subtracts from this detracts from the positive
   Scriptural statement, i.e., from the Spirit's direct testimony: "Let Us
   make man in Our image and after Our likeness," (Gen. i. 26) and not:
   "Let Us re-form man in Our image."

   Neither is the divine image only in man's personality, as the
   Vermittelungs (Mediation) theologians, following Fichte, hold. Man's
   personality certainly belongs to it, but it is not all, nor even the
   principal thing. Personality is contrast to our equals, and contrast
   can not be after the image of God, for God is One. Personality is a
   very feeble feature of the divine image. True personality is no
   contrast, but glorious completeness, like that in God. One person is
   something defective; three persons in one being, completeness.

   Wherefore we protest against these loud and emphatic assertions that
   the image is our imperfect personality, as leading the Church away from
   the Scripture. No; man himself is the image of God, his whole being as
   man--in his spiritual existence, in the being and nature of his soul,
   in the attributes and workings that adorn and express his being; not as
   tho this human being were a locomotive without steam, posing as a
   model, but a living and active organism exerting influence and power.

   As a being man is not defective, but perfect; not in a state of
   becoming, but of being--i.e., he was not to become righteous, but was
   righteous. This is his original righteousness. Hence, that God created
   man in His image signifies:

   1. That man's being is in finite form the impress of the infinite Being
   of God.

   2. His attributes are in finite form the impress of God's attributes.

   3. His state was the impress of the felicity of God.

   4. The dominion which he exercised was image and impress of God's
   dominion and authority.

   To which may be added that, since man's body is calculated for the
   spirit, it also must contain some shadows of that image.

   This confession the Reformed churches must maintain in the pulpit, in
   the catechetical classes, and above all in the recitation halls of
   theology.

  VII.

  The Neo-Kohlbruggians.

   "And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own
   likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth."--Gen. v. 3.

   Many are the efforts made to alter the meaning of the word, "Let Us
   make man in Our image and after Our likeness," (Gen. i. 26) by a
   different translation; especially by making it to read "in" instead of
   "after" our likeness. This new reading is Dr. BÃ¶hl's main support. With
   this translation his system stands or falls.

   According to him, man is not the bearer of the divine image, but by a
   divine act he was set in it, as a plant is set in the sun. As long as
   the plant stood in the dark, its shape and flowers are invisible;
   carried into the light its beauty becomes apparent. In like manner, man
   was without luster until God put him in the shining glory of His image,
   and then he appeared beautiful. Of course, this idea requires the
   translation: "Let Us create man in Our image." (Gen. i. 26)

   Let us explain the difference: Gen. i. 26 in the Hebrew has two
   different prepositions. The one standing before "likeness" (k) is
   invariably used in comparisons; while the other before "image" is
   mostly used to denote that one thing is found in another. Hence the
   translation, "In our image and after our likeness," has apparently much
   in its favor. This translation (altho we believe it to be incorrect;
   for our reasons see the next article) does not alter the meaning, if
   rightly interpreted.

   And what is that right interpretation? Not that of Dr. BÃ¶hl; for,
   according to him, the newly created man did not stand in the midst of
   that image, but only in its reflection and radiation. The plant is not
   set in the sun, but in the sun-rays. No; if Adam stood in the midst of
   God's image, then he was wholly encompassed by it.

   Let us illustrate. There are wooden images covered with paper on which
   is printed a head or bust, colored to imitate marble or bronze. The
   wood may be said to be in the image, covered by it from all sides.
   Again, the sculptor actually chisels the image, in his mind, or posing
   as a model, about the marble until it encloses the whole black. In like
   manner it may be said that Adam, upon his first awakening to
   consciousness, was enclosed by God's image; not externally, and he only
   its reflection, but its ectype penetrating his whole being.

   The correctness of this exegesis appears from Gen. v. 1-3, the contents
   of which, tho often overlooked, settle this matter. Here Scripture
   brings Adam's creation in direct connection with his own begetting a
   son after his own likeness. We read: "In the day that God created man,
   in the likeness of God made He him; male and female created He them;
   and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were
   created. And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
   his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth."

   In both instances the Hebrew word zelem, image, is used. Hence to
   obtain a clear and correct understanding of the statement, "to be
   created in the image and after the likeness of God," Scripture invites
   us to let the child's resemblance to the father assist us. And the
   father's likeness lies in the child's being, is part of it, and does
   not merely beam from the father upon the child externally. Even in his
   absence or after his death the resemblance of features continues.

   Hence to beget a child in our image and after our likeness means to
   give existence to a being bearing our image and resemblance, altho as a
   person distinct from us. From which it must follow that when Scripture
   says, regarding Adam, that God created him in His image and after His
   likeness, using the same words "image" (zelem) and "likeness"
   (demoeth), it can not mean that the divine image shone upon him, so
   that he stood and walked in its light; but that God so created him that
   his whole being, person, and state reflected the divine image, since he
   carried it in himself.

   It is remarkable that the prepositions used in Gen. i. 26 appear also
   in this passage, but in a reversed order. Rendering the preposition "k"
   "in," as in Gen. i. 26, it reads: "He begat a son in his likeness and
   after his image." And this is conclusive. It shows how utterly unfair
   it is to deduce a different meaning from the use of different
   prepositions. Even if we translate "Ã«E by "in"--"in the image of
   God"--the sense is the same; in both, the image is not a reflection
   falling upon man, indicating his state only, but also his form, both
   state and being.

   However, before we proceed, let Dr. BÃ¶hl speak for himself. For we
   might possibly have wrongly understood him; it is therefore reasonable
   that his own words be laid before our readers.

   We take these citations from his work; entitled, "Von der Incarnation
   des Gottlichen Wortes"; a dogmatic, highly important book, wherein he
   deals the Vermittellungs theologians blows that have filled our hearts
   with joy, partly because God is honored thereby, and also because of
   the consolation offered to broken hearts. Hence it does not enter our
   minds to belittle the labor of Dr. BÃ¶hl. We only contend that his
   presentation of the image of God is not the true one. We point,
   therefore, to the important and exceedingly clear sentences of pages 28
   and 29:

     "Gott nun veranstaltete es so, dass der Mensch gleich anfangs unter
     den Einfluss des Guten zu stehen kam and somit das Gute that. Er
     schuf ihn im Bilde Gottes, nach seiner Gleichheit (Gen. i. 26). Was
     dies heisst, wird dann erst recht deutlich, wenn wir die
     Wiederherstellung des gefallenen Menschen (nach Ephes. iv. 24; Col.
     iii. 9) in Betracht ziehen. Paulus blickt hier auf den anfÃ¤nglichen
     Zustand hin, wenn er redet von dam neuen Menschen, den wir nach
     Ausziehung des alten anzuziehen hÃ¤tten. Er bezeichnet nun diesen
     neuen Menschen als einen Gott gemÃ¤ss geschaffen (Kappa tau iota
     sigma theta epsilon w/ tonos nu tau alpha) in Gerechtigkeit und
     Heiligkeit, wie sie nach Wahrheit ist. Diese apostolischen AusdrÃ¼cke
     enthalten sine Umschreibung jener Ausstattung, welche Mose mit den
     Worten: Im Bilde Gottes, nach seiner Gleichheit' kennzeichnet. Die
     Wiedergeburt ist sine neue SchÃ¶pfung, die aber nach der Vorschrift
     der alten bestellt ist, ohne etwas davon- nosh dazuzuthun. Der Stand
     im Bilde Gottes, in dem der Mensch nach der Gleichheit Gottes war,
     ist also etwas, was man von dem Menschen hinwegnehmen kann, ohne die
     Creatur Gottes selbst aufzuheben. Es ist dem Apostel weiter
     eigenthÃ¼mlich, die Bewegungen des neuen Menschen unter dem Bilde von
     verschiedenen GewÃ¤ndern darzustellen, die man anzuziehen habe (Col.
     iii. 12 ff.). Grund and Veranlassung fÃ¼r solche Umwandlung ist
     Christus, der Geist, den Christus vom Voter her sendet, oder der
     Stand in Christo odes in der Gnade (z.B. 2 Cor. v. 17; Gal. v. 16,
     18, 25; Rom. v. 2) Und ganz ebenso ist nach Gen. i. 26 Grund fÃ¼r die
     Gleichheit mit Gott der Stand im Bilde Gottes." [19]

   The words in italics dispel, alas! all doubt. It is possible to
   conceive of the image of God as having completely disappeared, and yet
   man remaining man.

   Dr. BÃ¶hl repeats this, clearly in the following words (p. 29):

   "Wenn wir nun die Creatur aus jenem Stande hinausgetreten denken, so
   bleibt diese Creatur intact." [20]

   This goes so far that Dr. BÃ¶hl himself felt how closely he thus
   returned to the boundaries of Rome, for which reason he continues,
   saying:

   "Nur freilich, dass diese Creatur nicht, wie die romische Kirche lehrt,
   immer noch genug Ã¼brig behÃ¤lt, um sich wieder mit Hilfe des
   Gnadengeschenkes Christi selbst zu rehabilitiren. Sondern nach dem
   Falle ist der Mensch and zwar sein Ich mit den dem Menschen
   anerschaffenen hÃ¶chsten Gaben (siehe Calvin, Inst.,' ii., 1, 9) aus der
   rechten Stellung herausgetreten und dem Tode als Herscher, dem Gesetz
   als unbarmherziger Treibert preisgegeben." [21]

   But stronger still: Dr. BÃ¶hl is so firmly attached to this presentation
   that he says even of Christ, that He, before His Resurrection, lacked
   the divine image. See page 45: "Our Lord and Savior stood outside the
   image of God." "Ausserhalb des Bildes Gottes stand unser Herr." Which
   is all the more serious since in consequence of this presentation, the
   passions and desires toward the sinful are, considered by themselves,
   sinless, just as Rome teaches it.

   So we read on page 73:

   "Das der Mensch Begierden hat, dass ihn Leidenschaften (pi alpha w/
   tonos theta eta) treiben, wie Zorn, Furcht, Muth, Eifersucht, Freude,
   Liebe, Hass, Sehnsucht, Mitleid, dies Alles constituirt noch keine
   SÃ¼nde, denn das VermÃ¶gen, um Zorn, Unlust, oder Mitleid and dergl. m.
   zu empfinden, ist von Gott geschaffen. Ohne dem wÃ¤re kein Leben und
   keine Bewegung im Menschen. Also die Begierde and Ã¼berhaupt die
   Leidenschaften sind an sich nicht SÃ¼nde. Sie werden es und sind es im
   actuellen Zustand des Menschen, weil durch ein dazwischentretendes
   Gebot and durch jene verkehrte Lebensrichtung, die Paulus einen nomos
   tes amartias nennt, das menschliche Ich bewogen wird, zu den
   Leidenschaften und Begierden Stellung zu nehmen, d. h. sich richtig
   oder unrichtig zu ihnen zu verhalten." [22]

   Let each judge for himself whether we said too much when we spoke of
   the necessity of protesting, in the name of our Reformed Confession,
   against the creeping in of this Platonic presentation, which later on
   was defended partly by the Romish, partly by the Lutheran theologians.

   Dr. BÃ¶hl is excellent when he shows that the original righteousness was
   not simply a germ, which had still to be developed, but that Adam's
   righteousness was complete, lacking nothing. Equally excellent is his
   proof against Rome, showing that man, in his naked nature, absolutely
   lacks the power to holiness. But he errs in representing the image of
   God as something without which man remains man. This places
   righteousness and holiness mechanically outside of us, while the
   organic connection between that image and our own being, which once
   existed and ought to exist, is the very thing that must be maintained.

   And yet, let it not be thought that Dr. BÃ¶hl has any inclination toward
   Rome. If we see aright, his deviation, psychologically explained,
   springs from an entirely different motive.

   It is a well-known fact that Dr. KÃ¶hlbrugge has contended, with a
   glorious ardor of faith, against the reestablishing of the Covenant of
   Works in the midst of the Covenant of Grace: and has reintroduced us
   with stress and emphasis to the completely finished work of our Savior,
   to which nothing can be added. Hence this preacher of righteousness was
   compelled to make the child of God remember what he was outside of
   Christ. Of course, outside of Christ, there is no difference between a
   child of God and a godless person. Then all lie in one heap; as the
   ritual of the Lord's Supper so beautifully confesses: "That we seek our
   life out of ourselves, in Jesus Christ, and thereby acknowledge that we
   lie in the midst of death''; as also the Heidelberg Catechism
   confesses: "That I have grossly transgressed all the commandments of
   God, and kept none of them, and am still inclined to all evil."

   If we see aright, Dr. BÃ¶hl has tried to reduce this part of the truth
   to a dogmatic system. He has reasoned it out as follows: "If a child of
   God has his life outside of himself, then Adam, who was a child of God,
   must also have had his life outside of himself. Hence the image of God
   was not in, but outside of, man."

   And what is the mistake of this reasoning? This, that the child of God
   remains a sinner until his death, and is only fully restored after his
   death. Then only complete redemption is his. While in Adam, before his
   fall, there was no sin; hence Adam could never say that in himself he
   lay in the midst of death.

   With all the earnestness of our hearts we beseech all those who with us
   possess the treasure of Dr. KÃ¶hlbrugge's preaching carefully to notice
   this deviation. If the younger Kohlbruggians should be tempted to
   misunderstand their teacher in this respect, the loss would be
   incalculable, and the breach in the Reformed Confession would be
   lasting; since it touches a point which affects the whole confession of
   the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] "God ordered it so that immediately, from the beginning, man came
   to stand under the influence of that which is good, and consequently
   did that which is good. He created him in the image of God, after His
   likeness. The significance of this is made clear when we consider the
   restoration of fallen man (according to Ephes. iv. 24; Col. iii. 9).
   Paul, speaking of the new man that we must put on, after having put off
   the old man, has reference to the original state. And now he describes
   this new man as one that is created after God in righteousness and
   holiness, as he truly is. These apostolic expressions contain a
   description of the same equipment that Moses characterizes with the
   words: In the image of God, after, His likeness. Regeneration is a new
   creation, which, however, is ordered after the model of the old,
   without taking anything from, or adding anything to it. Hence man's
   standing in the image of God, wherein he was after the likeness of God,
   is something that can be taken away from man without removing God's
   creature itself. Furthermore, the apostle describes the movements of
   the new man under the image of various, garments which must be put on
   (Col. iii. 12 ff.). The ground and occasion of such being clothed upon
   is Christ, the Spirit whom Christ sends from the Father; or the
   standing in Christ, or in grace (e.g. 2 Cor. v. 17; Gal. v. 16, 18, 25;
   Rom. v. 2). And in just the same way is the ground, for likeness with
   God, the standing in the image of God, according to Gen. i. 26."

   [20] "If we now think of the creature to have left this standing, yet
   this creature remains intact."

   [21] "With this understanding, however, that the creature has not
   retained enough strength, with the help of the gracious gift of Christ,
   to restore himself, as Rome teaches. But after the fall, man's ego,
   with the highest gifts received in his creation, has left his true
   standing and is delivered to Death as his ruler, and to the Law as his
   unmerciful driver."

   [22] "The fact that man has desires, that he is led by passions, such
   as anger, fear, courage, jealousy, joy, love, hate, longing, pity; all
   this does not constitute sin; for the power to experience anger,
   displeasure, or pity, and the like passions, is created of God. Without
   these there would be no life nor stir in man. Hence desires and
   passions in general are no sin in themselves. They become and are sin
   in man's present condition, because, by an intervening law, and by that
   perverted tendency of life which Paul calls a law of sin, the human Ego
   is compelled to determine its relation to the passions and desires,
   i.e., to adopt a good or bad attitude toward them."

  After the Scripture.

   "In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God created He
   him."--Gen. v. 1.

   In the preceding pages we have shown that the translation, "in Our
   image," actually means, "after Our image." To make anything in an image
   is no language; it is unthinkable, logically untrue. We now proceed to
   show how it should be translated, and give our reason for it.

   We begin with citing some passages from the Old Testament in which
   occurs the preposition "B" which, in Gen. i. 27, stands before image,
   where it can not be translated "in," but requires a preposition of
   comparison such as "like" or "after."

   Isa. xlviii. 10 reads: "Behold I have refined thee, but not with
   silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction." Here the
   preposition "B "stands before silver, as in Gen. i. 27 before image. It
   is obvious that it can not be translated "in silver," but "as silver."
   Surely the Lord would not cast the Jews in a pot of melted silver. The
   preposition is one of comparison; as in 1 Peter i. 17 the refining of
   Israel is compared to that of a noble metal. It may be translated: "I
   have refined thee, but not according to the nature of silver", or
   simply: "as silver."

   Psalm cii. reads: "My days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are
   burned as an hearth." In the Hebrew the same preposition "B" occurs
   before smoke, and almost all exegetes translate it, "as smoke."

   Again, Psalm xxxv. 2 reads: "Take hold of shield and buckler and stand
   up for mine help." "Stand up in my help" makes no sense. The thought
   allows no other translation than this: "Stand up so that Thou be my
   help;" or, "Stand up as my help"; or, as the Authorized Version has it:
   "Stand up for my help."

   We find the same result in Lev. xvii. 11 : "The life of the flesh is in
   the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an
   atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh an atonement
   for the soul. Here the same preposition "B" occurs. In the Hebrew it
   reads: "Banefesh" (Heb. Shin dot Pe segol Nun segol Bet patah dagesh),
   which was translated "for the soul." It would be absurd to render it:
   "in the soul"; for the blood does not come in the soul, nor does the
   atonement take place in the soul, but on the altar. Here we have also a
   comparison (substitution). The blood is as the soul, represents the
   soul in the atonement, takes the place of the soul.

   We notice the same in Prov. iii. 26, where the wisdom of Solomon wrote:
   "The Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being
   taken." The same preposition occurs here. The Hebrew text reads
   "Bkisleka" (Heb. Dalet hataf qamats Lamed segol Samekh sheva Kaf hiriq
   Bet dagesh sheva), literally, "for a' loin to thee." And because the
   loins are a man's strength, it is used metaphorically to indicate the
   ground of confidence and hope in distress. The sense is therefore
   perfectly clear. Says Solomon: "The Lord shall be to thee as a ground
   of confidence, thy refuge, and thy hope." For if we should read here:
   "The Lord shall be in your hope," it might be inferred that, among
   other things, the Lord was also in the hope of the godly; which would
   be unscriptural and savor of Pelagianism. In the Scripture, the Lord
   alone is the hope of His people. Hence the preposition does not mean,
   "in," but it indicates a comparison.

   To add one more example, Exod. xviii. 4 reads: "The God of my father
   was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh." Translate
   this, "The God of my father was in my help," and how unscriptural and
   illogical the thought!

   From these passages, to which others might be added, it appears:

   (1) That this preposition can not always be translated by "in."

   (2) That its use as a preposition of comparison, in the sense of
   "like," "for," "after," is far from being rare.

   Armed with this information, let us now return to Gen. i. 26; and in
   our opinion, it does not offer us now any difficulty at all. As in Isa.
   xlviii. 10, the preposition and noun are translated "as silver"; in
   Psalm cii. 4, "as smoke"; in Psalm xxxv. 2, "as" or "to my help"; in
   Lev. xvii. 11, "as" or "in the place of my soul"; in Prov. iii. 16,
   "as," or "to my confidence," the German Version of the Vienna Hebrew
   Bible translates, "Let Us make men to, or as Our image," i.e., let Us
   make men, who shall be Our image on the earth. Or more freely: "Let Us
   make a sort of being who will bear Our image on earth, who will be as
   Our image on earth, or be to Us on earth for an image."

   Then it follows, in Gen. i. 27: "And God created man for His image, to
   be an image of God created He him."

   It is, of course, exactly the same whether I say, "God created man
   after His image," i.e., so that man became bearer of His image, or "God
   created man for an image of Himself." In both instances, and in similar
   manner, it is expressed that man should exhibit an image of God. Thus
   far the image of God was lacking in the earth. When God had created
   man, the lack was supplied: for that image was man, upon whose being
   the Lord God had stamped His own image. Hence we see no difference in
   the two translations.

   Speaking of the image stamped on sealing-wax by a seal, I can say, "I
   have stamped the wax after the image of the seal," referring to the
   concave image of the seal; or, "The image is stamped on the wax,"
   referring to the convex image on the wax.

   We add three remarks:

   First, the word "man" in Gen. i. 26 does not refer to one person, but
   to the whole race. Adam was not merely a person, but our progenitor and
   federal head. The whole race was in his loins. Humanity consists at any
   given moment of the aggregate of those who live or will live in this
   world, whether many or few. Adam alone was humanity; when Eve was given
   him he and she were humanity. "Let Us make man in Our image and after
   Our likeness," is equal to: "Let Us create humanity, which will bear
   Our image." But it refers also to the individual in that he is a member
   of the human family. Hence Adam begat children in his image and after
   his own likeness. Yet there is a difference. Men have different gifts,
   talents, and qualifications; the complete impress of the divine image
   could appear not in individual endowments, but in the full
   manifestation of the race, if it had remained sinless.

   Hence the Dutch Version uses the plural, altho the Hebrew the singular
   "man": not Adam alone, but the genus man, humanity, was created in the
   divine image.

   Hence when the original man fell, the second Adam came in Christ, who,
   as the second federal Head, contained in Himself the whole Church of
   God. In His meditorial capacity Christ appeared as God's image in
   Adam's place. Wherefore every member of the Church must be transformed
   after His image--1 Cor. xv. 49; Rom. viii. 29. And the Church,
   representing regenerated humanity, is the pleroma of the Lord; for it
   is called "the fulness of Him that filleth all in all."

   Secondly, since man is created to be God's image on earth, he must be
   willing to remain image, and never presume or imagine to be original.
   Original and image are opposites. God is God, and man is not God, but
   only the image of God. Hence it is the essence of sin when man refuses
   to remain image, reflection, shadow, exalting himself to be something
   real in himself. Conversion depends, therefore, solely upon his
   willingness to become image again, i.e., to believe. He that becomes an
   image is nothing in himself, and exhibits all that he is in absolute
   dependence upon Him whose image he bears; and this is at once man's
   highest honor and completest dependence.

   Lastly, God must have His image in the earth. For this purpose He
   created Adam. Having defiled it beyond recognition, man denies the
   existence of the divine image in the earth. And thus image-worship
   originated. Image-worship means that man says: "I will undertake to
   make an image of God." And this diametrically opposes God's work. It is
   His holy prerogative to make an image of Himself; and the creature
   should never dare undertake it. Hence it is presumption when, aspiring
   to be God, man refuses to remain His image, defiles it in himself, and
   undertakes to represent God in gold or silver.

   Image-worship is an awful sin. God saith: "Thou shalt not make unto
   thee any graven image." (Exod. xx. 4) This sin is from Satan. He always
   imitates God's work. He will not be less than God. When at last the
   Great Beast appears, the Dragon proclaims: "They that dwell in the
   earth should make an image of the Beast!" God has decreed to make His
   own image to be the object of His eternal pleasure. But Satan, opposing
   this, defiles that image and makes an image for himself; not of man,
   for he is defiled and ruined, but of a beast. And thus in his supreme
   manifestation he judges himself. God's Son became a man, Satan's
   creation is a beast.

   When finally the Beast and its image are overthrown, by One who is like
   a son of man, it is the Lord's triumph over His enemies. Then the
   divine image is restored, nevermore to be defiled. And the Almighty God
   rejoices forever and ever in His own reflection.

  IX.

  The Image of God in Man.

   "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image
   of the heavenly."--1 Cor. xv. 49.

   One more point remains to be discussed, viz., whether the divine image
   refers to the image of Christ.

   This singular opinion has found many warm defenders in the Church from
   the beginning. It originated with Origen, who with his brilliant,
   fascinating, and seducing heresies has unsettled many things in the
   Church; and his heresy in this respect has found many defenders both
   East and West. Even Tertullian and Ambrose supported it, as well as
   Basil and Chrysostom; and it took no less a person than Augustine to
   uproot it.

   Our Reformed theologians, closely following Augustine, have strongly
   opposed it. Junius, Zanchius and Calvin, Voetius and Coccejus condemned
   it as error. We can safely say that in our Reformed inheritance this
   error never had a place. .

   But in the last century it has crept again into the Church. The
   pantheistic philosophy occasioned it; and its after-effects have
   tempted our German and Dutch mediation theologians to return to this
   ancient error.

   The great philosophers who enthralled the minds of men at the beginning
   of this century fell in love with the idea that God became man. They
   taught not that the Word became flesh, but God became man; and that in
   the fatal sense that God is ever becoming, and that He becomes a better
   and a purer God as He becomes more purely man. This pernicious system,
   which subverts the foundations of the Christian faith, and under a
   Christian form annihilates essential Christianity, has led to the
   doctrine that in Christ Jesus this incarnation had become a fact; and
   from it was deduced that God would have become man even if man had not
   sinned.

   We have often spoken of the danger of teaching this doctrine. The
   Scripture repudiates it, teaching that Christ is a Redeemer from and an
   atonement for sin. But a mere passing contradiction will not stop this
   evil; this poisonous thread, running through the warp and woof of the
   Ethical theology, will not be pulled from the preaching until the
   conviction prevails that it is philosophic and pantheistic, leading
   away from the simplicity of Scripture.

   But for the present nothing can be done. Almost all the German manuals
   now used by our rising ministers feed this error; hence the widespread
   prevalence of the idea that the image in which man was created was the
   Christ.

   And this is natural. So long as it is maintained that, even without
   sin, man was destined for Christ and Christ for man, it must follow
   that the original man was calculated for Christ, and hence was created
   after the image of Christ.

   For evidence that this deviates from the truth, we refer theologians to
   the writings of Augustine, Calvin, and Voetius on this point, and to
   our lay-readers we offer a short explanation why we and all Reformed
   churches reject this interpretation.

   We begin with referring to the many passages in Scripture, teaching
   that the redeemed sinner must be renewed and transformed after the
   image of Christ.

   In 2 Cor. iii. 18 we read: "We all are changed into the same image from
   glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord"; and in Rom. viii.
   29: "That we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of His
   Son"; and in I Cor. xv. 49: "As we have borne the image of the earthy,
   we shall also bear the image of the heavenly." To this category belong
   all such passages in which the Holy Spirit admonishes us to conform
   ourselves to the example of Jesus, which may not be understood as mere
   imitation, but which decidedly means a transformation into His image.
   And lastly, here belong those passages that teach that we must increase
   to a perfect man, "to the stature of the fulness of Christ"; and that
   "we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."

   Hence believers are called to transform themselves after Christ's
   image, which is the final aim of their redemption. But this image is
   not the Eternal Word, the Second Person in the Trinity, but the
   Messiah, the Incarnate Word. 1 Cor. xv. 44 furnishes the undeniable
   proof. St. Paul declares there that the first man Adam was of the earth
   earthy; i.e., not only after the fall, but by creation. Then he says
   that as believers have borne the image of the earthy, so they will also
   bear the image of the heavenly, i.e., Christ. This shows clearly that
   in his original state man did not possess the image of Christ, but that
   afterward he will possess it. What Adam received in creation is clearly
   distinguished from what a redeemed sinner possesses in Christ;
   distinguished in this particular, that it was not according to his
   nature to be formed after Christ's image, which image he could receive
   only by grace after the fall.

   This is evident also from what St. Paul teaches in--1 Cor. xi In the
   third verse, speaking of the various degrees of ascending glory, he
   says that the man is the head of the woman, and the head of every man
   is Christ, and the head of Christ is God. And yet, having spoken of
   these four, woman, man, Christ, God, he says emphatically, in ver. 7,
   not as might be expected, "The woman is the glory of the man, the man
   the glory of Christ," but, omitting the link Christ, he writes: "For
   the man is the glory of God, and the woman the glory of the man." If
   this theory under consideration were correct, he should have said: "The
   man is the image of Christ."

   Hence it is plain that according to Scripture the image after which we
   are to be renewed is not that after which we are created; the two must
   be distinguished. The latter is that of the Triune God whose image
   penetrated into the being of the race. The former is that of the holy
   and perfect Man Christ Jesus, our federal Head, and as such the Example
   [Dutch, Voorbeeld; literally, an image placed before one.--Trans.],
   after which every child of God is to be renewed, and which at last he
   shall resemble.

   Hence Scripture offers two different representations: first, the Son
   who is the image of the Father as the Second Person in the Trinity;
   second, the Mediator our Example [Voorbeeld, image put before one],
   hence our image after which we are to be renewed; and between the two
   there is almost no connection. The Scripture teaching that the Son of
   God is the express image of His Person and the image of the Invisible,
   refers to the relation between the Father and the Son in the hidden
   mystery of the Divine Being. But speaking of our calling to be renewed
   after the image of Christ, it refers to the Incarnate Word, our Savior,
   tempted like as we are in all things, yet without sin.

   Mere similarity of sound should not lead us to make this mistake. Every
   effort to translate Gen. i. 26, "Let Us make man in or after the image
   of the Son," is confusing. Then "Let Us" must refer to the Father
   speaking to the Holy Spirit; and this can not be. Scripture never
   places the Father and the Holy Spirit in such relation. Moreover, it
   would put the Son outside the greatest act of creation, viz., the
   creation of man. And Scripture says: "Without Him was not anything made
   that was made" (John i. 3); and again: "Through Him are created all
   things in heaven and on earth."

   Hence this "Let Us" must be taken either as a plural of majesty, of
   which the Hebrew has not a single instance in the first person; or as
   spoken by the Triune God, the Three Persons mutually addressing each
   other; or the Father addressing the two other Persons. A third is
   impossible.

   Supposing that the Three Persons address each other; the image can not
   refer to the Son, because, speaking of His own, He can not say, "Our
   image," without including the other Persons. Or suppose that the Father
   speaks to the Son and to the Holy Spirit; even then it can not refer to
   the image of the Son, since He is the Father's image and not that of
   the Holy Spirit. In whatever sense it be taken, this view is untenable,
   outside the analogy of Scripture, and inconsistent with the correct
   interpretation of Gen. i. 26.

   To put it comprehensively: If the divine image refers to the Christ, it
   must be that of the Eternal Son, or of the Mediator, or of Christ in
   the flesh. These three are equally impossible. First, the Son is
   Himself engaged in the creative work. Second, without sin there is no
   need of a Mediator. Third, Scripture teaches that the Son became flesh
   after our image, but never that in the creation we became flesh after
   His image.

   The notion that the divine image refers to Christ's righteousness and
   holiness, implying that Adam was created in extraneous righteousness,
   confounds the righteousness of Christ which we embrace by faith and
   which did not exist when Adam was created, and the original, eternal
   righteousness of God the Son. It is true that David embraced the
   imputed righteousness, altho it existed not in his day, but David was a
   sinner and Adam before the fall was not. He was created without sin;
   hence the divine image can not refer to the righteousness of Christ,
   revealed only in relation to sin.

   In our present sad condition, we confess unconditionally that even now
   we lie in the midst of death, and have our life outside of ourselves in
   Christ alone. But we add: Blessed be God, it shall not always be so.
   With our last breath we die wholly to sin, and in the resurrection
   morning we shall be like Him; hence in the eternal felicity our life
   shall be no more without us, but in us.

   Wherefore, to put the separation which was caused only by sin, and
   which in the saint continues only on account of sin, in Adam before the
   fall, is nothing else than to carry something sinful into Creation
   itself, and to annihilate the divine statement that man was created
   good.

   Wherefore we admonish preachers of the truth to return to the old,
   tried paths in this respect, and teach in recitation-hall, pulpit, and
   catechetical class that man was created after the image of the Triune
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  X.

  Adam Not Innocent, but Holy.

   "Created in righteousness and true holiness."--Ephes. iv. 24.

   It remains, therefore, as of old, that "God created man good and after
   His own image, that is, in true righteousness and holiness, that he
   might rightly know God his Creator, heartily love Him, and live with
   Him in eternal happiness, and glorify and praise Him." Or, as the
   Confession of Faith has it: "We believe that God created man, out of
   the dust of the earth, and made him and formed him after His own image
   and likeness, good and righteous and wholly capable in all things to
   will, agreeably to the will of God."

   Every representation which depreciates in the least this original
   righteousness must be opposed.

   Adam's righteousness lacked nothing. The idea that he was holy inasmuch
   as he had not sinned, and by constant development could increase his
   holiness, so that if he had not fallen he would have attained a still
   holier state, is incorrect, and betrays ignorance in this respect.

   The difference between man in his original state and in the state of
   sin is similar to that between a healthy child and a sick man. Both
   must increase in strength. If the child remains what he is, he is not
   healthy. Health includes growth and increase of strength and
   development until maturity be attained. The same is true of the sick
   man; he can not remain the same. He must recover or grow worse. If he
   is to recover, he must gain in strength. So far both are the same.

   But here the similarity ceases. Increase the strength of the sick at
   once, and he will be well, and what he should be. But add the full
   strength of the man to the child, and he will be unnatural and
   abnormal. For the present the child needs no more than he has. He lacks
   nothing at any given moment. To be a normal child in perfect health, he
   must be just what he is. But the sick person needs a great deal. In
   order to be healthy and normal he must not be what he is. The child, so
   far as health and strength are concerned, is perfect; but the sick
   person is very imperfect as regards health and strength. The condition
   of the child is good; that of the sick man is not good. And the
   former's healthy growth is something entirely different from the
   latter's improvement in health and strength.

   This shows how wrong it is to apply sanctification to Adam before the
   fall. Sanctification is inconceivable with reference to sinless man;
   foreign to the conception of a creature whom God calls good.

   "Excellent," says one; hence Adam was born in childlike innocence
   gradually to attain a higher moral development without sin; hence
   sanctification after all!

   Certainly not. A believer's sanctification ceases when he dies. In
   death he dies to all sin. Sanctification is merely the process which
   partly or wholly eliminates sin from man. Wholly freed from sin he is
   holy, and it is impossible to make him holier than holy. Even for this
   reason it is absurd to apply sanctification to holy Adam. What need of
   washing that which is clean? Sanctification presupposes unholiness, and
   Adam was not unholy. Sin being absolutely absent, holiness lacks
   nothing, but is complete. Adam possessed the same complete holiness now
   possessed by the child of God in which he stands by faith, and by and
   by in actuality when through death he has absolutely died unto sin.

   Yet in heaven God's children will not stand still--their joy and glory
   will ever increase, but not their holiness, which lacks nothing. And to
   be more holy than perfectly holy is impossible. Their development will
   consist in drinking ever more copiously from the life of God.

   The same is true of sinless Adam; he could not be sanctified.
   Sanctification is healing, and a healthy person can not be healed.
   Sanctification is to rid one of poison, but poison can not be drawn
   from the hand that is not bitten. The idea of holy, holier, holiest is
   absurd. That which is broken is not whole, and that which is whole is
   not broken. Sanctification is to make whole, and since in Adam nothing
   was broken, there was nothing to be made whole. More whole than whole
   is unthinkable.

   Yet altho holy, Adam did not remain what he was, he did not stand still
   without an aim in life. Take, e.g., the difference between him and
   God's child. The latter possesses an unlosable treasure, but Adam's was
   losable, for he lost it. Not that he was less holy than the saint; for
   this has nothing to do with it.

   Let us illustrate. Of two dishes, one is fine cut glass, hence
   breakable; the other coarse glass, but unbreakable. Is the latter now
   more whole than the former? Or can the former be made more whole? Of
   course not; its wholeness has nothing to do with its being breakable or
   not. Hence the fact that Adam's treasure was losable does not touch the
   question of holiness at all. Whether one is holy, or yet to be made
   holy, does not depend upon the losableness of the treasure, but upon
   its being lost or not.

   How this holy development of Adam was to be effected we do not know. We
   may not inquire after things God has kept from us. As sinners we can no
   more conceive of such sinless development than of the unfolding of the
   heavenly glory of God's children.

   Confining ourselves closely to Scripture, we know, first, that sinless
   man would not have died; second, that as a reward for his work he would
   have received eternal life, i.e., being perfectly able from moment to
   moment to do God's will, he would always have desired and loved to do
   it; and for this he would have been rewarded continually with larger
   measures of the life and glory of God.

   We compare the contrast between Adam's condition and ours to that
   between the royal child born possessor of vast treasures, and a child
   of poverty that must earn everything or have another to earn it for
   him. The former lacks nothing, altho he has only toys to dispose of;
   for his father's whole estate is his. Growing up, he does not become
   richer, for his treasures remain the same; but he becomes more
   conscious of them. So Adam's treasures would never have increased, for
   all things were his; only as his life gradually unfolded would he have
   had more conscious enjoyment of his riches.

   Hence original righteousness does not refer to Adam's degree of
   development, nor to his condition, but to his state; and that was
   perfectly good.

   All those unscriptural notions of Adam's increase in holiness spring
   from the unscriptural ideas which men, tempted by pantheistic heresies,
   have formed of holiness.

   "Be ye then perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,"
   does not mean that you, boastful man, puffed up by philosophic madness,
   must become like God. A creature you will remain even in your highest
   glory. And in that glory the consciousness that you are nothing and God
   is all will be cause of your most fervent adoration and deepest
   delight. No, Christ's word simply means, "Be whole," even as your
   Father in heaven is whole and complete. Saying that an earthen vessel
   must be as whole and sound as a porcelain vase does not mean that it
   must become like that vase. The former costs but a few cents; the
   latter is paid for with gold. It only means that as the vase is whole
   as a vase, so must the earthen vessel be whole as an earthen vessel.

   Hence Christ's word means: There are rents in your being; the edges are
   chipped; you are injured and damaged by sin. This must not be so. There
   may be no break in your being, nor should defect mar your completeness.
   Behold, as your Father in heaven is unbroken, so must you be wholly
   sound, unbroken, and perfect. That is, as God remained perfect as God,
   so must you remain whole and complete as man, a creature in the hand of
   your Creator.

   But generally it is not so understood. The current view is as follows:
   The first step in holiness is conflict with sin. Second, sin becomes
   weak. Third, sin is almost overcome. Fourth, sin is entirely cast out.
   Then only, the higher sanctification sets in, and the whole ladder is
   being climbed; higher and higher, ever more holy, until holiness
   reaches the clouds.

   Of course, those who accept these fancies can not think of Adam
   otherwise than as created on a low plane of holiness and called to
   attain higher sanctification. But if there is but one sanctification,
   i.e., dying to sin and making the broken nature whole, then higher
   sanctification regarding Adam is out of the question. To Adam's
   holiness nothing can be added. He would have known his Creator,
   heartily loved Him; and lived with Him in eternal happiness to glorify
   and praise Him, in ever-increasing consciousness; but all this would
   not have added anything to his righteousness and holiness. To suppose
   this would betray a lack of understanding concerning holiness. Thus
   love is confounded with holiness; righteousness with life; state with
   condition; word with being; and the very foundations are wrenched from
   their place.

   Yea, worse. Souls are severed from Jesus. For he that fails to
   understand original righteousness can not understand how Christ is
   given us of God for righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. He
   desires Jesus most assuredly. But how? "Jesus finds the sinner sick and
   perishing by the wayside. He puts him on His animal, and takes him to
   the inn, where He pays for him until he is restored." Hence always the
   same representation as tho, after being redeemed, one must still seek
   for a righteousness and holiness which by constant progress will only
   gradually be attained.

   If this is correct then Christ is not our righteousness,
   sanctification, nor redemption; at the most, He is a Friend supporting
   and strengthening us in our efforts to attain righteousness and
   holiness. No; if the Church is to glory once more in the comforting and
   blessed confession that in Christ it possesses now absolute
   righteousness, holiness, and redemption, it must first begin by
   understanding original righteousness, i.e., that Adam can not love, can
   not live in blessed fellowship with God, except he be first perfectly
   righteous and completely holy.

  Sin Not Material.

   "Sin is lawlessness."
   --1 John iii. 4 (R. V.).

   What did sin blunt, corrupt, and destroy in God's image-bearer Adam?

   Altho we can touch this question but lightly, yet it may not be
   slighted. It is evident that, for the right understanding of the
   Spirit's work regenerating and restoring the sinner, the knowledge of
   his condition is absolutely necessary. The mend must fit the rend. The
   wall must be rebuilt where the breach is made. The healing balm must
   suit the nature of the wound. As the disease is, so must also be the
   cure. Or stronger still, as is the death so must be the resurrection.
   The fall and the rising again are interdependent.

   Generalities are useless in this respect. Ministers who seek to uncover
   and expose the man of sin by simply saying that men are wholly lost,
   dead in trespasses and sin, lack the cutting force which alone can lay
   open the putrefying sores of the heart. These serious matters have been
   treated too lightly. Hence by ignoring general and shallow statements
   we simply return to the tried and proven ways of the fathers.

   We begin with pointing to one of the principal errors of the present
   time, viz., that of a resuscitated Manicheism.

   It would be very interesting to present in a condensed form this
   sparkling and fascinating heresy to the Church of to-day. The immediate
   effect would be the discovery of the origin or the family likeness of
   much pernicious teaching that is brought into the Church under a
   Christian name, and by believing men. But this is impossible. We
   confine ourselves to a few features.

   The mission of divine truth in this world is not to wanton with its
   wisdom, but to expose it as a lie. Divine Wisdom does not compromise
   with the speculations and delusions of worldly wisdom, but calls them
   folly and demands their surrender. In the Kingdom of truth, light and
   darkness are pronounced opposites. Hence the Church, in coming in
   contact with the learning and philosophy of the Gentile world, came
   into direct and open conflict with it.

   Compared to Israel, the heathen world was wonderfully wise, learned,
   and scientific; and from her scientific standpoint, she looked down
   with deep contempt and infinite condescension upon the foolishness of
   Christianity. That foolish, ignorant, and unlettered Christianity was
   not only false, but beneath their notice, unworthy to be discussed. In
   Athens the good-natured people had for these unthinking men and their
   absurd babbling a Homeric smile, and the sinister ridiculed them with
   bitter satire. But neither the one nor the other ever seriously
   considered the matter, for it was unscientific.

   And yet, after all, that stupid Christianity carried the day. It made
   progress. It obtained influence, even power. At last the great minds
   and geniuses of those days began to feel attracted to it; until, after
   a conflict of nearly a century, the hour came when the heathen world
   was compelled to come down from its proud self-conceit, and acknowledge
   that ignorant, unlettered, and unscientific Christianity. The lively
   preaching of these Nazarenes had drowned the disputations of those dry
   philosophers. Soon the stream of the world's life passed by their
   schools, and flowed into the channel of the wonderful and inexplicable
   Jesus. Even before the Church was two centuries old, proud heathendom
   discovered that, mortally wounded, its life was in jeopardy.

   Then under the appearance of honoring Christianity, with cunning
   craftiness Satan vitally injured it, injecting poison into its heart.
   In the second century three learned and complicated systems, viz.,
   Gnosticism, Manicheism, and Neo-Platonism, tried with one gigantic
   effort to smother it in the mortal embrace of their heathen
   philosophies.

   When the cross was planted on Calvary, two empires existed in
   heathendom: one in the West, containing Rome and Greece, and the other
   in the East, with its centers in Babylon and Egypt. In each of these
   centers, Babylon and Athens, there were men of rare mental powers,
   comprehensive learning, and profound wisdom. Both centers were swayed
   by a worldly and heathen philosophy; altho its character in both was
   different. And from these centers the effort proceeded to drown
   Christianity in the waters of their philosophy. Neo-Platonism tried to
   accomplish this in the West; Manicheism in the East; and Gnosticism in
   the center.

   Manes was the man who conceived that magnificent, fascinating, and
   seducing system which bears his name. He was a profound thinker, and
   died about the year 270. He was a genial, pious, and seriously minded
   man; he confessed Christ. It was even the aim and object of his zeal to
   extend the Lord's Kingdom. But one thing annoyed him: the endless
   conflict between Christianity and his own science and philosophy. He
   thought there were points of agreement and contact between the two, and
   their reconciliation was not impossible. To bridge the chasm seemed
   beautiful to him. One might walk to the heathen world, and in its
   brilliant philosophies discover many elements of divine origin; and
   returning to Christianity lead some serious heathens to the cross of
   Christ. The profound glory of the Christian faith filled him with
   enthusiasm; yet he remained almost blind for the inherent falsehood of
   heathen philosophy. And as both lay mingled in his soul, so it was his
   aim to devise a system wherein both should be interwoven, and
   transformed into a brilliant whole.

   It is impossible here to introduce his system, which shows that Manes
   had thought out every deep question of vital importance, and with
   comprehensive eye had measured all the dimensions of his cosmology. All
   that we can do is to show how this system led to false ideas of sin.

   This was caused by his mistaken notion that the word "flesh" refers
   only to the body; while Scripture uses it as referring to sin,
   signifying the whole human nature, which does not love the things that
   are above, but the things of the flesh. Flesh in this sense refers more
   directly to the soul than to the body. The works of the flesh are
   twofold: one class, touching the body, are the sins related to
   fornication and lust; the other, touching the soul, consist of sins
   connected with pride, envy, and hatred. In the sphere of visible things
   it finishes its image with shameless fornication; in the realm of
   invisible things it ends with stiff-necked pride.

   Scripture teaches that sin does not originate in the flesh, but in
   Satan, a being without a body. Corning from him it crept first into
   man's soul, then manifested itself in the body. Hence it is
   unscriptural to oppose "flesh" and "spirit" as "body" and "soul." This
   Manes did; and this is the object of his system in all its features. He
   taught that sin is inherent in matter, in the flesh, in all that is
   tangible and visible. "The soul," he says, "is your friend, but the
   body your enemy. The successful resistance of the excitement of the
   blood and the palate would free you from sin." In his own Eastern
   environment he saw much more carnal sin than spiritual; and deceived by
   this he closed his eyes for the latter, or accounted for it as caused
   by the excitement from evil matter.

   And yet Manes was quite consistent, which, giant-thinker that he was,
   could not be otherwise. He arrived at this singular conclusion,
   essential to his system of inventions, that Satan was not a fallen
   angel, not a spiritual, incorporeal being, but matter itself. Hid in
   matter was a power tempting the soul, and that power was Satan. This
   explains how Manes could offer the Church such a singular and
   anti-scriptural doctrine.

   Manes's system bordered on materialism. The materialist says that our
   thinking is the burning of phosphorus in the brain; and that lust,
   envy, and hatred are the result of a discharge of certain glands in the
   body. Virtue and vice are only the result of chemical processes. In
   order to make a man better, freer, and nobler, we should send him to
   the laboratory of a chemist, rather than to school or church. And if it
   were possible for the chemist to lift the man's skull, and subject his
   cells and nerves to the necessary chemical process, then vice would be
   conquered, and virtue and higher wisdom would effectually sway him.

   In a similar way Manes taught that as an inherent and inseparable power
   sin dwells in the blood and muscles, and is transmitted by them. He
   exhorted to eat certain herbs, as a means to overcome sin. There were,
   so he taught, animals, but chiefly plants, into which had penetrated a
   few redeeming and liberating particles of light from the kingdom of
   light which opposed evil; by eating these herbs the blood would absorb
   these saving particles of light, and thus the power of sin would be
   broken. In fact, the church of Manes was a chemical laboratory, in
   which sin was opposed by material agencies.

   This shows the logical consistency of the system, and the weakness of
   the men who, having adopted the false notion of material sin, try to
   escape from its tight hold upon them. But they can not, for, altho
   discarding the draperies belonging to the system as unsuitable to our
   Western mode of thinking, they adopt his whole line of theories, and
   thus falsify not only the doctrine of sin, but almost every other part
   of the Christian doctrine.

   And yet it is only in the doctrine of inherited sin that this error is
   so conspicuous that it can not escape detection:

   It is argued: By virtue of his birth man is a sinner. Hence every child
   must inherit sin from his parents. And since an infant in the cradle is
   ignorant of spiritual sin, and without spiritual development, the
   inherited sin must hide in his being, transmitted with the blood from
   the parents. And this is pure Manicheism, in that it makes sin to be
   transmitted as a power inherent in matter.

   The Confession of the Reformed churches, speaking of inherited sin,
   says, in article xv.

     "We believe that, through the disobedience of Adam, original sin is
     extended to all mankind; which is a corruption of the whole nature,
     and an hereditary disease, wherewith infants themselves are infected
     even in their mother's womb, and which produceth in man all sorts of
     sin, being in him as a root thereof; and therefore is so vile and
     abominable in the sight of God, that it is sufficient to condemn all
     mankind. Nor is it by any means abolished or done away by baptism;
     since sin always issues forth from this woful source, as water from
     a fountain: notwithstanding it is not imputed to the children of God
     unto condemnation, but by His grace and mercy is forgiven them. Not
     that they should rest securely in sin, but that a sense of this
     corruption should make believers often to sigh, desiring to be
     delivered from the body of this death. Wherefore we reject the error
     of the Pelagians, who assert that sin only proceeds from imitation."

   It is apparent, therefore, that the Reformed churches positively
   acknowledge inherited sin; acknowledge also that the child inherits sin
   from the parents; even calls this sin an infection, which adheres even
   to the unborn child. But--and this is the principal thing--they never
   say that this inherited sin is something material, or is transmitted as
   something material. The word infection is used metaphorically, and
   therefore is not the proper expression for the thing which they wish to
   confess. Sin is not a drop of poison which, like a contagious disease,
   passes from father to child. No; the transmission of sin remains in our
   confession an unexplained mystery, only symbolically expressed.

   But this does not satisfy the spirits of the present day. Hence the new
   school of Manicheists which has arisen among us.

   Entangled in the meshes of this heresy are they who deny the doctrine
   of inherited guilt; who entertain false views of the sacraments,
   holding that in Baptism the poison of sin is at least partly removed
   from the soul, and that in the communion of the Holy Supper the sinful
   flesh absorbs a few particles of the glorified body; and lastly, who
   advocate the ridiculous efforts to banish demoniac influences from
   rooms and vacant lots. All this is foolish, unscriptural, and yet
   defended by believing men in our own land. O Church of Christ, whither
   art thou straying?

  XII.

  Sin Not a Mere Negation.

   "I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my
   mind."--Rom. vii. 23.

   Dr. BÃ¶hl's theory, that sin is a mere loss, default, or lack, is an
   error almost as critical as Manicheism.

   This should not be misunderstood. This theory does not deny that the
   sinner is unholy, nor that he ought to be holy. It says two things: (1)
   that there is no holiness in the sinner; but--and this indicates the
   real character of sin--(2) that there ought to be holiness in him. A
   stone does not hear, nor a book see; yet the one is not deaf, nor the
   other blind. But the man who lost both hearing and seeing is both; for
   to his being as a man both are essential. A chair can not walk; yet it
   is not lame, for it is not expected to walk. But the cripple is lame,
   for walking belongs to his being. A horse is not holy, neither is it a
   sinner. But man is a sinner, for he is unholy, and holiness belongs to
   his being; an unholy man is defective and unnatural. Sin, says St.
   John, "Is unrighteousness," non-conformity to the law, or, literally,
   lawlessness, anomy. Hence sin appears only in beings subject to the
   divine, moral law, and consists in non-conformity to that law.

   Thus far this view presents only clear, pure truth; and every effort to
   give sin positive, independent entity contradicts the Word and leads to
   Manicheism, as may be seen in the otherwise fervent and conscientious
   Moravian Brethren.

   Scripture denies that sin has a positive character implying that it has
   independent being. Independent being is either created or uncreated. If
   uncreated, it must be eternal, and this is God alone. If created, God
   must be its Creator; which can not be, for He is not sin's Author.
   Hence Scripture does not teach that the power of evil inheres in
   matter, but in Satan. And what is Satan? Not an evil substance, but a
   being intended for, and endued with holiness; who abandoned himself to
   unholiness, in which he entangled himself hopelessly, becoming
   absolutely unholy. The doctrine of Satan opposes the false notion that
   sin has entity. The idea that sin is a power, in the sense of a faculty
   exercised by an independent being, is inconsistent with Scripture.

   So far we heartily agree with Dr. BÃ¶hl, and acknowledge that he has
   maintained the old and tried conviction of believers, and the positive
   confession of the Church.

   But from this he infers that, before and after the fall, Adam remained
   the same, with this difference only, that after the fall he lost the
   splendor of righteousness in which he had walked hitherto. So far as
   his powers and being were concerned, he remained the same. And this we
   do not accept. It would make man like a lamp brightly burning but soon
   extinguished, when it became a dark body. Or like a fireplace radiant
   with the glow and heat of fire this moment, cold and dark the next. Or
   like a piece of iron magnetized by the electric current, which gives it
   power to attract; but the current withdrawn it ceases to be a magnet.
   When the light was blown out, the lamp remained uninjured. When the
   fire died, the hearth remained what it was before. And when the
   electric fluid left the iron, it was iron still.

   And so says Dr. BÃ¶hl regarding man. As the current passes through the
   iron and magnetizes it, so did the divine righteousness pass through
   Adam and make him holy. As the lamp shines when lighted by the spark,
   so did Adam shine when touched by the spark of righteousness. And as
   the hearth is aglow with the fire, so was Adam radiant with the
   righteousness created in him. But now sin comes in. That is, the lamp
   goes out, the hearth becomes cold, the magnet is mere iron again. And
   man stands robbed of his splendor, dark and unable to attract. But for
   the rest he remained what he was. Dr. BÃ¶hl says distinctly that man
   remained the same before and after the fall.

   And with this we do not agree. As a sinner he was still man,
   undoubtedly, but man as the fathers confessed at Dordt (3d and 4th,
   Head of Doctrine, art. xvi.): "That man by the fall did not cease to be
   a creature endowed with understanding and will, nor did sin, which
   pervaded the whole race of mankind, deprive him of the human nature,
   but brought upon him depravity and spiritual death." Dr. BÃ¶hl's
   statement, "Wenn wir die Creatur aus jenem Stande hin ausgetreten
   denken, so bleibt diese Creatur intact," [23] directly contradicts this
   pure confession of the Reformed churches.

   No, the creature did not remain intact, but sin so seriously injured
   him that he became corrupt even unto death. And tho we acknowledge that
   sin has no real being in itself, yet with equal decision we confess,
   with our church, that its workings are by no means merely negative, nor
   exclusively privative, but most assuredly very positive.

   Scripture and our best theologians (Rivet, Wallaeus, and Polyander by
   name, in their Synopsis) teach this so positively that it is almost
   unimaginable how Dr. BÃ¶hl could reach any other conclusion. Wherefore
   we are inclined to believe that on this point he agrees with the
   confession of the orthodox churches, but that he represents this matter
   in such a strange manner for the sake of something else and for an
   entirely different reason.

   If we may be frank, we would represent Dr. BÃ¶hl's course of reasoning
   as follows. "My teacher, Dr. KÃ¶hlbrugge, used to oppose strenuously the
   men that proudly say to the unconverted: Touch me not, for I am holier
   than thou. He used to emphasize the fact that the child of God,
   considered for a moment out of Christ, lies in the midst of death, just
   as much as the unconverted. Hence regeneration does not change man in
   the least. Before and after regeneration he is exactly the same, with
   this difference only, that the converted man believes and by his faith
   walks in reflected righteousness. And if this be so, then regarding the
   fall the reverse is true; that is, before and after the fall man as
   such remained the same; the only change was that in the fall he left
   the righteousness in which he stood before."

   Of course we may be mistaken, but we dare surmise that in this Way Dr.
   BÃ¶hl was tempted to this strange representation, and even to declare,
   as Rome teaches, that desire in itself is no sin; something which the
   Reformed Church on the ground of the Tenth Commandment has always
   opposed.

   In fact, the question regarding the fall and the restoration is the
   same. If the restoration does not affect our being, then neither can
   the fall have affected it. If redemption means only that a sinner is
   set in the light of Christ's righteousness, then the fall can mean no
   more than that man stepped out of that light. The two belong together.
   As it was in the fall, so it must be in the restoration. A man's
   confession regarding redemption will, if he be consistent, tell what
   his confession is regarding the fall.

   Hence if Dr. KÃ¶hlbrugge had confessed that the restoration leaves our
   being unchanged and only translates us into a sphere of righteousness,
   then it should be conceded that he also represented the fall as leaving
   man and his nature intact. And this is the very thing which we can not
   concede. Dr. KÃ¶hlbrugge has uncovered the actual corruption of our
   nature so forcibly and positively that we will never believe that
   according to his confession the fall left our being and nature intact.
   Neither can we concede that, according to his confession, in the
   restoration our being is left unchanged, even tho he connected that
   change, very rightly, with the mystic union and with the dying to sin
   in death.

   If he had actually intended to teach what many of his followers allege
   that he did teach, then we would call his tendency very definitely
   erroneous. But since we can not interpret him without taking into
   account the misrepresentations which he so strongly opposed, and
   especially since his confession concerning the corruption of our nature
   was so complete, we maintain that he did not teach what many of his
   followers offer in his name.

   Hence our way is in the very opposite direction. Dr. BÃ¶hl says in other
   words: "Dr. KÃ¶hlbrugge, in his doctrine of redemption, starts from the
   idea that redemption leaves the sinner essentially unchanged; hence
   neither can sin have affected him essentially." While, on the contrary,
   we say: "The confession of KÃ¶hlbrugge regarding the corruption of our
   nature is so complete that he could not but confess that in the fall,
   and therefore in the restoration, our nature was changed."

   But be that as it may, this is sure, that, according to the word and
   the constant doctrine of our Church, sin, altho it is essentially and
   exclusively privative and lacking independent existence, is yet in its
   consequences positive and in its workings destructive.

   Our nature did not remain unchanged, but it became corrupt; and
   corruption is the significant word which indicates the fatal, positive
   effects which resulted from this loss of life and light.

   A plant needs light to flourish; light excluded, it not only
   languishes, but soon withers, decays, and at last mildews; and this is,
   corruption. Cancer and smallpox are not merely loss of health; but have
   a positive action, which destroys the tissues, creates morbid growth,
   and corrupts the body. A corpse is not merely a lifeless body, but the
   seat of dissolution and corruption. In like manner we are conscious
   that sin is not merely the deprivation of holiness, but we feel its
   fearful activity, corruption, and dissolution which destroy. Strongest
   proof is the fact that we do not joyfully welcome God's grace entering
   the heart, but with our whole nature oppose it. There is conflict which
   would be impossible if that deprivation and loss had not developed evil
   which opposes God.

   This corruption does not stop until the body is dissolved into its
   original constituents. We do not know what became of the bodies of
   Moses, Enoch, and Elijah. The Scripture makes exceptions. Christ did
   not see corruption, and believers living at the Lord's return will
   escape bodily dissolution. But all others, millions upon millions, will
   sicken and die; and return to the dust. Physical disease and death are
   types of soul-corruption which mere words fail to express.

   Scripture and experience show clearly that Satan is not merely
   bereaved, emptied, and lacking, but that he causes a positive,
   corrupting activity to proceed from him. And so, tho in less degree,
   the soul has become corrupt; not only in the sense of being dark
   instead of light, chilled instead of warm, but that this deprivation
   has resulted in positive destruction and corruption. Cold is loss of
   heat, which on reaching the freezing-point causes positive injury to
   the body. And such is sin. As to its being, it is loss, deprivation,
   and nakedness. And these cause in body and soul a destructive working
   which affects man's whole nature, binding him with the fetters of
   corruption, altho he ceases not to be man.

   We reconcile sin's privative being with its positive working as
   follows: depriving the ceaseless activity of man's nature of correct
   guidance, it runs in the wrong direction, and wrests and destroys
   itself.

  XIII.

   Sin a Power in Reversed Action.

   "If ye live after the flesh ye shall die."--Rom. viii. 13.

   Altho sin is originally and essentially a loss, a lack, and a
   deprivation, in its working it is a positive evil and a malignant
   power.

   This is shown by the apostolic injunction not only to put on the new
   man, but also to put off the old man with his works. The well-known
   theologian Maccovius, commenting on this, aptly remarks: "This could
   not be enjoined if sin were merely a loss of light and life; for a mere
   lack ceases as soon as it is supplied.

   If sin were merely a loss of righteousness, nothing more would be
   needed than its restoration, and sin would disappear. The putting off
   of the old man, or the laying down of the yoke of sin, etc., would be
   out of the question. The light has only to dispel the soul's darkness,
   and its health will be restored. But experience shows that after we are
   enlightened, and the Holy Spirit has entered our heart, there is still
   a fearful power of evil in us; and this together with the oft-repeated
   command not only to accept the righteousness of God which is by faith,
   but also to put off, to lay aside, to be separate from all that is
   evil, proves sin's positive character and evil power in individuals and
   in society, in spite of its privative character.

   Hence the Church confesses that our nature has become corrupt, which of
   course refers us back to the divine image. Our nature did not
   disappear, nor cease to be our nature, but in its orignal features and
   organs it remained the same; the divine image was not lost, not even
   partly lost, but remained stamped upon every man, and will remain even
   in the place of eternal destruction, simply because he can not divest
   himself of his nature except by annihilation. But this being
   impossible, he must retain it as man and in man's nature. Wherefore
   Scripture teaches long after the fall that the sinner is created after
   the image of God. But concerning the effects of its features in the
   fallen human nature, the very opposite is true: these features have
   totally disappeared; the ruins which remain speak at the most only of
   the glory and beauty which have perished.

   Hence the two meanings of the divine image should no longer be
   confounded. Forasmuch as it lies in our nature it will remain evermore;
   so far as its effects upon the quality, i.e., the condition, of our
   nature are concerned, it is lost. The human nature can be corrupted,
   but not annihilated. It can exist as nature, even tho its former
   attributes be lost, and replaced by opposite workings.

   Our fathers discriminated between our nature's being and its
   well-being. In its being it remained uninjured and unharmed, i.e., it
   is still the real, human nature. But in its condition, i.e., in its
   attributes, workings, and influences, in its well-being it is wholly
   changed, and corrupt. Tho a poisoned insect-sting destroys the sight,
   yet the eye remains. So is the human nature; deprived of its luster,
   checked in its normal activity, internally sore and foul, yet it is the
   human nature.

   But it is corrupted by sin. It is true man has retained the power to
   think, will, and feel, besides many glorious talents and faculties,
   even genius sometimes; but this does not touch the corruption of his
   nature. Its corruption is this, that the life which should be devoted
   to God and animated by Him is devoted with downward tendencies to
   earthly things. And this reversed action has changed the whole organism
   of our being.

   If the divine righteousness were essential to human life, this could
   not be so; but it is not. According to Scripture, death is not
   annihilation. The sinner is dead to God, but in this very death throbs
   and thrills his life to Satan, to sin, and to the world. If the sinner
   had no sinful life, Scripture could never say, "Mortify therefore your
   members which are upon the earth," for it is impossible to mortify that
   which is dead already.

   Let not similarity of sound deceive us. Human life is indestructible.
   When the soul is active in conformity to the divine law, Scripture says
   that the soul lives; if not, it is dead. This death is the wages of
   sin. But for this reason man's nature does not cease to work, to use
   its organs, to exert its influence. This is the life of our members
   which are in the earth--our sinful life, the inward festering of evil
   in our corrupt nature; for this reason it must be mortified. Hence
   since sin does not stop our nature from breathing, working, feeding,
   but it causes these activities, which under the sway of the divine law
   did run well and were full of blessing, to go wrong and be corrupt.

   The mainspring of a watch when detached from its pivot does not stop it
   immediately; but, being uncontrolled, it turns the wheels so rapidly as
   to ruin the mechanism. In some respects human nature resembles that
   watch. God has endowed it with power, life, and activity. Controlled by
   His law it worked well, and in harmony with His will. But sin deprived
   it of that control, and, while these powers and faculties remain, they
   run the wrong way, and destroy the delicate organism. If this condition
   lasted only for a moment, and the sinner were immediately restored to
   his original state, it could not lead to a positive evil. But sin lasts
   a long time; sixty centuries already. Its pernicious influence has its
   effects; a secondary disease after the primary; accumulations of sinful
   dregs, and increase of festering sores. The threads of our nature's
   woof pull awry. Everything wrenches itself out of joint. And, since
   this secondary activity continues unchecked, its pernicious working
   becomes more and more critical.

   What causes a felon? A sliver in the finger slightly checks the
   circulation. But the blood continues to circulate, trying to overcome
   the obstacle. The additional pressure against the walls of the
   capillaries produces more friction, and raises the temperature. The
   surrounding tissue swells, the delicate blood-vessels contract, the
   friction increases, and the boil throbs. Altho this is but the
   continued normal action of the circulation, yet it causes positive
   evil. There is a local congestion; poisonous matter inflames the
   healthy tissue, and the parts are thoroughly diseased.

   And such is sin's course. The action of our powers continues, but in
   the wrong direction. This causes disorder, and irregularities, which
   inflame our nature toward evil. This sinful inflammation creates
   unnatural and wicked deformations, which excite the tissues of the soul
   to a morbid growth, compared by Scripture to foul matter. And from this
   unholy marsh poisonous gases rise continually throughout our entire
   nature. Thus the whole economy is disordered. Having run away from the
   divine law without discipline, body and soul become unruly. Hence,
   incited by its own inherent action, it involves itself more deeply and
   runs farther away from God. As a train that is derailed destroys itself
   by its very speed, so does man, having left the track of the divine
   law, compass his own ruin by the inherent impetus and working. Nothing
   more is needed. Destruction results necessarily from the very life of
   our nature.

   Hence the sinner is without knowledge, the feelings are perverted, the
   will is paralyzed, the imagination polluted, the desires are impure,
   and all his ways, tendencies, and outgoings are at once evil; not in
   our eyes, perhaps, but because everything fails to meet the demands of
   God, who wills that everything should meet Him at the terminus of the
   road, i.e., to be with Him and in Him, making His glory the final end
   of all things.

   And this makes many things sinful, unrighteous, and wicked that we
   consider fair and beautiful. Not our taste, but God's, decides what is
   right or wrong. He that wishes to know what that taste is, let him
   learn it from the law of God. That law is standard and plummet. But
   whatever the sinner seeks or desires to please God, he will not do
   this; e.g., he may be perfectly willing to hang his coat on the wall
   and do it gracefully, but not on the nail that God has struck in the
   wall of our life; everywhere else, but not there. Thus everything in
   him becomes evil, his entire nature corrupt, incapable of any good,
   inclined to all evil, yea, prone to hate God and his neighbor. The deed
   may not be born, but the very inclination and desire are sin.

   Like the Romish and some Lutheran theologians, Dr. BÃ¶hl denies this. He
   teaches that there was this desire in holy Adam and even in Christ; not
   indulged, but held in with bit and bridle--as tho God had created man
   with this ravenous animal of desire in his heart, while He endowed him
   at the same time with the power to restrain it. To keep this desire in
   constant check would have been man's greatest excellence.

   But this is not according to Scripture. Nothing shows that holy Adam
   had any desire for the things he saw. The possibility of desire was
   created only by the prohibition: "Of the tree of knowledge of good and
   evil thou shalt not eat." (Gen. ii. 16) And even after that we do not
   discover a trace of desire in him. Such eager looking at the fruit was
   not witnessed until Satan had inwardly incited Eve not to eat of the
   fruit, but through it to become like God. This is the first desire
   awakened in man's heart, and that only after his eye was opened to see
   that the tree was good for food and pleasant to the eye.

   In the righteous state Adam was filled with peace, harmony, and divine
   success; without a trace of the anxiety necessarily springing from the
   task of restraining a dangerous monster. And in the heavenly glory it
   will not be an endless desire to restrain desire, but a complete
   deliverance from desire; not the suction of a great deep in our
   bottomless heart, but all its depths filled with the love of God.

   The commandment "Thou shalt not covet" (Exo. 20. 17) is absolute. The
   Lord Jesus was a total stranger to covetousness. He never desired what
   God withheld. In Gethsemane's terrible dÃ©nouement He desired, yet not
   to receive a gift, but to retain His own, i.e., when under the curse
   not to be forsaken of His God.

  Our Guilt. [24]

   "Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
   and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."--Rom. v.
   12.

   Sin and guilt belong together, but may not be confounded or considered
   synonymous, any more than sanctification and righteousness. It is true
   guilt rests upon every sin, and in every sin there is guilt, yet the
   two must be kept distinct. There is a difference between the blaze and
   the blackened spot upon the wall caused by it; long after the blaze is
   out the spot remains. Even so with sin and guilt. Sin's red blaze
   blackens the soul; but long after sin is left behind, the black mark
   upon the soul continues.

   Hence it is of the greatest importance that the difference between the
   two be clearly understood, especially since confounding sin and guilt
   must lead to confounding justification and sanctification, much to the
   injury of the earnestness of the Christian life.

   If there were but one man on earth, he might sin against himself, but
   he could not be in debt to others. And if, in accordance with modern
   theology, there were no living God, but only an idea of good, he might
   sin against the idea of good, and be exceedingly bad, but he could not
   owe God anything.

   Men owe God because He lives, exists, never departs, forever abides;
   and because from moment to moment they must transact business with Him.
   With men we open accounts at will; and the firms in town with which we
   do so we will owe, but those with which we do not deal we will never
   owe. Many apply this to God, under the mistaken notion that if they
   have no dealings with God they can not owe Him anything and have
   nothing to do with Him. To them He is non-existing; how, then, could
   they be in debt to Him?

   But He does exist. It is not left to our choice to have dealings with
   Him or not. No; in all our affairs, at all times and under all
   circumstances, we must deal and do deal with Him. There is no business
   transacted from which He is excluded. In all things whatever we do, He
   is the most interested. In all our dealings and enterprises He is the
   Preferred Creditor and Senior Partner, with whom we must settle the
   final account. We may bury ourselves in Sahara, or go down to the
   bottom of the ocean, but our account with Him never ceases. We can
   never get away from Him. Working with head, heart, or hand, we open an
   account with God; and while we can deceive other partners and withhold
   part of the accounts from them, He is omniscient, He knows the most
   secret items, He keeps account of the smallest fraction, charging it to
   us; and before we have begun our reckoning, He has already finished it
   and laid it before us.

   Considering this, we realize what it is to be debtors to God; for while
   at every moment, under all circumstances, and in all transactions we
   are obliged to pay Him the whole profit, we never do it, at least not
   in full. Hence every act of head, heart, or hand creates an item of
   debt, which we withhold from Him through being either unwilling or
   unable to pay.

   If God were not, or we were not related to Him, we would be sinners,
   but not debtors. If a few years ago the floods at Krakatoa had engulfed
   all Java, as was feared, would it not have canceled all our debts to
   Java firms? Or suppose that the Patriotic Party in China once more came
   into power, and the Emperor decreed to close the empire against all
   nations, so that during a whole lifetime it was impossible to settle
   business with Chinese firms. Would this not cancel all the debts owing
   to China? Hence if God should cease to be or dissolve every tie binding
   us to Him, all our debts would at once be obliterated. But this is
   impossible; the tie that binds us to Him can not be broken. Our debt to
   Him remains; we can not cancel it; and our thinking that we can cancel
   it does not alter the fact.

   God created us for Himself, and that creates our indebtedness to Him.
   If He had simply created us for the pleasure of creating us, as a boy
   blows soap bubbles for his entertainment, and for the rest did not care
   what became of us, there could be no debt. But He did create us for
   Himself, with the absolute charge, in all things, at every moment, and
   under all circumstances, to lay life's gain upon the altar of His name
   and glory. He does not allow us to live three days out of every ten for
   Him, and the rest for ourselves; in fact, He does not release us for a
   single day or moment. He demands the gain of our existence for His
   glory, unconditionally, always and evermore. He planned and created us
   for this. Thus He claims us. Hence, being our Lord and Ruler, He can
   not forego the last farthing of life's gain; and since we never have
   rendered Him, the tribute, we are absolutely His debtors.

   What money is among men, love is to God. He says to you and me and
   every man: "As you thirst for gold, so do I thirst for love. I, your
   God, want your love, your whole heart's love. This is My due. This I
   claim. This debt I can not cancel. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
   with all thy heart, with all thy mind, and with all thy strength." The
   fact that we do not render Him this love, or render it unholily and
   fraudulently, makes us His debtors perpetually.

   We know that this is called the juridical conception, and that in these
   effeminate days men desire to escape from the tension of the right;
   wherefore the ethical conception is lauded to the skies. But this whole
   sentiment springs directly from a lie. This opposition against the
   juridical conception sets God at naught or ignores Him. Even without
   believing in God, one can dream of an ideal of holiness, according to
   the ethical conception, and strive against sin with inward thirst after
   holiness. But with only an ideal to incite him, there can be no room
   for right, no debt to God; for one can not owe an ideal, but only a
   living person. But when I acknowledge the living God, and that always
   and in all things I have to do with Him, then He has righteous claims
   upon me which I have violated, and which must be satisfied. Hence the
   juridical conception comes first.

   The ethical idea is: "I am sick; how can I become well?" The juridical
   idea is: "How can God's violated right be restored?" The latter is
   therefore of primary importance. The Christian must not first consider
   himself, but God. It wounds the very heart of the Reformed confession
   when the pulpit aims at sanctification without zeal for justification.
   Dr. KÃ¶hlbrugge's chief merit lay in this, that for God's sake he
   grieved over this neglect, and with powerful hand stemmed the tide of
   despising God's right, saying to church and individual: "Brethren,
   justification first."

   To say, "Oh, if I were only holy, my indebtedness to God would not much
   trouble me," sounds very nice, but is deeply sinful. God's children
   desire to be holy as the children of vanity, desire riches, honor and
   glory--i.e., it is always a desire for ourselves, our own ego, in
   ourselves to be what we are not. And the Lord God is left out. It is
   the Pelagian regulating his relation to God according to his own
   satisfaction. In fact it is sin, tho gilded, against the first and
   highest commandment.

   Surely the soul's deep longing after holiness is good and right, but
   only after the question is settled; "How can I be restored to my right
   position before God, whose rights I have violated?" If this is our
   chief concern, then and then only do we love the Lord our God more than
   ourselves. Then the prayer for holiness will follow as a matter of
   course; not from the selfish desire to be spiritually enriched, but
   from the soul's deep longing nevermore to violate the divine right.

   This is deep and far-reaching, and many will deem it harsh. Yet we may
   not hold it back. The unmanly and sickly Christianity now vaunted is
   not that of the fathers and of the godly of all ages and of the
   apostles and prophets. The Lord must be First and Highest; instead of
   being honored, His law is dishonored when, in the pursuit of holiness,
   God's right is forgotten. Even among men it is called dishonest when,
   with debts unpaid, a man goes to America only to make his fortune; and
   we would say to him: "Honestly to pay your debts is more honorable than
   merely to be successful. And this applies here. God's child does not
   enter the kingdom with a cry for success, but to balance his accounts
   with God.

   And this explains the difference between sin and guilt. A burglar
   repents and returns the stolen treasure. Is he now entitled to freedom?
   Surely not; but if he fall into the hands of the law, he shall be
   tried, sentenced, and suffer in prison the penalty of the violated
   right. Let us apply this to sin. There is a law and God is its Author.
   Measured by it, transgressions of omission and commission are called
   sin. But that is not all. The law is not a fetish, nor the formula of a
   moral ideal, but God's commandment; "God spake all these words." God
   stands behind that law, maintains it, and lays it before us. Hence it
   is not enough to measure our act by the law and call it sin, but it
   must also be accounted for to the Lawgiver and acknowledged to be
   guilt.

   Sin is non-conformity of an act, person, or condition to the divine
   law; guilt, encroachment by act, person, or condition upon the divine
   right. Sin creates guilt, because God has a claim upon all our acts. If
   it were possible to act independently of God, such acts, tho deviating
   from the moral ideal, would not create guilt. But since every man's act
   in every condition stands in account with God, every sin creates guilt.
   Yet they are not identical. Sin always lies in us and leaves our
   relation to God untouched; but guilt does not lie in us, but always
   refers to our relation to God. Sin shows what we are in our antagonism
   to the moral ideal; but guilt refers to God's claim upon us and to our
   denial of that claim.

   If God were like a man, this guilt would be compromised. But He is not.
   His claims are as pure gold, perfectly right; not arbitrary, but based
   invariably upon a firm and unchangeable foundation. Hence nothing can
   be deducted from that guilt. According to the strictest measure the
   whole remains forever charged for us.

   Hence the punishment. For punishment is but God's act of resisting the
   encroachment upon His rights. Such encroachments rob God, and would, if
   persisted in, detract from His divinity. And this can not be if He be
   God indeed. Hence His majesty operates directly against this
   encroachment. And this constitutes punishment. Sin, guilt, and
   punishment are inseparable. Only because guilt pursues sin, and
   punishment prosecutes guilt, can sin exist in God's universe.

  XV.

  Our Unrighteousness.

   "My Spirit shall not always strive with man."--Gen. vi. 3.

   Before discussing the work of the Holy Spirit in the sinner's
   restoration, let us consider the interesting but much-neglected
   question whether man stood in fellowship with the Holy Spirit before
   the fall.

   If it is true that the original Adam returns in the regenerated man, it
   follows that the Holy Spirit must have dwelt in Adam as He now dwells
   in God's children. But this is not so. God's word teaches the following
   differences between the two:

   1. Adam's treasure was losable, and that of God's children unlosable.

   2. The former was to obtain eternal life, while the latter already
   possess it.

   3. Adam stood under the Covenant of Works, and the regenerated under
   the Covenant of Grace.

   These differences are essential, and indicate a difference of status.
   Adam did not belong to the ungodly that are justified, but was
   sinlessly just. He did not live by an extraneous righteousness which is
   by faith, as the regenerated, but shone with an original righteousness
   truly his own. He lived under the law which says: "Do this and thou
   shalt live; if not, thou shalt die."

   Hence Adam had no other faith than that which comes by "natural
   disposition." He did not live out of a righteousness which is by faith,
   but out of an original righteousness. The cloud of witnesses in Heb.
   xi. does not begin with sinless Adam, but with Abel before he was
   slain.

   If every right relation of the soul is one of faith, then original
   righteousness necessarily included faith. But this is not Scriptural.
   St. Paul teaches that faith is a temporary grace, which finally enters
   that higher and more intimate fellowship called "sight." Faith as a
   means of salvation is in Scripture always faith in Christ not as the
   Son of God, the Second Person in the Trinity, but as Redeemer, Savior,
   and Surety--in short, faith in Christ and Him crucified. And since
   "Christ and Him crucified" does not belong to unfallen man, it is
   incorrect to place Adam in line with the justified sinner as regards
   faith. Even in the state of righteousness Adam did not live in Christ;
   for Christ is only a sinner's Savior, and not a sphere or element in
   which man lives as man. In the absence of sin, Scripture knows no
   Christ; and St. Paul teaches that, when all the consequences of sin
   shall have ceased, Christ shall deliver the kingdom to the Father, that
   God may be all in all.

   Hence Adam and the regenerate are not the same. The difference between
   their status is most obvious in the fact that out of Christ the latter
   lies in the midst of death, having no life in himself, as St. Paul
   says, "Yet not I, but Christ who liveth in me, who loved me and gave
   Himself for me" (Gal. ii. 20); while Adam had a natural righteousness
   in himself.

   The fathers have always strongly emphasized this point. They taught
   that Adam's original righteousness was not accidental, supernatural,
   added to his nature, but inherent in his nature; not another's
   righteousness imputed to him and appropriated by faith, but a
   righteousness naturally his own. Wherefore Adam needed no substitute;
   he stood for himself in the nature of his own being. Hence his status
   was the opposite of that which constitutes for the child of God the
   glory of his faith.

   Teachers of another doctrine are moved, consciously or unconsciously,
   by philosophic motives. The Ethical theory says: "Properly speaking,
   our salvation is not in the cross, but in Christ's Person. He was God
   and Man, hence divine-human; and this divine-human nature is
   communicable. This being imparted to us, our nature becomes superior in
   kind, and thus we become the children of God." This is a denial of the
   way of faith, and a rejection of the cross and of the whole doctrine of
   Scripture--a fearful error indeed. Its conclusion is: "First, even in
   sin's absence the Son of God would have become man; second, of course
   sinless Adam lived in the God-man."

   Without assenting to these errors, others imprudently teach that
   sinless Adam lived by the righteousness of Christ. Let them be careful
   of the consequences. Scripture allows no theories which obliterate the
   difference between the Covenant of Works and that of Grace.

   But maintaining the approved doctrine of Adam's original righteousness
   as inherent in his nature, and of the divine image as being in-created,
   the important question arises: Was the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
   enjoyed by Adam the same as that now possessed by the new-born soul?

   The answer depends upon one's opinion concerning the nature of the
   original righteousness. Adam's righteousness was intrinsic. He stood
   before God as man ought to stand. He lacked nothing but debt. He
   rendered the Lord all that he owed momentarily; for how long is
   unimportant. One second is long enough to lose one's soul forever, and
   equally long enough to get into the right position before God. Hence
   Adam possessed a perfect good; for righteousness implies holiness, and
   both were perfect. Even the least unholiness would have created an
   immediate deficiency in Adam's returns to God. And when that unholiness
   became a fact, that righteousness was immediately damaged, rent, and
   broken; the least unholiness causes all at once the loss of all
   righteousness. Righteousness has no degrees. That which is not
   perfectly straight is crooked. Right and perfectly right are exactly
   the same. Not perfectly right is not right.

   The question "How Adam was perfectly good" received clearest light from
   the conflict of the Lutherans Flacius Illiricus and Victorinus Strigel.
   The former maintained that man was essentially righteous.

   One's opinion of sin necessarily depends upon his view of goodness, and
   vice versa. A realistic nature is inclined to conceive of sin and
   goodness as material; sin in his opinion is a sort of invisible
   bacterium, almost perceptible by a powerful microscope. And virtue,
   goodness, and holiness have equally a tangible, independent existence,
   measurable and apportionable. This is not so. We may compare the
   spiritual to the material. What else is symbolism? The Scripture sets
   the example, comparing sin to a running sore, to a fire, etc.; and
   goodness to drops of water quenching thirst, becoming a fountain of
   living water in the soul. Let symbolism retain its honorable place in
   this respect. But symbolism is the comparison of things dissimilar,
   hence their identity is excluded. Sin is not something substantial,
   hence virtue and goodness are not essentially independent.

   And yet Flacius Illiricus felt that in this respect there was a
   difference between sin and virtue. Evil is unsubstantial, because it is
   the lack, the default of goodness. But goodness is not the lack, the
   default of evil. Loss indicates that which ought to be, but which is
   lacking. Evil never ought to be, hence never can be a lack. But
   regarding goodness the question is different, viz., whether goodness as
   an extraneous and independent element was added to the soul, so that it
   might be said, "Here is the soul, and there is goodness." And this can
   not be. As a ray is unthinkable without light, so is goodness without a
   person from whom it proceeds.

   And this tempted Flacius Illiricus to teach that originally man was
   essentially righteous. Of course he was wrong. What he wanted to
   attribute to man can be attributed to God alone. Goodness is goodness.
   God is goodness. Goodness is God. In God being and goodness are one.
   There is and can be no difference between the two, for God is perfectly
   good in all respects; hence the faintest separation between God and
   goodness is utterly unthinkable.

   God alone is a simple Being; not as Professor Doedes interprets in his
   criticism on the Confession, as tho in God there can be no distinction
   in persons, but that in God there can be no distinction of essence, as
   between Himself and His attributes. But this is not so in man. We are
   not simple, and can not be, in the same sense. On the contrary, our
   being remains, tho all our attributes are changed or modified. A man
   can be good and ought to be, but without goodness he remains a man; his
   nature becomes corrupt, but his being remains the same.

   Man's being is either deceitful or truthful, not because his soul is
   inoculated with the matter of falsehood or of truth, but by a
   modification of the quality of his being. Inherent goodness has no
   reference to our being, but only to the manner of its existence. As a
   joyous or sorrowful expression of countenance is not the result of an
   external application, but of inward joy or sorrow, so is the soul
   either good or bad according to the manner of its standing before God.

   And this goodness was Adam's direct inheritance from God. God alone is
   the overflowing Fountain of all grace; Adam never wrought a particle of
   good of himself on the ground of which he might have claimed a reward.
   Eternal life was promised him not as a prize or inherent element, but
   by virtue of the conditions of the covenant of works. Just as strongly
   as we oppose the application to sinless Adam of the conditions of the
   Covenant of Grace, as tho he lived in Christ, so strongly do we oppose
   the representation that any virtue, holiness, or righteousness
   proceeded from Adam not wrought by God in him. To deny this would make
   sinless Adam a little fountain of some good, and oppose the confession
   that God alone is the Fountain of all good.

   Hence we arrive at this conclusion, that in Adam all goodness was
   wrought by the Holy Spirit, according to the holy ordinance which
   assigns to the Third Person in the Trinity the inward operation of all
   rational beings.

   However, this does not imply that before the fall the Holy Spirit dwelt
   in Adam as in His temple, as He does in the regenerated child of God.
   In the latter He can only dwell, since the human nature is corrupt and
   unfit to be His vehicle. But not so with Adam. His nature was created
   and calculated to be a vehicle of the Holy Spirit's operations. Hence
   Adam and the regenerated are similar in this respect, that in both
   there is no goodness not wrought by the Holy Spirit; but dissimilar, in
   that the latter can offer only his sinful heart for the Holy Spirit's
   indwelling, while Adam's being underwent His operations without His
   indwelling, organically and naturally.

  Our Death.

   "You who were dead in trespasses and sin."--Ephes. ii. 1.

   Next in order comes the discussion of death.

   There is sin, which is deviation from and resistance against the law.
   There is guilt, which is withholding from God that which, as the Giver
   and Upholder of that law, is due to Him. But there is also punishment,
   which is the Lawgiver's act of upholding His law against the
   lawbreaker. The Sacred Scripture calls this punishment "death."

   To understand what death is, we must first ask: "What is life?"

   And the answer in its most general form is: "A thing lives if it moves
   from within." A man found in the street, leaning against a wall,
   perfectly motionless, is supposed to be dead; but if he turns his head,
   or moves his hand, we know that he is alive. The motion, tho almost
   imperceptible and so feeble that it requires the practised fingers of
   the physician to detect it, is always the sign of life. The muscles may
   be paralyzed, tendons and sinews rigid, yet so long as the pulse beats,
   the heart throbs, and the lungs inhale the air, life is not extinct. In
   the doubtful cases of drowning, trance, or paralysis, the doubt is not
   removed, if removed at all, until motion has been observed. Hence we
   may safely say a body lives if it moves from within.

   This can not be said of a clock, for its mechanism lacks inherent,
   self-moving power. By winding, energy may be stored in its mainspring,
   but when this is spent the clock stops. But life is not a force added
   to a prepared organism, mechanically and temporarily, but an energy
   that inheres in the organism as an organic principle.

   Hence it is plain that the human body has no vital principle in itself,
   but receives it from the soul. The arm is motionless until moved by the
   soul. Even the functions of circulation, breathing, and digesting are
   animated by the soul; for when the soul leaves the body all these
   functions stop. A body without a soul is a corpse. As physical life
   depends upon the union of body and soul, so is physical death the
   result of the dissolution of that bond. As in the beginning God formed
   the human body out of the dust of the earth and breathed into its
   nostrils the breath of life, so that it became a living being, so is
   the dissolving of that bond, which is death to the body, an act of God.
   Death is therefore the removal of that wonderful gift, the bond of
   life. God withdraws the forfeited blessing, and the soul departs in
   separate disembodiment; while the body, freed as a corpse, is delivered
   unto corruption.

   But this does not finish the process of death. Life and death are awful
   opposites, embracing body and soul. "Dying thou shalt die" is the
   divine sentence, which includes the entire person, and not the body
   only. That which possesses creaturely life can also die as a creature.
   Hence the soul, being a creature, can be dispossessed of its creaturely
   life.

   We admit that in another aspect the soul is immortal; but to prevent
   confusion, we beg the reader to put this fact for a moment out of his
   mind. Presently we will return to it.

   Applying our definition of life to the soul as a living creature, it
   follows that the soul lives only when it moves, when acts proceed from
   it, and energies work in it. But its vital principle is not inherent
   any more than in the body, but comes from without. Originally it was
   not self-existing, but God gave it an increated vital principle and
   moving power which He sustained and qualified for work from moment to
   moment. In this respect Adam differed from us. It is true that in the
   soul of the regenerated there is a vital principle, but the source of
   its energy is outside of ourselves in Christ. There is indwelling, but
   not interpermeation. The dweller and his house are distinct. Hence in
   the regenerated man life is extraneous, its seat is not in himself. But
   not so in Adam. Altho the life-principle energizing the soul proceeded
   from God, yet it was deposited in Adam himself.

   To obtain gas from the city's gas-works is one thing; to manufacture it
   at one's own cost, in one's own establishment, is quite another. The
   regenerated child of God receives life directly from Christ, who is
   outside of Him at the right hand of God, through the channels of faith;
   but Adam had the principle of life within him from the Fountain of all
   Good. The Holy Spirit had placed it in his soul, and kept it in active
   operation; not as something extraneous, but as inherent in and peculiar
   to his nature.

   If Adam's life originated in the union which God had established
   between his soul and the life-principle of the Holy Spirit, it follows
   that Adam's death resulted from God's act of dissolving that union
   whereby his soul became a corpse.

   But this is not all. When the body dies it does not disappear; the
   process of death does not stop there. As a unit it becomes incapable of
   organic action, but its constituent parts become capable of producing
   terrible and corrupting effects. Left unburied in a house, the
   poisonous gases of dissolution breed malignant fevers and cause death
   to the inhabitants and the community. After this dissolution of flesh
   and blood, which can not inherit the kingdom of God, the body as such
   continues to exist, with the possibility of being reanimated and
   refashioned into a more glorious body, and of being reunited with the
   soul.

   All this can almost literally be applied to the soul. When a soul dies,
   i.e., is severed from its life-principle, which is the Holy Spirit, it
   becomes perfectly motionless and unable to perform any good work. Some
   things may remain, like loveliness upon the face of the dead; yet,
   however lovely, it is useless and unprofitable. And as a dead body is
   incapable of any act and inclined to all dissolution, so is a dead soul
   incapable of any good and inclined to all evil.

   But this does not imply that a dead soul is devoid of all activity, any
   more than a dead body. As the latter contains blood, carbon, and lime,
   so does the former possess will, feeling, intelligence, and
   imagination. And these elements of a dead soul become equally active
   with still more terrible effects, which are sometimes fearful to
   behold. But as the dead body by all its activities can never produce
   anything to restore its organism, so can the dead soul by all its
   workings accomplish nothing to restore a harmonious utterance before
   God. All its utterances are sinful, even as the dead body emits only
   offensive odors.

   Yea, the parallel goes still further. A corpse may be embalmed, stuffed
   with herbs, and encased as a mummy. Its corruption is invisible, all
   unsightliness carefully concealed. So do many men embalm the dead soul,
   fill it with fragrant herbs, and wrap it like a mummy in a shroud of
   self-righteousness, so that of the indwelling corruption scarcely
   anything appears. But as the Egyptians by their embalming never could
   restore life unto their dead, so can these soul-mummies with all their
   Egyptian arts never kindle one spark of life in their dead souls.

   A dead soul is not annihilated, but continues to exist, and by divine
   grace can be reanimated to a new life. It continues to exist even more
   powerfully than the body. The latter is divisible, but the soul is not.
   Being a unit it can not be divided. Hence soul death is not followed by
   soul-dissolution. It is the poisonous working of the soul-elements
   after death that causes a terrible strain, creating in the indivisible
   soul a vehement desire for dissolution; friction and confusion of
   elements that cry for harmony and peace; violent excitement kindling
   unholy fires; but there is no dissolution. Therefore the soul is called
   immortal, i.e., it can not be divided nor annihilated. It becomes a
   corpse insusceptible of dissolution, in which the poisonous gases will
   continue their pestilential work in hell forever.

   But the soul is also susceptible of new quickening and animation; dead
   in trespasses and sin, severed from the life-principle, its organism
   motionless, incapable, and unprofitable, corrupt and undone, but still
   a human soul. And God, who is merciful and gracious, can reestablish
   the broken bond. The interrupted communion with the Holy Spirit can be
   restored, like the broken fellowship of body and soul.

   And this quickening of the dead soul is regeneration.

   We close this section with one more remark: The breaking of the bond
   which causes death is not always sudden. Death from paralysis is almost
   instantaneous, from consumption slow. When Adam had sinned, death came
   at once; but so far as the body was concerned, its complete severing
   from the soul required more than nine hundred years. But the soul died
   at once, died suddenly; the bond with the Holy Spirit was severed, and
   only its raveling threads remain active in the feelings of shame.

   When we say that soul-death may be less pronounced in one case than in
   another, we do not mean to imply that while the one is dead the other
   is only dying. Nay, both are dead, the soul of each is a corpse; but
   the one is embalmed as a mummy, and the other is in the process of
   dissolution; or, the conflicting, poisonous, and destructive workings
   in the soul of the one have just commenced, while in the other they
   were stimulated and developed by education and other agencies. These
   differences among different persons depend upon the divine grace.

   Dissolution in a body at the North Pole is checked; in a body under the
   Equator it is rapidly accomplished. In like manner dead souls are
   placed in different atmospheres. Hence the differences.

  What Is It?

   "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the
   brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death." --1 John
   iii. 14.

   It is unnecessary to say that the scope of these discussions does not
   include the redemptive work as a whole, which in its choicest sense is
   not of the Holy Spirit alone, but of the Triune God whose royal majesty
   shines and sparkles in it with excellent glory. It includes not only
   the work of the Holy Spirit, but even more that of the Father and of
   the Son. And in these three we see the triune activity of the tender
   mercies of the Triune God.

   These discussions treat only that part of the work which reveals the
   operation of the Holy Spirit.

   The first question in order is that of the so-called "preparatory
   grace." This is a question of surpassing importance, since Methodism
   [25] neglects it and modern orthodoxy abuses it, in order to make the
   determining choice in the work of grace once more to depend upon man's
   free will.

   Regarding the principal point, it must be conceded that there is a
   "gratia proeparans," as our old theologians used to call it, i.e., a
   preparatory grace; not a preparation of grace, but a grace which
   prepares, which is in its preparatory workings real grace, undoubted
   and unadulterated. The Church has always maintained this confession by
   its soundest interpreters and noblest confessors. It could not
   surrender it as long as God is indeed eternal, unchangeable, and
   omnipresent; but by it must forcibly protest against the untrue
   representation that God lets a man be born and live for years unnoticed
   and independent of Himself, suddenly to convert him at the moment of
   His pleasure, from that hour to make him the object of His care and
   keeping.

   Tho it can not be denied that the sinner shared this delusion because
   as he cared not for God, why then should God care for him?--yet the
   Church may not encourage him in this ungodly idea. For it belittles the
   divine virtues, glories, and attributes. Heretics of every name and
   origin have made the soul's salvation their chief study, but almost
   always have neglected the knowledge of God. And yet every creed begins
   with: "I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and
   earth"; and the value of all that follows concerning Christ and our
   redemption depends only upon the correct interpretation of that first
   article. Hence the Church has always insisted upon a pure and correct
   knowledge of God in every confession and in every part of the
   redemptive Work; and has considered it its principal duty and privilege
   to guard the purity of this knowledge. Even a soul's salvation should
   not be desired at the expense of the slightest injury to the purity of
   that confession.

   Regarding the work of preparatory grace, it was before all things
   necessary to examine whether the knowledge of God had been retained in
   its purity, or whether to favor the sinner it had been distorted and
   twisted. And tested by this, it can not be denied that God's care for
   His elect does not begin at an arbitrary moment, but is interwoven with
   their whole existence, including their conception, and even before
   their conception, with the mysteries of that redeeming love which
   declares: "I have loved thee with an everlasting love." Hence it is
   unthinkable that God should have left a sinner to himself for years, to
   arrest him at a certain moment in the midst of his life.

   Nay, if God is to remain God and His omnipresent power unlimited, a
   sinner's salvation must be an eternal work, embracing his entire
   existence--a work whose roots are hidden in the unseen foundations of
   the wondrous mercies which extend far beyond his conception. It can not
   be denied that a man, converted at twenty-five, was during his godless
   life the subject of the divine labor, care, and protection; that in his
   conception and before his birth God's hand held him and brought him
   forth; yea, that even in the divine counsel the work must be traced
   which God has wrought for him long before his conversion:

   The confession of election and foreordination is essentially the
   recognition of a grace active long before the hour of conversion. The
   idea that from eternity God had recorded a mere arbitrary name or
   figure, to quicken it only after many centuries, is truly ungodly. Nay,
   God's elect never stood before His eternal vision as mere names or
   figures; but every soul elect is also foreordained to stand before Him
   in his complete development, the object in Christ of God's eternal
   pleasure.

   Christ's sacrifice on Calvary, which satisfies for the elect,
   justifying them by His Resurrection, was not accomplished independently
   of the elect, but included them all. The resurrection is a work of the
   divine Omnipotence, in which God brings back from the dead not only
   Christ without His own, but Christ with His own. Hence every saint with
   clear spiritual vision confesses that his heavenly Father performs in
   him an eternal work, not begun only in his conversion, but wrought in
   the eternal counsel through the periods of old and new covenants; in
   his person all the days of his life, and which will work in him
   throughout eternity. Even in this general sense the Church may not
   neglect to confess preparatory grace.

   However, the question is narrowed when, excluding what precedes our
   birth, we consider only our sinful life before conversion, or the years
   intervening between the age of discretion and the hour when the scales
   fell from our eyes.

   During those years we departed from God, instead of coming more closely
   to Him. Sin broke out more violently in one than in another, but there
   was iniquity in us all. As often as the plummet was let down beside our
   soul's, they appeared out of the perpendicular. And during this sinful
   period, many hold that preparatory grace is out of the question. They
   say, "Where sin is, there can be no grace"; hence during those years
   the Lord leaves the sinner to himself, to return to him when sin's
   bitter fruit shall be ripe enough to move him to faith and repentance.
   They deny not God's gracious election and foreordination, neither His
   care for His elect in their birth; but they do deny His preparatory
   grace during the years of alienation, and believe that His grace begins
   to operate only when it breaks forth in their conversion.

   Of course there is some truth in this; there is such a thing as the
   abandoning of the sinner to iniquity, when God lets a man walk in his
   own ways, giving him up unto vile passions to do things that are
   unseemly. But instead of interrupting God's labor upon such a soul, the
   very words of Scripture, "to give them up," "to give them over" (Rom.
   i. 24, 28), show that this drifting away upon the current of sin is not
   without God's notice. Men have confessed that, if inward sin had not
   revealed itself, breaking forth in its fury, they would never have
   discovered the inward corruption nor have cried to God for mercy. The
   realization of their guilt and the remembrance of their fearful past
   have been to many saints powerful incitements to labor with strong
   hands and pitying hearts for the rescue of those hopelessly lost in the
   same deadly waters from which they had been saved. The remembrance of
   the deep corruption from which they are now delivered has been to many
   the most potent safeguard from fancied self-righteousness, proud
   bearing, and the conceit of being holier than others. Many depths of
   reconciliation and grace have been discovered and sounded only by
   hearts so deeply wounded that, for the covering of their guilt, a mere
   superficial confession of the atoning blood could not suffice. How
   deeply did David fall; and who ever shouted from mercy's depths more
   jubilantly than he? Who impressed the Church's pure confession more
   profoundly than Augustine, incomparable among the Church fathers, who
   from the abyss of his own guilt and inward brokenness had learned to
   gaze upon the firmament of God's eternal mercies. Even from this
   extreme view of man's sinful way it can not be affirmed that in that
   way God's grace was suspended. Light and shadow are here necessarily
   blended.

   And this is not all. Even tho by sin we have forfeited all, and the
   sinful ego, however virtuous outwardly, has tinctured every action of
   life with sin, yet this is not all of life. In the midst of it all,
   life was shaped and developed. The sinner of five-and-twenty differs
   from the child of three, who by his ugly temper plainly showed his
   sinful nature. During all those years the child has become a man. That
   which slumbered in him has gradually manifested itself. Influences have
   wrought upon him. Knowledge has been mastered and increased. Talents
   have been awakened and developed. Memory and remembrance have
   accumulated treasures of experience. However sinful the form, the
   character has become settled and some of its traits have adopted
   definite lines. The child has become a man--a person, living, existing,
   and thinking differently from other persons. And in all this, so
   confesses the Church, was the hand of the Omnipresent and Almighty God.
   It is He who during all these years of resistance has guided and
   directed His creature according to His own purpose.

   Sooner or later the Sun of Grace will rise upon him, and, since much
   depends upon the condition in which grace shall find him, it is the
   Lord God Himself who prepares that condition. He prepares it by
   graciously restraining his character from adopting traits which would
   prevent him later on from running his course in the kingdom of God,
   and, on the other hand, by graciously developing in him such character
   and such features as will appear after his conversion adapted to the
   task which God intended for him.

   And so it is evident that even during the time of alienation God
   bestows grace upon His elect. Afterward he will perceive how evidently
   all things have worked together for good, not because he intended it
   so, but in spite of his sinful intentions, and only because the
   protecting grace of God was working in and by and through it all. His
   course might have been altogether different. That it is as it is, and
   not much worse, he owes not to himself, but to higher favor. Hence,
   reviewing his life's dark background, the saint thinks at first that it
   contains but a night of Satanic darkness; later on, being better
   instructed, he perceives through that darkness a faint glimmer of
   divine love.

   In fact, in his life there are three distinct periods of thankfulness:

   First, immediately after his conversion, when he can think of no other
   reason of thankfulness than the newly found grace.

   Second, when he learns to render thanks also for the grace of his
   eternal election, extending far behind the first grace.

   Lastly, when the darkness between election and conversion being
   dispelled, he thanks God for the preparatory grace which in the midst
   of that darkness watched over his soul.

  What It Is Not.

   "We are His workmanship."
   --Ephes. ii. 10.

   In the preceding article we contended that there is preparatory grace.
   In opposition to the contemporary deism of the Methodists, [26] the
   Reformed churches ought to confess this excellent truth in all its
   length and breadth. But it should not be abused to reestablish the
   sinner's free will, as the Pelagians did, and the Arminians after them,
   and as the Ethicals do now, tho differently.

   The Methodist errs in saying that God does not care for the sinner
   until He suddenly arrests him in his sinful way. Nor may we tolerate
   the opposite error, the denial of regeneration, the new starting-point
   in the life of the sinner, which would make the whole work of
   conversion but an awakening of dormant and suppressed energies. There
   is no gradual transition; conversion is not merely the healing of
   disease, or an uprising of what had been suppressed; least of all, the
   arousing of dormant energies.

   As regards his first birth, the child of God was dead, and can be
   brought to life only by a second birth as real as the first. Generally
   the person so favored is not conscious of it. In the nature of the
   case, man is unconscious of his first birth. Consciousness comes only
   with the years. And the same applies to regeneration, of which he was
   unconscious until the time of his conversion; and that may be ten or
   twenty years.

   The grounds upon which the Church confesses that a large majority of
   men are born again before holy Baptism are many indeed; wherefore, in
   Baptism, it addresses the infants of believers as being regenerate.

   And what do the Semi-Pelagians of all times and shades, and the
   Ethicals of the present time, teach concerning this? They lower the
   first act of God in the sinners to a sort of preparatory grace,
   imparted not only to the elect, but to all baptized persons. They
   represent it as follows:

   First, all men are conceived and born in sin; and if God did not take
   the first step, all would perish.

   Second, He imparts to the children born in the Christian Church a sort
   of assisting grace, relieving inability.

   Third, hence every baptized person has the power to choose or reject
   the offered grace.

   Fourth, wherefore, out of the many who received preparatory grace, some
   choose life and others perish.

   And this is the confession not of Augustine, but of Pelagius; not of
   Calvin, but of Castellio; not of Gomarus, but of Arminius; not of the
   Reformed churches, but of the sects which they have condemned as
   heretical.

   This impious lie, which pervades this whole representation, must be
   eradicated; and the Methodist brethren deserve our strongest support
   when with holy enthusiasm they oppose this false system. If this
   representation be true, then the counsel of God has lost its certainty
   and stedfastness; then the Mediator's redemptive work is uncertain in
   its application; then our passing from death unto life depends in the
   end upon our own will; and the child of God is robbed of all his
   comfort in life and death, since his new life may be lost.

   It does not avail the Ethical theologians when under many beautiful
   forms they confess their belief in an eternal election, and that grace
   can not be lost, and in the perseverance of saints. As long as they do
   not purge themselves of their principal error--viz., that in Baptism
   God so relieves the inability of the sinner that he can choose life of
   himself--they do not stand on the basis of the Reformed churches, but
   are directly opposed to it. Nor will they be counted as children of the
   Reformed household of faith until, without any subterfuge, they confess
   definitely that preparatory grace does not operate at all, except upon
   persons who will surely come to life, and who will never be lost again.
   To suppose that this grace can work in a man without saving him to the
   uttermost is to break with the doctrine of Scripture and to turn the
   back upon a vital feature of the Reformed churches. We do not deny that
   many persons are lost in whom many excellent powers have wrought. The
   apostle teaches this very clearly in Heb. vi.: "They may have tasted of
   the heavenly gift." But between God's work upon them and that in His
   elect is a great gulf. The workings in these non-elect have nothing in
   common with saving grace; hence preparatory grace, as well as saving
   grace, is altogether out of the question. Surely there is preparatory
   grace, but only for the elect who will certainly come to life, and who
   being once quickened will remain so. The fatal doctrine of three
   conditions--viz., that (1) of the spiritually dead, (2) of the
   spiritually living, and (3) of men hovering between life and
   death--must be abandoned. The spread of this doctrine in our churches
   will surely destroy their spiritual character, as it has done in the
   ancient Huguenot churches of France. Life and death are absolute
   opposites, and a third state between them is unthinkable. He that is
   scarcely alive belongs to the living; and he that has just died belongs
   to the dead. One apparently dead is living, and he that is apparently
   living is dead. The boundary-line is a hair's breadth, and a state
   between does not exist. This applies to the spiritual condition. One
   lives, altho he has received no more than the vital germ, and still
   wanders unconverted in the ways of sin. And he is dead, tho tasting the
   heavenly gift, so long as life is not rekindled in his soul. Every
   other representation is false.

   Others advance the view that preparatory grace prepares not for the
   reception of life, but for conversion. And, this is just as pernicious.
   For then the soul's salvation depends not upon regeneration, but upon
   conversion; and this makes the salvation of our deceased infants
   impossible. Nay, standing by the graves of our baptized young children,
   confident of their salvation through the one Name given under heaven,
   we reject the teaching that salvation depends upon conversion; but
   confess that it is effected by the divine act of creating in to a new
   life, which sooner or later manifests itself in conversion.

   Preparatory grace always precedes the new life; hence it ceases even
   before holy Baptism, in infants quickened before being baptized. Hence
   in a more limited sense, preparatory grace operates only in persons
   quickened later on in life, shortly before conversion. For the sinner
   once quickened has received grace, i.e., the germ of all grace; and
   that which exists can not be prepared.

   A third error, on this point, is the representation that certain moods
   and dispositions must be prepared in the sinner before God can quicken
   him; as tho quickening grace were conditioned upon preparatory grace.
   The salvation of our deceased infants opposes this also. There were no
   moods or dispositions in them; yet no theologian will say that they are
   lost, or that they are saved by another name than the One in whom
   adults find salvation. No; the sinner needs nothing whatever to
   predispose him for the implanting of the new life; and, tho he were the
   most hardened sinner, devoid of every predisposition, God is able at
   His own time to quicken him. The omnipotence of divine grace is
   unlimited.

   The implanting of the new life is not a moral, but a metaphysical act
   of God--i.e., He does not effect it by admonishing the sinner, but
   independently of his will and consciousness; yet despite his will, He
   plants something in him whereby his nature obtains another quality.

   Even the representation, still maintained by some of our best
   theologians, that preparatory grace is like the drying of wet wood, so
   that the spark can more readily ignite it, we can not adopt. Wet wood
   will not take the spark. It must be dried before it can be kindled. And
   this does not apply to the work of grace. The disposition of our souls
   is immaterial. Whatever it may be, omnipotent grace can kindle it. And,
   tho we do not undervalue dispositions, yet we do not concede to them
   the potentiality of kindling.

   For this reason the theologians of the flourishing period of our
   churches insisted that preparatory grace should not be treated loosely,
   but in the following order: "The grace of God first precedes, then
   prepares, and lastly performs (prÃ¦veniens, prÃ¦parans, operans)--i.e.,
   grace is always first, never waits for anything in us, but begins its
   work before there is anything in us. Second, the time before our
   quickening is not wasted, but during it grace prepares us for our
   lifework in the kingdom. Third, at the appointed time grace alone
   quickens us unaided; hence, grace is the operans, the real worker.
   Hence preparatory grace must never be understood as a means to prepare
   for the impartation of life. Nothing prepares for such quickening. Life
   is enkindled, wholly unprepared, not from anything in us, but entirely
   by the working of God. All that preparatory grace accomplishes is this,
   that God by it so disposes our life, arranges its course, and directs
   our development that being quickened by His exclusive act, we shall
   possess the disposition required for the task assigned to us in the
   kingdom.

   Our person is like the field wherein the sower is to scatter the seed.
   Suppose there are two fields in which the seed must be sown; the one
   has been plowed, fertilized, harrowed, and cleared of stones, while the
   other lies fallow, uncared for. What is the result? Does the former
   produce wheat of itself? By no means; the furrows were never so deep
   and the ground never so rich and smooth, if it receives no seed-grain
   it will never yield a single ear. And the other, not cultivated, will
   surely germinate the seed scattered therein. The origin of the wheat
   sown has no connection with the cultivation of the field, since the
   seed-grain is conveyed thither from elsewhere. But to the growth of the
   wheat, cultivation is of greatest importance. And so it is in the
   spiritual kingdom. Whether great or small, preparatory grace
   contributes nothing to the origin of life, which springs from the
   "incorruptible seed" sown in the heart. But to its development it is of
   greatest importance.

   This is why the Reformed churches so strongly insist upon the careful
   training of our children. For, altho we confess that all our training
   can not create the least spark of heavenly fire; yet we know that when
   God puts that spark into their hearts, kindling the new fife, much will
   depend upon the condition in which it finds them.

REGENERATION.

  Old and New Terminology.

   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh."--John iii. 6.

   Before we examine the work of the Holy Spirit in this important matter,
   we must first define the use of words.

   The word "regeneration" isused in a limited sense, and in a more
   extended sense.

    It is used in the limited sense when it denotes exclusively God's act
   of quickening, which is the first divine act whereby God translates us
   from death into life, from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
   His dear Son. In this sense regeneration is the starting-point. God
   comes to one born in iniquity and dead in trespasses and sins, and
   plants the principle of a new spiritual life in his soul. Hence he is
   born again.

   But this is not the interpretation of the Confession of Faith, for
   article 24 reads: "We believe that this true faith, being wrought in
   man by the hearing of the Word of God and the operation of the Holy
   Ghost, doth regenerate and make him a new man, causing him to live a
   new life, and freeing him from the bondage of sin." Here the word
   "regeneration," used in its wider sense, denotes the entire change by
   grace effected in our persons, ending in our dying to sin in death and
   our being born for heaven. While formerly this was the usual sense of
   the word, we are accustomed now to the limited sense, which we
   therefore adopt in this discussion.

   Respecting the difference between the two--formerly the work of grace
   was generally represented as the soul consciously observed it; while
   now the work itself is described apart from the consciousness.

   Of course, a child knows nothing of the genesis of his own existence,
   nor of the first period of his life, from his own observation. If he
   were to tell his history from his own recollections, he would begin
   with the time that he sat in his high chair, and proceed until as a man
   he went out into the world. But, being informed by others of his
   antecedents, he goes back of his recollections and speaks of his
   parents, family, time, and place of birth, how he grew up, etc. Hence
   there is quite a difference between the two accounts.

   The same difference we observe in the subject before us. Formerly it
   was customary, after the manner of Romish scholastics, to describe
   one's experience from one's own recollections. Being personally
   ignorant of the implanting of the new life, and remembering only the
   great spiritual disturbance, which led one to faith and repentance, it
   was natural to date the beginning of the work of grace not from
   regeneration, but from the conviction of sin and faith, thence
   proceeding to sanctification, and so on.

   But this subjective representation, more or less incomplete, can not
   satisfy us now. It was to be expected that the supporters of "free
   will" would abuse it, by inferring that the origin and first activities
   of the work of salvation spring from man himself. A sinner, hearing the
   Word, is deeply impressed; persuaded by its threats and promises, he
   repents, arises, and accepts the Savior. Hence there is nothing more
   than a mere moral persuasion, obscuring the glorious origin of the new
   life. To resist this repulsive deforming of the truth, Maccovius,
   already in the days of the Synod of Dort, abandoned this more or less
   critical method to make regeneration the starting-point. He followed
   this order: "Knowledge of sin, redemption in Christ, regeneration, and
   only then faith." And this was consistent with the development of the
   Reformed doctrine. For as soon as the subjective method was abandoned,
   it became necessary in answer to the question, "What has God wrought in
   the soul?" to return to the first implanting of life. And then it
   became evident that God did not begin by leading the sinner to
   repentance, for repentance must be preceded by conviction of sin; nor
   by bringing him under the hearing of the word, for this requires an
   opened ear. Hence the first conscious and comparatively cooperative act
   of man is always preceded by the original act of God, planting in him
   the first principle of a new life, under which act man is wholly
   passive and unconscious.

   This led to the distinction of the first and second grace. The former
   denoted God's work in the sinner, creating a new life without his
   knowledge; while the latter denoted the work wrought in regenerate man
   with his full knowledge and consent.

   The first grace was naturally called regeneration. And yet there was no
   perfect unanimity in this respect. Some Scottish theologians put it in
   this way: "God began the work of grace with the implanting of the
   faith-faculty (fides potentialis), followed by the new grace of the
   faith-exercise (fides actualis), and of the faith power (fides
   habitualis). Yet it is only an apparent difference. Whether I call the
   first activity of grace, the implanting of the "faith-faculty," or the
   "new principle of life," in both instances it means that the work of
   grace does not begin with faith or with repentance or contrition, but
   that these are preceded by God's act of giving power to the powerless,
   hearing to the deaf, and life to the dead.

   For a correct idea of the entire work of grace in its different phases
   let us notice the following successive stages or milestones:

   1. The implanting of the new life principle, commonly called
   regeneration inthe limited sense, or the implanting of the
   faith-faculty. This divine act is wrought in man at different ages;
   when, no one can tell. We know from the instance of John the Baptist
   that it can be wrought even in the mother's womb. And the salvation of
   deceased infants constrains us, with Voetius and all profound
   theologians, to believe that this original act may occur very early in
   life.

   2. The keeping of the implanted principle of life, while the sinner
   still continues in sin, so far as his consciousness is concerned.
   Persons who received the life-principle early in life are no more dead,
   but live. Dying before actual conversion, they are not lost, but saved.
   In early life they often manifest holy inclinations; sometimes truly
   marvelous. However, they have no conscious faith, nor knowledge of the
   treasure possessed. The new life is present, but dormant; kept not by
   the recipient, but by the Giver--like seed-grain in the ground in
   winter; like the spark glowing under the ashes, but not kindling the
   wood; like a subterranean stream coming at last to the surface.

   3. The call by the Word and the Spirit, internal and external. Even
   this is a divine act, commonly performed through the service of the
   Church. It addresses itself not to the deaf but to the hearing, not to
   the dead but to the living, altho still slumbering. It proceeds from
   the Word and the Spirit, because not only the faith-faculty, but faith
   itself--i.e., the power and exercise of the faculty--are gifts of
   grace. The faith-faculty can not exercise faith of itself. It avails us
   no more than the faculty of breathing when air and the power to breathe
   are withheld. Hence the preaching of the Word and the inward working of
   the Holy Spirit are divine, correspondent operations. Under the
   preaching of the Word the Spirit energizes the faith-faculty, and thus
   the call becomes effectual, for the sleeper arises.

   4. This call of God produces conviction of sin and justification, two
   acts of the same exercise of faith. In this, God's work may be
   represented again either subjectively or objectively. Subjectively, it
   seems to the saint that conviction of sin and heart-brokenness came
   first, and that then he obtained the sense of being justified by faith.
   Objectively, this is not so. The realization of his lost condition was
   already a bold act of faith. And by every subsequent act of faith he
   becomes more deeply convinced of his misery and receives more
   abundantly from the fulness which is in Christ, his Surety.

   Concerning the question, whether conviction of sin must not precede
   faith, there need be no difference. Both representations amount to the
   same thing. When a man can say for the first time in his life "I
   believe," he is at the same moment completely lost and completely
   saved, being justified in his Lord.

   5. This exercise of faith results in conversion; at this stage in the
   way of grace the child of God becomes clearly conscious of the
   implanted life. When a man says and feels "I believe," and does not
   recall it, but God confirms it, faith is at once followed by
   conversion. The implanting of the new life precedes the first act of
   faith, but conversion follows it. Conversion does not become a fact so
   long as the sinner only sees his lost condition, but when he acts upon
   this principle; for then the old man begins to die and the new man
   begins to rise, and these are the two parts of all real conversion.

   In principle man is converted but once, viz., the moment of yielding
   himself to Immanuel. After that he converts himself daily, i.e., as
   often as he discovers conflict between his will and that of the Holy
   Spirit. And even this is not man's work, but the work of God in him.
   "Turn Thou me, O Lord, and I shall be turned." There is this
   difference, however, that in regeneration and faith's first exercise he
   was passive, while in conversion grace enabled him to be active. One is
   converted and one converts himself; the one is incomplete without the
   other.

   6. Hence conversion merges itself in sanctification. This is also a
   divine act, and not human; not a growing toward Christ, but an
   absorbing of His life through the roots of faith. In children of twelve
   or thirteen deceased soon after conversion, sanctification does not
   appear. Yet they partake of it just as much as adults. Sanctification
   has a twofold meaning: first, sanctification which as Christ's finished
   work is given and imputed to all the elect; and second, sanctification
   which from Christ is gradually wrought in the converted and manifested
   according to times and circumstances. These are not two
   sanctifications, but one; just as we speak sometimes of the rain that
   accumulates in the clouds above and then comes down in drops on the
   thirsty fields below.

   7. Sanctification is finished and closed in the complete redemption at
   the time of death. In the severing of body and soul divine grace
   completes the dying to sin. Hence in death a work of grace is performed
   which imparts to the work of regeneration its fullest unfolding. If
   until then, considering ourselves out of Christ, we are still lost in
   ourselves and lying in the midst of death, the article of death ends
   all this. Then faith is turned into sight, sin's excitement is
   disarmed, and we are forever beyond its reach.

   Lastly, our glorification in the last day, when the inward bliss will
   be manifest in outward glory, and by an act of omnipotent grace the
   soul will be reunited with its glorified body, and be placed in such
   heavenly glory as becomes the state of perfect felicity.

   This shows how the operations of grace are riveted together as the
   links of a chain. The work of grace must begin with quickening the
   dead. Once implanted, the still slumbering life must be awakened by the
   call. Thus awakened, man finds himself in a new life, i.e., he knows
   himself justified. Being justified, he lets the new life result in
   conversion. Conversion flows into sanctification. Sanctification
   receives its keystone through the severing of sin in death. And in the
   last day, glorification completes the work of divine grace in our
   entire person.

   Hence it follows that that which succeeds is contained in that which
   precedes. A regenerate deceased infant died to sin in death just as
   surely as the man with hoary head and fourscore years. There can be no
   first without including the second and last. Hence the entire work of
   grace might be represented as one birth for heaven, one continued
   regeneration to be completed in the last day.

   Wherefore there may be persons ignorant of these stages, which are as
   indispensable as milestones to the surveyor; but they may never be made
   to oppress the souls of the simple. He who breathes deeply unconscious
   of his lungs is often the healthiest.

   Touching the question whether the Scripture gives reference to this
   arrangement over the old, we refer to the word of Jesus: "Except a man
   be born of water and the Spirit he can not see the kingdom of God"
   (John iii. 5); from which we infer that Jesus dates every operation of
   grace from regeneration. First life, and then the activity of life.

  Its Course.

   "No man can come unto Me, except the Father draw him." --John vi. 44.

   From the preceding it is evident that preparatory grace is different in
   different persons; and that distinction must be made between the many
   regenerated in the first days of life, and the few born again at a more
   advanced age.

   Of course, we refer only to the elect. In the non-elect saving grace
   does not operate; hence preparatory grace is altogether out of the
   question. The former are born, with few exceptions, in the Church. They
   do not enter the covenant of grace later on in life, but they belong to
   it from the first moment of their existence. They spring from the seed
   of the Church, and in turn contain in themselves the seed of the future
   Church. And for this reason, the first germ of the new life is imparted
   to the seed of the Church (which is, alas! always mixed with much
   chaff) oftenest either before or soon after birth.

   The Reformed Church was so firmly settled in this doctrine that she
   dared establish it as the prevailing rule, believing that the seed of
   the Church (not the chaff of course} received the germ of life even
   before Baptism; wherefore it is actually sanctified in Christ already;
   and receives in Baptism the seal not upon something that is yet to
   come, but upon that which is already present. Hence the liturgical
   question to the parents: "Do you acknowledge that, altho your children
   are conceived and born in sin, and therefore are subject to
   condemnation itself, yet that they are sanctified in Christ, and
   therefore as members of His Church ought to be baptized?"

   In subsequent periods, less stedfast in the faith, men have shunned
   this doctrine, not knowing what to make of the words "are sanctified."
   This they interpreted to mean that as children of members of the
   covenant they were counted as belonging to the covenant, and as such
   were entitled to baptism. But the earnest and sound common sense of our
   people has always felt that this mere "counting in" did not do justice
   to the full and rich meaning of the liturgy.

   And if you should inquire into the meaning of these words of the office
   of Baptism, "are sanctified," not of the weaker epigones, but of the
   energetic generation of heroes who have victoriously fought the Lord's
   battles against Arminius and his followers, then you would discover
   that those godly and learned theologians, such as Gysbrecht Voetius for
   instance, never for a moment hesitated to break with these half-way
   explanations, but spoke out plainly, saying: "They are entitled to
   Baptism not because they are counted as members of the covenant but
   because as a rule they actually already possess that first grace; and
   for this reason, and this reason alone, it reads: That our children are
   sanctified in Christ, and therefore as members of His body ought to be
   baptized.'"

   By this confession the Reformed Church proved to be in accord with
   God's Word and not less with the actual facts. With few exceptions,
   persons who afterward prove to belong to the regenerate do not begin
   life with riotous outbreaks of sin. It is rather the rule that children
   of Christian parents manifest from early childhood a desire and taste
   for holy things, warm zeal for the name of God, and inward emotions
   that can not be attributed to an evil nature.

   Moreover, this glorious confession gave the right direction to the
   education of children in our Reformed families, largely retained to the
   present time. Our people did not see in their children offshoots of the
   wild vine, to be grafted perhaps later on, with whom little could be
   done until converted after the manner of Methodism; [27] but they lived
   in the quiet expectation and holy confidence that the child to be
   trained was already grafted, and therefore worthy to be nursed with
   tenderest care. We admit that, latterly, since the Reformed character
   of our churches has been impaired by the National Church as a church
   for the masses, this gold has been sadly dimmed; but its original,
   vital thought was beautiful and animating. It made God's work of
   regeneration precede man's work; to Baptism it gave its rich
   development; and it made the work of education, not dependent on
   chance, cooperate with God.

   Hence we recognize among the rising generation in the Church four
   classes:

   1. All elect persons regenerated before Baptism, in whom the implanted
   life remains hidden until they are converted at a later age.

   2. Elect persons, not only regenerated in infancy, but in whom the
   implanted life was early manifested and ripened imperceptibly into
   conversion.

   3. Elect persons born again, and converted in later life.

   4. The non-elect, or the chaff.

   Examining each of these four, with special reference to preparatory
   grace, we arrive at the following conclusions:

   Regarding the elect of the first class, from the very nature of the
   case preparatory grace has scarcely room here, in its limited sense. In
   its direct form, it is unthinkable with reference to an unborn or
   new-born child. In such it is only indirect--i.e., frequently, it
   pleases God to give such child parents whose persons and nature's
   practise a form of sin less outspoken in its war upon grace than other
   forms of sin. Not as, tho such parents had anything from which the
   child could be grafted, for that which is born of the flesh is flesh;
   nothing clean from the unclean; it is always the wild vine waiting for
   the grafting of the Lord. Nay, the preparatory grace in this case
   appears from the fact that the child receives from its parents a form
   of life adapted to its heavenly calling.

   The same applies to the elect of the second class. Altho we concede
   that the divine call works upon such during their tender years, yet,
   while it prepares for conversion, it does not prepare for regeneration,
   which it follows. The call is ineffectual unless the faculty of hearing
   be first implanted. Only he that has an ear can hear what the Spirit
   saith unto the churches and to his own soul. Hence, in this case,
   preparatory grace is scarcely perceptible. Surely there are many
   agencies that imperceptibly prepare for his conversion; but this is
   different from a preparing for regeneration, and we speak now only of
   the latter.

   Properly speaking, preparatory grace in its limited sense is applied
   only to the third class of elect persons. It comprehends their whole
   life with all its turns and changes, relations and connections, heights
   and depths, events and adversities. Not as tho all these could produce
   the slightest germ of life or possibility of quickening. No; the germ
   of life can never spring from preparatory grace, any more than the
   preparation of ten cradles, of a dozen of clothes baskets, and of
   closets full of expensive infant-garments can ever juggle a single
   infant into any of those cradles. The vital spark is produced only by
   an act of the mighty God, independent of all preparation. But, from its
   birth, God guards that wild-vine and controls the growth of its wild
   shoots, so that in the hour of His pleasure, when He shall graft upon
   it the true vine, it may be all that it ought to be.

   And this ends the discussion, for regarding the fourth class, by and by
   they will be separated from the wheat and blown away by the fan which
   is in His hand; hence preparatory grace is out of the question.

   And from this it is evident that the proper work of the Holy Spirit
   regarding preparatory grace is scarcely perceptible.

   Every feature of this work, so far presented, points directly not to
   the operation of the Holy Spirit, nor to that of the Son, but almost
   exclusively to that of the Father. For the circumstances of the child's
   birth--i.e., the hereditary character of his family and more especially
   of his parents, and the future course of his life until the moment of
   his conversion--belong to the realm of the divine Providence. The
   appointed place of our habitation, our generation and family, the
   formation of our immediate environment, the influences previously
   determined to affect us--all belong to the leadings of God's
   providence, ascribed by Scripture to the work of the Father. The Lord
   Jesus said: "No man can come unto Me, except the Father draw him." And
   altho this drawing of the Father has a higher aim and must be
   spiritually understood, yet it indicates generally that the determining
   of those things, which afterward regulates their direction and course,
   is attributed particularly to the First Person.

   We notice a work of the Holy Spirit in this matter only as far as He
   animates all personal life, since He is the Spirit of Life; and as He
   cooperates with the Father in that special providence which refers to
   the elect. For, altho in our mind we can analyze the work of grace, yet
   we may never forget that the eternal reality does not fully correspond
   to this part of our analysis.

   Hence, in the elect, the work of providence and that of grace often
   flow together, being one and the same. Our Church has tried to express
   this, in her confession of a general providence which includes

  Regeneration the Work of God.

   "The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath even made both of
   them."--Prov. xx. 12.

   "The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath even made both of
   them." This testimony of the Holy Spirit contains the whole mystery of
   regeneration.

   An unregenerate person is deaf and blind; not only as a stock or block,
   but worse. For neither stock nor block is corrupt or ruined, but an
   unregenerate person is wholly dead and a prey to the most fearful
   dissolution.

   This rigid, uncompromising, and absolute confession must be our
   starting-point in this discussion, else we shall fail to understand the
   claims of regeneration. This is the reason why every heresy that has
   conceded in one way or other that man has a share, most generally a
   lion's share, in the work of redemption, has always begun by calling in
   question the nature of sin. "Undoubtedly," they said, "sin is very
   bad--a terrible and abominable evil; but there is surely some remnant
   of good in man. That noble, virtuous, and amiable being, man, can not
   be dead in trespasses and sin. That may be true of some scoundrel or
   knave behind the bars, or of robbers and unscrupulous murderers; but
   really, it can not be applied to our honorable ladies and gentlemen, to
   our lovely girls, roguish boys, and attractive children. These are not
   prone to hate God and their neighbors, but disposed, with all their
   heart, to love all men, and render unto God the reverence due unto
   Him."

   Therefore away with all ambiguity in this matter! This method of
   smoothing over unpalatable truths, now so much in vogue among the
   affable people, we can not indorse. Our confession is, and ever shall
   be, that by nature man is dead in trespasses and sin, lying under the
   curse, ripe for the just judgment of God, and still ripening for an
   eternal condemnation. Surely his being, as man, is unimpaired;
   wherefore we protest against the presentation that the sinner is in
   this respect as a stock or block. No; as man he is unimpaired, his
   being is intact; but his nature is corrupt, and in that corrupt nature
   he is dead.

   We compare him to the body of a person who has died of an ordinary
   disease. Such a body retains all the members of the human organism
   intact. There is the eye with its muscles, and the ear with its organs
   of hearing; in the post-mortem examination heart, spleen, liver, and
   kidneys appear to be perfectly normal. A dead body may sometimes appear
   so natural that one is tempted to say: "He is not dead, but sleeping."
   And yet, however perfect and natural, its nature is corrupt with the
   corruption of death. And the same is true of the sinner. His being
   remains intact and whole, containing all that which constitutes a man;
   but his nature is corrupt, yea, so corrupt that he is dead; not only
   apparently, but actually dead; dead in all the variations which can be
   played upon the term "dead."

   Hence without regeneration the sinner is utterly unprofitable. What is
   the use of an ear except it hear, or of an eye except it see? Therefore
   the Holy Ghost testifies: "The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord
   has made even both of them." [28] And since in the world of spiritual
   things deaf ears and blind eyes do not avail anything, the Church of
   Christ confesses that every operation of saving grace must be preceded
   by a quickening of the sinner, by an opening of blind eyes, an
   unstopping of deaf ears--in short, by the implanting of the faculty of
   faith.

   And as the man that sat in darkness can see as soon as his eyes are
   opened, so we, without moving a hair's breadth, are translated from the
   kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light. "Translated" does not
   denote here an actual going, nor does "to be translated" denote an
   actual change of place, but simply life entering into the dead, so that
   he that was blind can now see.

   This wonderful act of regeneration may be examined in two classes of
   persons: in the infant and in the adult.

   It is the safest way to examine it in the infant: not because this work
   of grace is different in an infant from what it is in an adult, for it
   is the same in all persons thus favored; but to the conscious
   observation of an adult the workings of regeneration are so mingled
   with those of conversion that it is difficult to distinguish the two.

   But this difficulty does not exist in the case of an unconscious child,
   as, e.g., in John the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth. Such infant has
   no consciousness to create confusion. The matter appears in a pure and
   unmixed form. And thus we are enabled to distinguish between
   regeneration and conversion in an adult. It is evident that in the case
   of an infant which, like John, is still unborn, there can be nothing
   but mere passivity--i.e., the child underwent something, but himself
   did nothing; something was done to him, and in him, but not by him; and
   every idea of cooperation is absolutely excluded.

   Hence, in regeneration, man is neither worker nor coworker; he is
   merely wrought upon; and the only Worker in this matter is God. And,
   for this very reason, because God is the sole Worker in regeneration,
   it must be thoroughly understood that His work does not begin only with
   regeneration.

   No; while the sinner is still dead in trespasses and sins, before the
   work of God has begun in him, he is already chosen and ordained,
   justified and sanctified, adopted as God's child and glorified. This is
   what filled St. Paul with such ecstasy of joy when he said: "For whom
   He did foreknow, He also did predestinate; and whom He did
   predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also
   justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified" (Rom. viii.
   29, 30). And this is not the recital of what took place in the
   regenerate, but the glad summing up of the things which God
   accomplished for us before we existed. Hence our election,
   foreordination, justification, and glorification precede the new birth.
   It is true that, in the hour of love when regeneration was to be
   effected in us, the things accomplished outside of our consciousness
   were to be revealed to the consciousness of faith; but so far as God
   was concerned all things were ready and prepared. The dead sinner whom
   God regenerates is to the divine consciousness a beloved, elect,
   justified, and adopted child already. God quickens only His dear
   children.

   Of course, God justifies the ungodly and not the righteous; He calls
   sinners to repentance and not just persons; but it should be remembered
   that this is spoken from the point of view of our own consciousness of
   sin. The still unregenerate does not feel himself God's child, nor that
   he is justified; does not believe his own election, yea, often gainsays
   it; yet he can not alter the things divinely wrought in his behalf,
   viz., that before the supreme bar of justice God declared him just and
   free, long before he was so declared before the bar of his own
   conscience. Long before he believed, he was justified before God's
   tribunal, by and by to be justified by faith before his own
   consciousness.

   But, however wonderful and unfathomable the mystery of election may
   be--and none of us shall ever be able to answer the question why one
   was chosen to be a vessel of honor, and another was left as a vessel of
   wrath--in the matter of regeneration we do not face that mystery at
   all. That God regenerates one and not another is according to a fixed
   and unalterable rule. He comes with regeneration to all the elect; and
   the non-elect He passes by. Hence this act of God is irresistible. No
   man has the power to say, "I will not be born again," or to prevent
   God's work or to put obstacles in His way, or to make it so difficult
   that it can not be performed.

   God effects this gracious work in His own way, i.e., He so royally
   perseveres that all creatures together could not rob Him of one of His
   elect. If all men and devils should conspire to pluck a brutal man,
   belonging to the elect, from His saving power, all their efforts would
   be mere vanity. As we brush away a spider's web, so would God laugh at
   all their commotion. The powerful steam borer pierces the iron plate
   not more noiselessly and with less effort than silently and
   majestically God penetrates the heart of whomsoever He will, and
   changes the nature of His chosen. Isaiah's word concerning the starry
   heavens--"Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
   things, that bringeth out their hosts by number; He calleth them all by
   name, by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power;
   not one faileth " [29] may be applied to the firmament in which God's
   elect shine as stars: "Because of the greatness of His might, and that
   He is strong in power, not one faileth." All that are ordained to
   eternal life are quickened at the divinely appointed hour.

   And this implies that the work of regeneration is not a moral work;
   that is, it is not accomplished by means of advice or exhortation. Even
   taken in its wider sense, including conversion, as, e.g., the canons of
   Dort use it now and then, regeneration is not a moral working in the
   soul.

   It is not simply a case of misunderstanding, the sinner's will being
   still uncorrupt, so that it requires only instruction and advice to
   induce it to choose rightly. No; such advice and admonition are wholly
   out of the question regarding the unborn son of Zacharias; and the
   thousands of infants of believing parents, of whom at Dort it was
   correctly confessed that they may be supposed to have died in the Lord,
   i.e., being born again; and regarding those regenerated before Baptism
   but converted later in life.

   For this reason it is so necessary to examine regeneration (in its
   limited sense) in an infant, and not in an adult, in whom it
   necessarily includes conversion.

   The following reasoning can not be disputed:

   1. All men, infants included, are born dead in trespasses and sins.

   2. Of these infants many die before they come to self-consciousness.

   3. Of these gathered flowers the Church confesses that many are saved.

   4. Being dead in sin, they can not be saved without being born again.

   5. Hence regeneration does actually take place in persons that are not
   self-conscious.

   These statements being indisputable, it is evident, therefore, that the
   nature and character of regeneration can be determined most correctly
   by examining it in these still unconscious persons.

   Such an unborn infant is totally ignorant of human language; it has no
   ideas, has never heard the Gospel preached, can not receive
   instruction, warning, or exhortation. Hence moral influence is out of
   the question; and this convinces us that regeneration is not a moral,
   but a metaphysical act of God, just as much as the creation of the soul
   of an unborn child, which is effected independently of the mother. God
   regenerates a man wholly without his foreknowledge.

   What it is that constitutes the act of regeneration can not be told.
   Jesus Himself tells us so, for He says: "The wind bloweth where it
   listeth, and thou Nearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence
   it cometh and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the
   Spirit." [30] And, therefore, it is befitting to investigate this
   mystery with the utmost discretion. Even in the natural kingdom the
   mystery of life and its origin is almost entirely beyond our knowledge.
   The most learned physician is entirely ignorant concerning the manner
   in which a human life comes into existence. Once existing, he can
   explain its deveopment, but of the inception that preceeds all else he
   knows absolutely nothing. In this respect he is just as ignorant as the
   most innocent peasant boy. The mystery can not be penetrated, simply
   because it lies beyond our observation; it is perceptible only that
   life exists.

   And this applies in stronger sense to the mystery of our second birth.
   Post-mortem examination can detect the embryo and its locality, but
   spiritually even this is impossible. Subsequent manifestations are
   instructive to a certain extent, but even then much is uncertain and
   unsettled. By what infallible standard can it be determined how much of
   the old nature enters into the expressions of the new life? Is there no
   hypocrisy? Are there no conditions unexplained? Are there no obstacles
   to spiritual development? Hence experience in this respect can not
   avail; tho pure and simple, it can reveal only the development of that
   which is, and not the origin of the life unborn.

   The only source of truth on this subject is the Word of God; and in
   that Word the mystery remains not only unrevealed, but veiled. And for
   good reasons. If we were to effect regeneration, if we could add to or
   take from it, if we could advance or hinder it, then Scripture would
   surely have sufficiently instructed us concerning it. But since God has
   reserved this work altogether to Himself, man need not solve this
   mystery any more than that of his first creation, or that of the
   creation of his soul.

  The Work of Regeneration.

   "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things
   are passed away; behold all things are become new."--2 Cor. v. 17.

   In our former article we contended that regeneration is a real act of
   God in which man is absolutely passive and unable, according to the
   ancient confession of the Church. Let us now reverently examine this
   matter more closely; not to penetrate into things too high for us, but
   to cut off error and to clear the consciousness.

   Regeneration is not sacramentally effected by holy Baptism, relieving
   the sinner's inability, offering him another opportunity to choose for
   or against God, as the Ethicals maintain.

   Nor is it a mere rectifying of the understanding; nor a simple change
   of disposition and inclination, making the unwilling willing to conform
   to the holy will of God.

   Neither is it a change of ego; nor, as many maintain, a leaving the ego
   undisturbed, the personality unchanged, simply putting the evil ego in
   the light and reflection of the righteousness of Christ.

   The last two errors must be refuted and rejected as positively as the
   first two.

   In regeneration a man does not receive another ego; i.e., our being as
   man is not changed nor modified, but before and after regeneration it
   is the same ego, the same person, the same human being. Altho sin has
   terribly corrupted man, his being remained intact. Nothing is lacking.
   All its constituent parts, that distinguish it from all other beings,
   are present in the sinner.

   Not his being, but his nature became totally corrupt.

   Nature and being are not the same. Applied to a steam-engine, being is
   the engine itself, with its cylinders, pipes, wheels, and screws; but
   its nature is the action manifest as soon as steam enters the cylinder.
   Applied to man, being is that which makes him man, and nature that
   which manifests the character of his being and working.

   If sin had ruined man's being, he would be no more man, and
   regeneration would be impossible. But since his being, his ego, his
   person remained intact and the deep corruption affected only his
   nature, regeneration, i.e., restoration of his nature, is possible; and
   this restoration is effected by the new birth. Let this be firmly
   maintained. In regeneration we do not receive a new being, ego, or
   person, but our nature is reborn.

   The best and most satisfactory illustration of the manner of
   regeneration is furnished by the curious art of grafting. The
   successful grafting of a budding shoot of the cultivated grape upon the
   wild vine results in a good tree growing upon the wild trunk. This
   applies to all fruit-trees and flowering plants. The cultivated can be
   grafted upon the wild. Left to itself, the wild will never yield
   anything good. The wild pear and the wild rose remain stunted and chary
   of fruit and blossom. But let the gardener graft a finely flavored pear
   upon the wild pear, or a beautiful double tea rose upon the wild rose,
   and the former will yield luscious fruit and the latter magnificent
   flowers.

   This miracle of grafting has always been a wonder to thinking men. And
   it is a wonder. The trunk to be grafted is absolutely wild; with its
   wild roots it sucks the saps and forces them into its wild cells. But
   that little graft has the wonderful power of converting the sap and
   vital forces into something good, causing that wild trunk to bear noble
   fruit and rich flowers. It is true the wild trunk vigorously resists
   the reformation of its nature by its wild shoots below the graft, and
   if successful its wild nature will forcibly assert itself and prevent
   the sap from passing through the bud. But by keeping down those wild
   shoots the sap can be forced to the bud with excellent results. Forcing
   down the wild trunk, the graft will gradually reach almost to the
   roots, and we nearly forget that the tree was ever wild.

   This clearly represents regeneration so far as this divine mystery can
   be represented objectively. For in regeneration something is planted in
   man which by nature he lacks. The fall did not merely remove him from
   the sphere of divine righteousness, into which regeneration brings him
   back, but regeneration effects a radical modification in man as man,
   creating a difference between him and the unregenerate so great that
   finally it leads to direct opposites.

   To say that between the regenerate and the unregenerate there is no
   difference is equivalent to a denial of the work of the Holy Spirit.
   Generally, however, no difference is noticed at first, no more than in
   the grafted tree. Twins lie in the same cradle; one regenerated, the
   other not, but we can not see the slightest difference between the two.
   The former may even have a worse temper than the latter. They are
   exactly alike. Both spring from the same wild trunk. Dissecting knife
   nor microscope could detect the least difference; for that which God
   has wrought in the favored child is wholly spiritual and invisible,
   discernible to God alone.

   This fact must be confessed definitely and emphatically, in opposition
   to those who say that the seed of regeneration is material. This error
   occupies the same ground as the Manichean heresy in the matter of sin.
   The latter makes sin a microbe; and this makes the seed of regeneration
   a sort of perceptible germ of life and holiness. And this falsifies the
   truth against which, among others, Dr. BÃ¶hl has earnestly protested.

   The seed of regeneration is intangible, invisible, purely spiritual. It
   does not create two men in one being, but before and after regeneration
   there is but one being, one ego, one personality. Not an old and a new
   man, but one man--viz., the old man before regeneration, and the new
   man after it--who is created after God in perfect righteousness and
   holiness. For that which is born of God can not sin. His seed remaineth
   in him. "Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become
   new." (2 Cor. v. 17)

   Yet the nature of the ego or personality is truly changed, and in such
   a way that, putting on the new nature in principle, he still continues
   to work through the old nature. The grafted tree is not two trees, but
   one. Before the grafting it was a wild rose, after it a cultivated one.
   Still the new nature must draw its saps through the old nature; apart
   from the graft, the trunk remains wild.

   Hence before as well as after regeneration we lie in the midst of
   death, as soon as we consider ourselves outside of the divine seed.
   Wherefore, trying to avoid one false position, we must be careful not
   to run into another; trying to escape, the Siamese twinship of the old
   and the new man, and maintaining the unity of the ego before and after
   regeneration, we should not begin to teach that regeneration leaves our
   person unchanged, that it does not affect the sinner himself, but
   merely translates him into the sphere of an extraneous righteousness.
   No: the Scripture speaks of a new creature, another birth, a being
   changed and renewed. And this can not be reconciled with the notion
   that the sinner should remain unchanged.

   Regarding the question, what it is in the bud that has the potency to
   regenerate the wild trunk, the best-informed botanist can not discover
   the fiber or liquid that might have this power. He only knows that
   every bud has its own nature, and possesses the potency to produce
   another branch or tree of the same nature by its own formative power.

   And this applies to the work of regeneration. In the center of our
   being, ego, personality rules our nature, disposition, form of being,
   and existence, imparting its impress, form, character, and spiritual
   quality to what we are and work and speak. That all-controlling center
   is by nature sinful and wicked. Under its fairest forms it is but
   unrighteous. Hence, willingly or unwillingly, we press upon our being,
   working, and speaking the stamp of unrighteousness. According to age
   and development this nature of the ego chisels out of the marble of our
   being an evil and sinful man, corresponding to the image contained in
   our nature from which it proceeds. In regeneration God performs in this
   controlling center of our being a wonderful act, converting this
   nature, this formative force into something entirely different.
   Consequently our being, working, and speaking are henceforth controlled
   by another commandment, law of life, and government; and this new
   formative force chisels another man in us, new and holy, a child of
   God, created in righteousness.

   But this change is not completed at once. The tree grafted in March may
   remain inactive during that entire month, because, there is as yet no
   working in its nature. But this is sure: as soon as there is any action
   it will be according to the new, ingrafted nature.

   And so it is here. The new, ingrafted life may lie dormant for a
   season, like a grain of wheat in the earth; but when it begins to work
   it will be according to the nature of the new life. Hence regeneration
   implants the life-germ of the new man, whom it contains in all his
   completeness, and from which it will proceed as surely as the wheat
   contained in the seed proceeds from it.

   In order to assist us in our representation of this mystery, the
   greatest theologian of the Reformed churches has presented the divine
   plan in regeneration in the following stages:

   (1) In His own mind God conceives the new man; whom (2) He modifies
   according to a particular person, thus creating the new man; (3) He
   brings the germ of this new man into the center of our being; (4) in
   which center He effects the union between our ego and this germinating
   life; (5) in that vital germ God supports the formative power, which at
   His appointed time He will cause to come forth, by which our ego will
   manifest itself as a new man.

  Regeneration and Faith.

   "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
   the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever."--1 Peter i. 23.

   There is a possible objection to what has been said above concerning
   regeneration. It is evident that God's Word, and therefore our symbols
   of faith, offers a modified representation of these things which,
   superficially considered, seems to condemn our representation. This
   representation, which does not consider children, but adults, may thus
   be stated: Among a circle of unconverted persons God causes the Word to
   be preached by His ambassadors of the cross. By this preaching the call
   reaches them. If there are elect persons among them, for whom it is now
   the time of love, God accompanies the outward call with the inward.
   Consequently they turn from their ways of sin to the way of life. And
   so they are begotten of God.

   Thus St. Peter presents the matter, saying: "Being born again, not of
   corruptible seed, but of incorruptible; by the Word of God, which
   liveth and abideth forever." (1 Pet. i. 23) And also St. Paul when he
   declares, "That faith is by the hearing, and the hearing by the Word of
   God" (Rom. x. 17). It fully harmonizes with what St. Paul writes
   concerning holy Baptism, which he calls the washing of "regeneration,"
   for in those days Jew and Gentile were baptized in the name of the Lord
   Jesus, immediately after their conversion, by the preaching of the
   apostles.

   For this reason our fathers confessed in their Confession (article 24):
   "We believe that this true faith, being wrought in man by the hearing
   of the word of God, and the operation of the Holy Ghost, doth
   regenerate and make him a new man." And likewise teaches the Heidelberg
   Catechism (see question 65): "Such faith proceedeth from the Holy
   Ghost, who works faith in our hearts by the preaching of the Gospel,
   and confirms it by the use of the sacraments." And also the canons of
   Dort, Third and Fourth Heads of doctrine, section 17: "As the almighty
   operation of God, whereby He prolongs and supports this our natural
   life, does not exclude, but requires the use of means by which God of
   His infinite mercy and goodness hath chosen to exert His influence; so
   also the before-mentioned supernatural operation of God, by which we
   are regenerated, in no wise excludes or subverts the use of the Gospel;
   which the most wise God hath ordained to be the seed of regeneration
   and food of the soul. Wherefore, as the apostles and the teachers who
   succeeded them piously instructed the people concerning this grace of
   God, to His glory and the abasement of all pride, and in the mean time,
   however, neglected not to keep them by the sacred precepts of the
   Gospel in the exercise of the Word, the sacraments, and discipline; so
   even to this day, be it far from either instructors or instructed to
   presume to tempt God in the Church, by separating what He of His good
   pleasure hath most intimately joined together. For grace is conferred
   by means of admonitions; and the more readily we perform our duty, the
   more eminent usually is this blessing of God working in us, and the
   more directly is His work advanced."

   And now, in order to eradicate every suspicion that we contend against
   this representation, we declare openly and definitely that we give it
   our most hearty assent.

   We only beg it be considered that in this presentation both Scripture
   and the symbols of faith always point to the mysterious background, to
   a wonderful work of God hiding back of it, to an inscrutable mystery
   without which all this comes to naught.

   The canons of Dort describe this mysterious, inscrutable, and wonderful
   background most elaborately and most beautifully in article 12, Third
   and Fourth Heads of Doctrine: "And this is the regeneration so highly
   celebrated in Scripture and denominated a new creation; a resurrection
   from the dead, a making alive, which God works in us without our aid.
   But this is in no wise effected merely by the external preaching of the
   Gospel, by moral suasion, or such a mode of operation that, after God
   has performed His part, it still remains in the power of man to be
   regenerated or not; to be converted or to continue unconverted; but it
   is evidently a supernatural work, most powerful and at the same time
   most delightful, astonishing, mysterious, and ineffable; not inferior
   in efficacy to creation or the resurrection from the dead, as the
   Scripture inspired by the Author of this work declares; so that all in
   whose hearts God works in this marvelous manner are certainly,
   infallibly, and effectually regenerated, and do actually believe.
   Whereupon the will thus renewed is not only actuated and influenced by
   God, but in consequence of this influence becomes itself active.
   Wherefore, also, man is himself rightly said to believe and repent, by
   virtue of that grace received." And also in article 11: "But when God
   accomplishes His good pleasure in the elect, or works in them true
   conversion, He not only causes the Gospel to be externally preached to
   them, and powerfully illuminates their minds by His Holy Spirit, that
   they may rightly understand and discern the things of the Spirit of
   God; but by the efficacy of the same regenerating Spirit, He pervades
   the inmost recesses of the man; He opens the closed and softens the
   hardened heart, and circumcises that which was uncircumcised; infuses
   new qualities into the will, which, tho heretofore dead, He quickens;
   from being evil, disobedient, and refractory, He renders it good,
   obedient, and pliable; actuates and strengthens it, that like a good
   tree it may bring forth the fruits of good actions." The Heidelberg
   Catechism points to this, in question 8: "Except we are regenerated by
   the Spirit of God." And also the Confession, article 22: "We believe
   that to attain the true knowledge of this great mystery, the Holy
   Spirit kindleth in our hearts an upright faith, which embraces Jesus
   Christ with all His merits."

   This mysterious background, which our fathers at Dort called "His
   pervading the inmost recesses of man by the efficacy of the,
   regenerating Spirit," is evidently the same as what we call "the divine
   operation which penetrates the center of our being to implant the germ
   of the new life."

   And what is this mysterious working? According to the universal
   testimony based upon Scripture, it is an operation of the Holy Spirit
   in man's innermost being.

   Hence the question, whether this regenerating act precedes,
   accompanies, or follows the hearing of the Word. And this question
   should be well understood, for it involves the solution of this seeming
   disagreement.

   We answer: The Holy Spirit may perform this work in the sinner's heart
   before, during, or after the preaching of the Word. The inward call may
   be associated with the outward call, or it may follow it. But that
   which precedes the inward call, viz., the opening of the deaf ear, so
   that it may be heard, is not dependent upon the preaching of the Word;
   and therefore may precede the preaching.

   Correct discrimination in this respect is of greatest importance.

   If I designate the whole conscious work of grace from conversion until
   death, "regeneration," without any regard to its mysterious background,
   then I may and must say with the Confession (article 24): "That this
   faith, being wrought in man by the hearing of the Word, and the
   operation of the Holy Spirit, doth regenerate him and make him a new
   man."

   But if I distinguish in this work of grace, according to the claims of
   the sacraments, between the origin of the new life, for which God gave
   us the sacrament of holy Baptism, and its support, for which God gave
   the sacrament of the holy Supper, then regeneration ceases immediately
   after man is born again, and that which follows is called
   "sanctification."

   And discriminating again between that which the Holy Spirit wrought in
   us consciously and unconsciously, then regeneration designates that
   which was wrought in us unconsciously, while conversion is the term we
   apply to the awakening of this implanted life in our consciousness.

   Hence God's work of grace runs through these three successive stages:

   1st. Regeneration in its first stage, when the Lord plants the new life
   in the dead heart.

   2d. Regeneration in its second stage, when the new-born man comes to
   conversion.

   3d. Regeneration in its third stage, when conversion merges into
   sanctification.

   In each of these three God performs a wonderful and mysterious work in
   man's inward being. From God proceed quickening, conversion, and
   sanctification, and in each God is the Worker: only with this
   difference, that in the quickening He works alone, finding and leaving
   man inactive; that in conversion He finds us inactive, but makes us
   active; that in sanctification He works in us in such a manner that we
   work ourselves through Him.

   Describing it still more closely, we say that in the first stage of
   regeneration, that of quickening, God works without means; in the
   second stage, that of conversion, He employs means, viz., the preaching
   of the Word; and in the third stage, that of sanctification, He uses
   means in addition to ourselves, whom He uses as means.

   Condensing the foregoing, there is one great act of God which
   re-creates the corrupt sinner into a new man, viz., the comprehensive
   act of regeneration, which contains three parts--quickening,
   conversion, and sanctification.

   For the ministry of the Word it is preferable to consider only the last
   two, conversion and sanctification, since this is the appointed means
   to effect them. The first, regeneration, is preferably a subject of
   private meditation, since in it man is passive and God only active; and
   also because in it the majesty of the divine operation is most
   apparent.

   Hence there is no conflict or opposition. Referring, according to the
   Confession, article 17, only to conversion and sanctification, the
   unstopping of the deaf ear as preceding the hearing of the Word is not
   denied. And penetrating into the work which antedates conversion, "In
   which God works in us without our aid" (article 12 of the canons of
   Dort), it is not denied, but confessed, that conversion and
   sanctification follow the unstopping of the deaf ear, and that, in the
   proper sense, regeneration is completed only at the death of the
   sinner.

   Do not suppose that we make these two to conflict. In writing a
   biography of Napoleon it would be sufficient simply to mention his
   birth, but one might also mention, more in particular, the things that
   took place before his birth. Just so in this respect: I may refer
   either to the two parts of regeneration, conversion and sanctification,
   or I may include also that which precedes conversion, and speak also of
   the quickening. This implies no antagonism, but a mere difference of
   exactness. It is more exhaustive, with reference to regeneration, to
   speak of three stages--quickening, conversion, and sanctification;
   altho it is customary and more practical to speak only of the last two.

   Our purpose, however, calls for greater completeness. The aim of this
   work is not to preach the Word, but to uncover the foundations of the
   truth, so as to stop the building of crooked walls upon the
   foundation-stone, after the manner of Ethicals, Rationalists, and
   Supernaturalists.

   Exhaustiveness in treatment requires to ask not only, "How and what
   does the quickened sinner hear?" but also, "Who has given him hearing
   ears? "

   And this is all the more to be insisted upon because our children must
   not be ignored in this respect. At Dort, in 1618, our children were
   taken into account, and we may not deny ourselves this pleasant
   obligation.

   And herein lies a real danger. For to speak of the little ones without
   considering the first stage of regeneration--i.e., the
   quickening--causes confusion and perplexity from which there is no
   escape.

   Salvation depends upon faith, and faith upon the hearing of the Word;
   hence our deceased infants must be lost, for they can not hear the
   Word. To escape this fearful thought it is often said that the children
   are saved by virtue of the parents' faith--a misunderstanding which
   greatly confused our entire conception of Baptism, and made our
   baptismal form very perplexing. But as soon as we distinguish
   quickening, as a stage of regeneration, from conversion and
   sanctification, the light enters. For since quickening is an unaided
   act of God in us, independent of the Word, and frequently separated
   from the second stage, conversion, by an interval of many days, there
   is nothing to prevent God from performing His work even in the babe,
   and the apparent conflict dissolves into beautiful harmony. Moreover,
   as soon as I regard my still unconverted children as not yet
   regenerate, their training must run in the direction of a questionable
   Methodism. [28] What is the use of the call so long as I suppose and
   know: "This ear can not yet hear"?

   Touching the question concerning. "faith," we are fully prepared to
   apply the same distinction to this matter. You have only to
   discriminate between the organ or the faculty of faith, the Power to
   exercise faith, and the working of faith. The first of these three,
   viz., the faculty of faith, is implanted in the first stage of
   regeneration--i.e., in quickening; the power of faith is imparted in
   the second stage of regeneration--i.e., in conversion; and the working
   of faith is wrought in the third stage--i.e., in sanctification. Hence
   if faith is wrought only by the hearing of the Word, the preaching of
   the Word does not create the faculty of faith.

   Look only at what our fathers confessed at Dort: "He who works in man
   both to will and to do produces both the will to believe and the act of
   believing also" (Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine, article 14).

   Or to express it still more strongly: when the Word is preached, I know
   it; and when I hear it and believe it, I know whence this working of
   faith comes. But the implanting of the faith-faculty is an entirely
   different thing; for of this the Lord Jesus says: "Thou hearest the
   sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh; and whither it
   goeth"; [29] and as the wind, so is also the regeneration of man.

  Implanting in Christ.

   "Having become one plant with Him." --Rom. vi. 5.

   Having discussed regeneration as God's act wrought in a lost, wicked,
   and guilty sinner, we now examine the more sacred and delicate
   question: How does this divine act affect our relation to Christ?

   We consider this point more important than the first, since every view
   of regeneration that does not do full justice to the "mystical union
   with Christ" is anti-Scriptural, eradicates brotherly love, and begets
   spiritual pride.

   The holy apostle declares: "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,
   and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the
   Son of God." [30] [29] The idea that a saint can have life outside of
   the mystical union with Immanuel is but a fiction of the imagination.
   The regenerate can live no life but such as consists in union with
   Christ. Let this be firmly and strongly maintained.

   The Scriptural expressions, "one plant with Him" [30] and "branches of
   the Vine," which must be taken in their fullest significance, are
   metaphors entirely different from those which we use. We are confined
   to metaphors which express our meaning by analogy; but they can not be
   fully applied nor express the being of the thing; hence the so-called
   third term of the comparison. But the figures used by the Holy Spirit
   express a real conformity, a unity of thought divinely expressed in the
   spiritual and visible world. Hence Jesus could say: "I am the true
   Vine," [31] that is, "every other vine is but a figure. The true, the
   real Vine am I, and I alone."

   Being exceedingly sober and choice in His metaphorical speech, the Lord
   Jesus does not say that a branch is grafted into the vine, simply
   because this is not done in nature, i.e., in the creation of God. In
   John xv., Jesus does not even touch upon the question of how one
   becomes a branch. That is the work of the Father. My Father is the
   Husbandman. In John xv. 3 he speaks only of a person who not abiding in
   Him withers and will be burned.

   Even Rom. vi. 5 does not speak of coming to Jesus, and Rom. xi. 17-25
   only partly. The former calls it to become one plant with Him, but does
   not tell "how"; and "grafting" is not even mentioned. And the latter,
   speaking of broken olive-branches, and of wild olive-branches grafted
   upon a good olive, and lastly of broken branches restored to the
   original olive, makes no reference whatever to the implanting of
   individuals in Christ, as we will soon prove.

   And yet the figure is only partly applicable. Indeed, in Rom. xi., St.
   Paul, with his characteristic boldness of speech and style, for
   comparison's sake reverses God's work in nature; for while in reality
   the cultivated bud is grafted on the wild trunk, he makes in this
   instance the wild bud to be grafted upon the good trunk. A bold stroke
   indeed and very profitable to us, for by it he makes us see clearly and
   distinctly the general implanting in Christ. But that is all.

   For, notice it well, the figure is not to be pressed too far. It is a
   mistake to make it refer to the regeneration of the individual sinner.
   For a person once implanted in Christ can not be severed from Him: "No
   man can pluck them out of My hand"; [32] "Whom He has justified, them
   He also glorified." [33]

   And yet, reference is made here to branches which are broken off and
   which were grafted in again. If this referred to particular
   individuals, then the Jews, who during the life of St. Paul denied the
   Lord, must have been regenerate persons who fell away and returned
   again before they died.

   If this had been St. Paul's meaning, subsequent events would have
   belied his words, and he would have revoked the whole tenor of his
   other teachings. But he plainly means that the tribes of Israel, who
   were in the Covenant of Grace, had lost their position therein by their
   own fault; yet that even outside of the Covenant they should be
   preserved throughout the coming ages, and that in the course of history
   the way would be opened even for them to be reintroduced into the
   Covenant of Grace. And this shows that Rom. xi. 17-25 does not teach
   the regeneration of individual persons, and that the good olive does
   not signify Christ, for he that is implanted in Christ can never be
   severed from Him, and he that is severed from Him never belonged to
   Him. Do we not believe in the perseverance of saints?

   It may be objected that in John xv. reference is made to branches that
   are cast forth from the vine; to which we answer: first, that this does
   not remove the difficulty that the apostate Jews of St. Paul's time
   were never grafted in again; and second, that with Calvin we hold that
   Jesus, speaking of the branches cast forth, had reference to persons
   who, like Judas, seemed to be implanted; otherwise His own word, "No
   man can pluck them out of My hand," [34] can not stand for a moment.

   We arrive, therefore, at this conclusion, that neither John xv. nor
   Rom. xi. has any reference to personal regeneration in its limited
   sense; while Rom. vi., which speaks of becoming one plant, does not
   introduce the idea of ingrafting, nor make the slightest allusion to
   the manner in which this "becoming one plant" had been accomplished.

   It is unnecessary to say that not a few exegetes judge the translation,
   "One plant with Him," incorrect, omitting the words italicized. We do
   not express here an opinion regarding this rendering; but it shows
   clearly that Rom. vi. has nothing to say concerning the manner in which
   our union with Christ is effected.

   In fact, Scripture never applies the figure of grafting to
   regeneration. Rom. xi. treats of the restoration of a people and nation
   to the covenant of grace; Rom. vi. speaks only of a most intimate
   union; and John xv. never alludes to a wild branch which became good by
   being planted in Christ. These figures set forth the union with Christ,
   but teach nothing concerning the manner in which this union is
   effected. Scripture is utterly silent concerning it; and since there is
   no other source of information, mere human inventions are utterly
   useless. Even Christian experience does not throw any light upon it,
   for it can not teach anything which Scripture has not taught already;
   and again, we can easily perceive the union with Christ where it
   exists, but we can not see it where it does not exist, or where it is
   just forming.

   And yet this union with Christ must be strongly emphasized. The
   theologians who represent divine truth most purely lay most stress upon
   this matter. And altho Calvin may have been the most rigid among the
   reformers, yet not one of them has presented this, unio mystica, this
   spiritual union with Christ, so incessantly, so tenderly, and with such
   holy fire as he. And as Calvin, so did all the Reformed theologians,
   from Beza to Comrie, and from Zanchius to KÃ¶hlbrugge. "Without Christ
   nothing, by this mystical union with Christ all," was their motto. And
   even now a preacher's value is to be strictly measured by the degree of
   prominence, accorded to the mystical union with Immanuel, in his
   presentation of the truth. The strong utterance of KÃ¶hlbrugge, "One may
   be born again, one may be a child of God, one may be a sincere
   believer, yet without this mystical union with Christ he is nothing in
   himself, nothing but a lost and wicked sinner," was always the glorious
   confession of our churches. In fact, it is what our form for the
   administration of the Lord's Supper so well expresses: "Considering
   that we seek our life outside of ourselves in Jesus Christ, we
   acknowledge that we lie in the midst of death."

   But it is wrong on this ground to teach--as some of our younger
   ministers are reported to teach--and derogatory to the work of the Holy
   Spirit, that regeneration accomplishes nothing in us, and that the
   whole work is performed completely outside of us as some have said,
   "That we need not even be converted, for even that has been done for us
   vicariously by the Lord Jesus Christ." To say that there is no
   difference between a regenerate person and an unregenerate is to
   contradict Scripture and to deny the work of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore
   we strongly oppose this notion. There is indeed a difference. The
   former has entered into the union with Christ, and the latter has not.
   And upon this union everything depends; it makes a difference in men,
   as between heaven and hell.

   Nor may it be said, on the contrary, "That a regenerate person, even
   without the union with Christ, is other or better than an unbeliever";
   for this puts asunder what God has joined together. Outside of Christ
   there is in man born of a woman nothing but darkness, corruption, and
   death.

   Hence we firmly maintain the indissoluble oneness of these two: "There
   is no regeneration without establishing, the mystical union with
   Christ"; and again: "There is no mystical union with Immanuel but in
   the regenerate." These two may never be separated; and on the long way
   between the first act of regeneration and completed sanctification, the
   unio mystica may not for a moment be lost sight of.

   The Ethical theologians will probably assent to all that we have said
   on this subject; and yet, according to our deepest conviction, they
   have wholly bastardized and misapprehended this precious article of
   faith. Assuredly they strongly emphasize the union with Christ; they
   even tell us that they do this more than we, maintaining that it is
   immaterial whether a man is sound in the Scripture or not so long as he
   is united with Christ. In that case there is no more need of any
   formula, confession, articles of faith, or even faith in the Scripture.
   A prominent Ethical professor at the University of Utrecht has openly
   declared: "Altho I should lose the entire Scripture, yea, tho the truth
   of not one of the Gospel narratives could be verified, I would not be
   in the least affected, for I would still possess union with Christ; and
   having that, what more can a man desire?" And this has such a pious
   ring, and taken in the abstract is so true, that many a conscience must
   agree with it, not having the faintest suspicion of the apostasy from
   the faith of the fathers contained in it.

   If one should ask us whether we do not believe that the soul united
   with Jesus possesses all that can be desired, we would almost refuse an
   answer, for he knows better. No, indeed, favored soul, having that you
   need no more; depart in peace, thrice blessed of God.

   But because the mystical union with the Son of God is so weighty and
   precious an article of faith, we desire that every man should treat it
   most seriously, and examine whether the union which he says he
   possesses is actually the same mystical union with the Lord Jesus
   Christ which the Scripture, promises to the children of God, and which
   they have enjoyed throughout the ages.

  Not a Divine-Human Nature.

   "I in them, and they in Me."
   --John xvii. 23.

   The union of believers with the Mediator, of all matters of faith the
   most tender, is invisible, imperceptible to the senses, and
   unfathomable; it escapes all inward vision; it refuses to be dissected
   or to be made objective by any representation; in the fullest sense of
   the word it is mystical--unio mystica, as Calvin, after the example of
   the early Church, called it.

   And yet, however mysterious, no man is at liberty to interpret it
   according to his own notions; in fact, there is need of great vigilance
   lest under the pious appearance of this mystic love injurious
   contraband be smuggled into the divine sanctuary. We have therefore
   raised our voice against the false representations of former mystical
   sects, and of the Ethical theorists of the present time.

   Let us first explain the Ethical teaching on this point.

   Their belief starts from the antithesis existing between God and man.
   God is the Creator, man is a creature. God is infinite, man finite. God
   dwells in the eternal, and man lives in the temporal. God is holy, and
   man is unholy; etc. So long as these contrasts exist, so they teach,
   there can be no unity, no reconciliation, no harmony. And as the
   pantheistic philosophy used to talk about three stages through which
   life must run its course--first, that of proposition (thesis), then
   that of contrast (antithesis), and lastly, that of reconciliation,
   combination (synthesis)--so the Ethicals teach that between God and man
   there exist these three: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.

   In the first place, there is God. This is the thesis, the proposition.
   Opposed to this thesis in God, the antithesis, contrast, appears in
   man. And this thesis and antithesis find their reconciliation,
   synthesis, in the Mediator, who is at once finite and infinite,
   burdened with our guilt and holy, temporal, and eternal.

   It is only recently that we quoted the following sentence from
   Professor Gunning's little book, "The Mediator between God and Man"
   (page 28): "Jesus Christ is the Mediator equally between the Jews and
   the Gentiles; and also between all things that need reconciliation and
   mediation; as between God and man, spirit and body, heaven and earth,
   time and eternity."

   This representation contains the fundamental error of the Ethical
   theology. It interferes with the boundaries which God has set. It
   effaces them. It causes all contrasts finally to disappear. And by this
   very thing, without intending it, it becomes the instrument of
   spreading the pantheism of the philosophic school. Not understanding
   this system, one may be deeply in love with it. This pantheistic
   ferment is deeply seated in our sinful hearts. The waters of pantheism
   are sweet, their religious flavor is peculiarly pleasant. There is
   spiritual intoxication in this cup, and once inebriated the soul has
   lost its desire for the sober clearness of the divine Word. To escape
   from the witchery of these pantheistic charms, one needs to be aroused
   by bitter experience. And once awakened, the soul is alarmed at the
   fearful danger to which this siren had exposed it.

   No; the contrast between God and man must not cease; the contrast
   between heaven and earth may not be placed upon the same line with that
   of Jew and Gentile; the contrast between the infinite and finite must
   not be effaced by the Mediator; time and eternity must not be made
   identical. There must be brought about a reconciliation for the sinner.
   That is all, and no more. "To bring about reconciliation" is the work
   assigned to the Mediator, and that alone. And this reconciliation is
   not between time and eternity, the finite and the infinite, but
   exclusively between a sinful creature and a holy Creator. It is a
   reconciliation that could not have occurred if man had not fallen,
   necessitated only by his fall; a reconciliation not essential to the
   being of Christ, but His per accidens, i.e., by something independent
   of His being.

   And since the essence of true godliness is based not in the removal of
   the divinely appointed boundaries and contrasts, but in a deep
   reverence for the same; and on this ground the creature as
   distinguished from the Creator may not feel himself one with, but
   absolutely distinct from Him, it is clear that this error of the
   Ethicals affects the essence of godliness.

   The early Church discovered this same principle in Origen, and
   subsequently in Eutychus; and our fathers of the last century found it
   in the Hernhutters and sharply opposed it. And only because we lack
   knowledge and penetration have these Ethical doctrines been able to
   spread so rapidly here, in Germany, in Switzerland and even in
   Scotland, their pantheistic tendencies undetected.

   And how does this evil affect their Christology? It affects it to such
   extent that it is entirely different from that of the Reformed
   churches. Tho they tell us; "We disagree in our views on the
   Scriptures, but agree in our confession of Christ," yet this is
   absolutely untrue. Their Christ is not the Christ of the Reformed
   churches. Christ, as the Reformed Church according to the Scripture and
   the orthodox Church of all ages confesses Him, is the Son of God,
   eternal Partaker of the divine nature, who in time, in addition to the
   divine nature, adopted the human nature, uniting these two natures in
   the unity of one person. He unites them in such a way, however, that
   these natures continue each by itself, do not blend, and do not
   communicate the attributes of the one to the other. Hence two natures
   are united most intimately in the unity of one person, but continuing
   to the end, and even now in heaven, to be two natures each with its own
   peculiar properties. "He is one not by conversion of the Godhead into
   flesh, but by taking of the manhood into God" (Confession of
   Athanasius, article 35). And again: "He is one not by mixture of
   substance, but by unity of person" (article 36).

   In like manner do we confess in article 19 of our Confession: "We
   believe that by this conception the person of the Son is inseparably
   united and connected with the human nature; so that there are not two
   Sons of God, nor two persons, but two natures united in one single
   person; yet each nature retains its own distinct properties. As then
   the divine nature has always remained uncreated, without beginning of
   days or end of life, filling heaven and earth; so also hath the human
   nature not lost its properties, but remained a creature, having
   beginning of days, being a finite nature, and retaining all the
   properties of a real body. And tho He hath by His Resurrection given
   immortality to the same, nevertheless He hath not changed the reality
   of His human nature; forasmuch as our salvation and resurrection also
   depend on the reality of His body. But these two natures were so
   closely united in one person that they were not separated even by His
   death:"

   This clear confession, which the orthodox Church has always defended
   against the Eutychians and Monothelites, and which our Reformed
   churches in particular have maintained in opposition to the Lutherans
   and Mystics, is opposed by the Ethical view all along the line. The
   late Prof. Chantepie de la Saussaye said distinctly in his Inaugural
   that it was impossible to maintain the old representation on this
   point, which was also upheld by our Confession: and that his confession
   of the Mediator was another. Hence the Ethical wing deviates from the
   old paths not only in the matter of the Scripture, but also in the
   confession of the person of the Redeemer. It teaches what the Reformed
   churches have always denied, and denies what the Reformed churches have
   always maintained in opposition to churches less correct in their
   views.

   Under the influence which Schleiermacher's training among the Moravian
   brethren, and his pantheistic development and Lutheran dogmatics, have
   exerted upon the Ethicals, a Christ is preached by them who is not the
   Christ to whom the orthodox Church of all ages has bowed the knee; and
   whose confession has always been preserved incorrupt by the Reformed,
   and especially by our national, theologians. For their conclusions are
   as follows:

   1st. That the Incarnation of the Son of God would have taken place even
   if Adam had not sinned.

   2d. That He is Mediator not only between the sinner and the holy God,
   but also between the finite and the infinite.

   3d. That the two natures mix together, and communicate their attributes
   to each other in such a measure that from Him, who is both God and man,
   there proceeds that which is divine-human.

   4th. That this divine-human nature is communicated to believers also.

   This error is immediately recognized by the use of the word
   divine-human. Not that we condemn its use in every instance. On the
   contrary, when it refers not to the natures, but to the person, its use
   is legitimate, for in the one person the two natures are inseparably
   united. Still it is better in our days to be chary of the word.
   Divine-human has in the present time a pantheistic meaning, denoting
   that the contrast existing between God and man did not exist in Jesus,
   but that in Him the antithesis of the divine and the human was not
   found.

   And this is wholly anti-Scriptural, and results in its final
   consequences in a pure theosophy. For the actual result is a blending
   of the two natures: a divine nature in God, a human nature in man, and
   a divine-human nature in the Mediator. So that if man had not fallen,
   the Mediator would nevertheless have appeared in a divine-human nature.

   This is a truly abhorrent doctrine. It puts in the place of the Savior
   from our sins another and entirely different person; the contrasts
   between the Creator and the creature disappear; the divine-human nature
   of the Christ is actually placed above the divine nature itself. For
   the Mediator in the divine-human nature, possesses something that is
   lacking in the divine nature, viz., its reconciliation with the human.

   This shows how much further the Ethicals have departed from the pure
   confession of the Lord Jesus Christ than is generally believed.
   According to them there is in the Person of the Mediator a kind of new
   nature, a kind of third nature, a kind of higher nature, which is
   called "human-divine." And the union with Christ is found (not
   subjectively, but objectively) in the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ
   pours into us that new, third, higher kind, viz., the divine-human
   nature. Hence the regenerate are the persons who have received this
   new, third, higher kind of nature. This has no connection with sin, but
   would have appeared even in the absence of sin. The reconciliation of
   sinners is something additional, and does not touch the root of the
   matter.

   The real and principal thing is, that the Mediator between the "finite
   and the infinite" (to use the very words of Professor Gunning) imparts
   unto us, who have the lower, human nature, this new, third, higher,
   divine-human nature.

   Not that the human nature is to be removed, and the divine-human nature
   take its place. No, indeed; but, according to the Ethical theologians,
   the human nature is originally intended and destined to be thus
   ennobled, refined, and exalted. As the slip of a plant, under the
   influence of the sun, develops and produces by and by choice flowers,
   so does the human nature develop and unfold itself under the influence
   of the Sun of Righteousness into this higher nature.

   That this must be accomplished by means of regeneration is on account
   of sin. If there had been no fall in Paradise, and no sin after the
   fall, there would have been no regeneration, and our nature's lower
   degree would have passed over spontaneously into that higher,
   divine-human nature. And this is, in the circles of the Ethicals, the
   basis of that much-lauded unio mystica with the Christ.

   The invisible church is, according to their view, that circle of men
   into whom this higher and nobler tincture of life has been instilled,
   and others not so favored still stand without. Hence their lack of
   appreciation of the visible churches; for does not the divine-human
   tincture of life determine this circle of itself? Hence their
   preference for the "unconscious"; conscious confession and expression
   of thought is immaterial; the principal thing is to be endowed with
   this new, higher, more refined, divine-human nature. This explains
   their generally lofty bearing toward men not sharing their opinions.
   They belong to a sort of spiritual aristocracy; they are of nobler
   descent, acquainted with more refined forms, living a higher life, from
   which with pitying eyes they look down upon those who do not dream
   their dreams of the higher life-tincture.

   Let it suffice here only to say that the Reformed churches can not
   indorse this representation of the unio mystica, but must positively
   reject it.

  XXVI.

  The Mystical Union with Immanuel.

   "Christ in you the hope of glory." --Col. i. 27.

   The union of believers with Christ their Head is not effected by
   instilling a divine-human life-tincture into the soul. There is no
   divine-human life. There is a most holy Person, who unites in Himself
   the divine and the human life; but both natures continue unmixed,
   unblended, each retaining its own properties. And since there is no
   divine-human life in Jesus, He can not instil it into us.

   We do heartily acknowledge that there is a certain conformity and
   similarity between the divine nature and the human, for man was created
   after the image of God; wherefore St. Peter could say, "That we become
   partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter i. 4); but, according to all
   sound expositors, this means only that unto the sinner are imparted the
   attributes of goodness and holiness, which he originally possessed in
   his own nature in common with the divine nature, but which he lost by
   sin.

   Compared with the nature of material things, and with that of animals
   and of devils, there is indeed a feature of conformity and similarity
   between the divine and human natures. But this may not be understood as
   obliterating the boundary between the divine nature and the human. And,
   therefore, let this glorious word of St. Peter no longer be abused in
   order to justify a philosophic system which has nothing in common with
   the soberness and simplicity of Holy Scripture.

   What St. Peter calls "to become partaker of the divine nature" is
   called in another place, to become the children of God. But altho
   Christ is the Son of God, and we are called the children of God, this
   does not make the Sonship of Christ and our sonship to stand on the
   same plane and to be of the same nature. We are but the adopted
   children, altho we have another descent, while He is the actual and
   eternal Son. While He is essentially the eternal Son, partaker of the
   divine nature, which in the unity of His Person He unites with the
   human nature, we are merely restored to the likeness of the divine
   nature which we had lost by sin.

   Hence as "to be adopted as a child," and "to be the Son forever" are
   contrasts, so are also the following: "to have the divine nature in
   Himself," and "to be only partakers of the divine nature."

   The friend who shares a bereaved mother's mourning is not bereaved
   himself, but through love and pity he has become partaker of that
   mourning. In like manner, accepting these great and precious promises,
   believers become partakers of the divine nature, altho in themselves
   wholly devoid, of that nature. Partaker does not denote what one
   possesses in himself, as his own, but a partial communication of what
   does not belong to him, but to another.

   Hence this glorious, apostolic word should no longer be used in
   pantheistic sense. As it is unlawful to say that we are the essential
   children of God, but must humbly confess, through Christ, to be His
   adopted children, so it is not lawful to say that by faith we become in
   ourselves bearers of the divine nature; but we must be satisfied with
   the confession that through the fellowship of love, God makes us
   partakers of the vital emotions of the divine nature, so far as our
   human capacities are able to experience them.

   This brings us back to the unio mystica with Christ, which, altho a
   great and impenetrable mystery, ought to be sufficiently defined to
   keep us from falling into error. We mention, therefore, its vital
   points and thus embody our confession concerning it:

   1st. The first point is, that the Lord Jesus does not require us to be
   purified and sanctified in order to be united to His Person.

   Jesus is a Savior not of the righteous, but of sinners. And for this
   reason He has adopted the human nature: not as the Baptist teaches, by
   receiving from heaven a newly created body, like the Paradise body of
   Adam, but by becoming partaker, as the little children, of our flesh
   and blood. And the same is true of His union with believers. He does
   not wait until they are pure and holy, then to be spiritually betrothed
   unto them; but He betroths Himself unto them that they may become pure
   and holy. He is the rich Bridegroom, and the soul the poverty-stricken
   bride. In the shining robes of His righteousness He comes and, finding
   her black, unsightly, and in her native defilement, He says not, "Get
   thyself clean, wise, and rich, and as a rich bride I will betroth thee
   unto Me"; but, "I take thee just as thou art. I say unto thee, in thy
   blood, Live. Tho thou art poor, betrothing thee, I will make thee
   partaker of Myself and of My treasure. But a treasure of thine own thou
   shalt never possess."

   This point should be firmly established. The Lord Jesus unites unto
   Himself not the righteous, but sinners. He marries not the pure and the
   spotless, but the polluted and the unclean.

   When the holy apostle Paul speaks of a bride whom he will present
   without spot or wrinkle, he has reference to something entirely
   different not to His betrothal with the individual, but to the marriage
   of the Lord Jesus with His Church as a whole. So long as the Church
   continues in the earth, separated from Him, she is His bride, until in
   the fulness of time, the separation ended, He will introduce her to the
   rich and full communion of the united life in glory.

   2d. The second point to which we call attention is the time when this
   union begins.

   To say that this unio mystica is the result of faith alone is only
   partly correct. For Scripture teaches very distinctly that we were
   already in the Lord Jesus when He died on Calvary, and when He arose
   from the dead; that we ascended with Him unto heaven; and that for
   eighteen centuries we have been seated with Him at the right hand of
   God. Hence we must carefully distinguish between the five stages in
   which the union with Immanuel unfolds itself:

   The first of these five stages lies in the decree of God. From the very
   moment that the Father gave us to the Son, we were really His own, and
   a relation was established between Him and us, not weak and feeble, but
   so deep and extensive that all subsequent relations with Immanuel
   spring from this fundamental root-relation alone.

   The second stage is in the Incarnation, when, adopting our flesh,
   entering into our nature, He made that preexisting, essential relation
   actual; when the bond of union passed from the divine will, i.e., from
   the decree, into actual existence. Christ in the flesh carries all
   believers in the loins of His grace, as Adam carried all the children
   of men in the loins of his flesh. Hence, not figuratively nor
   metaphorically, but in the proper sense, Scripture teaches that when
   Jesus died and arose we died and arose with Him and in Him.

   The third stage begins when we ourselves appear not in our birth, but
   in our regeneration; when the Lord God begins to work supernaturally in
   our souls; when in love's hour Eternal Love conceives in us the child
   of God. Until then the mystic union was hid in the decree and in the
   Mediator; but in and by regeneration the person appears with whom the
   Lord Jesus will establish it. However, not regeneration first and then
   something new; viz., union with Christ, but in the very moment of
   completed regeneration that union becomes an internally accomplished
   fact.

   This third stage must be carefully distinguished from the fourth, which
   begins not with the quickening, but with the first conscious exercise
   of faith. For, altho in regeneration the faculty of faith was
   implanted, it may for a long time remain inactive; and only when the
   Holy Spirit causes it to act, producing genuine faith and conversion in
   us, is the union with Christ established subjectively.

   This union is not the subsequent fruit of a higher degree of holiness,
   but coincides with the first exercise of faith. Faith which does not
   live in Christ is no faith, but its counterfeit. Genuine faith is
   wrought in us by the Holy Ghost, and all that He imparts to us He draws
   from Christ. Hence there may be an apparent or pretended faith without
   the union with Christ, but not a real faith. Wherefore it is an assured
   fact that the first sigh of the soul, in its first exercise of faith,
   is the result of the wonderful union of the soul with its Surety.

   We do not deny, however, that there is a gradual increase of the
   conscious realization, of the lively feeling, and of the free enjoyment
   of this union. A child possesses its mother from the first moment of
   its existence: but the sensible enjoyment of its mother's love
   gradually awakens and increases with the years, until he fully knows
   what a treasure God has given him in his mother. And thus the
   consciousness and enjoyment of what we have in our Savior becomes
   gradually clearer and deeper, until there comes a moment when we fully
   realize how rich God has made us in Jesus. And by this many are led to
   think that their union with Christ dates from that moment. This is only
   apparently so. Altho then they became fully conscious of their treasure
   in Christ, the union itself existed (even subjectively) from the moment
   of their first cry of faith.

   This leads to the fifth and last stage, viz., death. Rejoicing in Him
   with joy unspeakable and full of glory, altho not seeing Him, much more
   remains to be desired. Hence our union with Him does not attain its
   fullest unfolding until every lack be supplied and we see Him as He is;
   and in that blissful vision we shall be like Him, for then He will give
   us all that He has. Therefore faith makes us partakers first of Himself
   and then of all His gifts, as the Heidelberg Catechism clearly teaches.

   3d. The third point to which we call attention is the nature of this
   union with Immanuel.

   It has a nature peculiar to itself; it may be compared to other unions,
   but it can never be fully explained by them. Wonderful is the bond
   between body and soul; more wonderful still the sacramental bond of
   holy Baptism and the Lord's Supper; equally wonderful the vital union
   between mother and child in her blood, like that of the vine and its
   growing branches; wonderful the bond of wedlock; and much more
   wonderful the union with the Holy Spirit, established by His
   indwelling. But the union with Immanuel is distinct from all these.

   It is a union invisible and intangible; the ear fails to perceive it,
   and it eludes all investigation; yet it is very real union and
   communion, by which the life of the Lord Jesus directly affects and
   controls us. As the unborn babe lives on the mother-blood, which has
   its heart-beat outside of him, so we also live on the Christ-life,
   which has its heart-beat not in our soul, but outside of us, in heaven
   above, in Christ Jesus.

   4th. In the fourth place, altho the union with Christ coincides with
   our covenant-relation to Him as the Head, yet it is not identical with
   it. Our relations of fellowship to Christ are many. There is a
   fellowship of feeling and inclination, of love and attachment; we are
   disciples of the Prophet; we are His blood--bought possession; the
   subjects of the King; and members of the Covenant of Grace of which He
   is the Head. But instead of absorbing the "unio mystica," they are all
   based upon it. Without this real bond all the others are only
   imaginary. Hence, while we know, feel, and confess that it is glorious
   to be safely hid in our Covenant-Head, it is sweeter, more precious and
   delightful to live in the mystical fellowship of Love.

CALLING AND REPENTANCE.

  XXVII.

  The Calling of the Regenerate:

   "Whom He did predestinate, them He also called."--Rom. viii. 30.

   In order to hear, the sinner, deaf by nature, must receive hearing
   ears. "He that hath ears let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
   churches." (Rev. ii. 7, 11, 17, 29; iii. 6, 13, 22).

   But by nature the sinner does not belong to these favored ones. This is
   a daily experience. Of two clerks in the same office, one obeys the
   call and the other rejects it; not because he despises it, but because
   he does not hear God's call in it. Hence God's quickening act antedates
   the sinner's hearing; and thus he becomes able to hear the Word.

   The quickening, the implanting of the faith-faculty, and the uniting of
   the soul to Christ, apparently three acts, are in reality but one act,
   together constituting (objectively) the so-called first grace. In the
   operation of this grace the sinner is perfectly passive and
   indifferent; the subject of an action which does not involve the
   slightest operation, yielding, or even non-resistance on his part.

   In fact, the sinner, being dead in trespasses and sins, is under this
   first grace like a soulless, motionless body, with all the passive
   properties belonging to a corpse. This fact can not be stated with
   sufficient force and emphasis. It is an absolute passivity. And every
   effort or inclination to claim for the sinner the minutest cooperation
   in this first grace destroys the Gospel, severs the artery of the
   Christian confession, and is not only heretical, but anti-Scriptural in
   the highest sense.

   This is the point where the sign-post is erected; where the roads
   divide, where the men of the purified, that is, the Reformed
   Confession, part company with their opponents.

   Having stated this fact forcibly and definitely, it is of the utmost
   importance to state with equal emphasis that, in all the subsequent
   operations of grace (so-called second grace), this absolute passivity
   is made to cease by the wonderful act of the first grace. Hence in all
   subsequent grace the sinner to some extent cooperates.

   In the first grace the sinner is absolutely like a corpse. But the
   sinner's first passivity and his subsequent cooperation must not be
   confounded. There is a passivity, after the Scripture, which can not be
   exaggerated, which must be left intact; but there is also a passivity
   which is pretended, anti-Scriptural, and sinful. The difference between
   the two is not that the former is partially cooperating, and the latter
   without any cooperation whatever. Surely by such temporizing the
   churches and the souls in them are not inspired with energy and
   enthusiasm. No; the difference between the sound and the sickly
   passivity consists herein, that the former, which is absolute and
   unlimited, belongs to the first grace, to which it is indispensable;
   while the latter clings to the second grace, where it does not belong.

   Let there be clear insight into this truth, which is after all very
   simple. The elect but unregenerate sinner can do nothing, and the work
   that is to be wrought in him must be wrought by another: This is the
   first grace. But after this is accomplished he is no longer passive,
   for something was brought into him which in the second work of grace
   will cooperate with God.

   But it is not implied that the elect and regenerate sinner is now able
   to do anything without God; or that if God should cease working in him,
   conversion and sanctification would follow of themselves. Both these
   representations are thoroughly untrue, un-Reformed, and unchristian,
   because they detract from the work of the Holy Spirit in the elect. No;
   all spiritual good is of grace to the end: grace not only in
   regeneration, but at every step of the way of life. From the beginning
   to the end and throughout eternity the Holy Spirit is the Worker, of
   regeneration and conversion, of justification and every part of
   sanctification, of glorification, and of all the bliss of the redeemed.
   Nothing may be subtracted from this.

   But while the Holy Spirit is the only Worker in the first grace, in all
   subsequent, operations of grace the regenerate always cooperates with
   Him. Hence it is not true, as some say, that the regenerate is just as
   passive as the unregenerate; this only detracts from the work of the
   Holy Spirit in the first grace. Neither is it true that henceforth the
   regenerate is the principal worker, only assisted by the Holy Spirit;
   for this is equally derogatory to the Spirit's work in the second
   grace.

   Both these errors should be opposed and rejected. For altho, on the one
   hand, it is said that the regenerate, considered out of Christ, still
   lies in the midst of death; yet, tho he be considered a thousand times
   out of Christ, he remains in Him, for once in His hand no one can pluck
   him out of it. And altho, on the other hand, the regenerate is
   constantly admonished to be active and diligent, yet, tho the horse
   does the pulling, it is not the horse but the driver who drives the
   carriage.

   Reserving this last point until we consider sanctification, we now
   consider the calling, for this sheds more light upon the confession of
   the Reformed churches concerning the second grace than any other part
   of the work of grace.

   After the elect sinner is born again, i.e., quickened, endowed with the
   faculty of faith, and united with Jesus, the next work of grace in him
   is calling, of which Scripture speaks with such emphasis and so often.
   "But as He which has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
   conversation" (1 Pet. i. 15); "Who hath called you out of darkness into
   His marvelous light" (1 Pet. ii. 9); "The God of all grace who hath
   called us unto His eternal glory" (1 Pet. v. 10); "Whereunto He called
   you by our Gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
   Christ" (2 Thes. ii. 14); "Who hath called you unto His Kingdom and
   Glory" (1 Thes. ii. 12); "I beseech you to walk worthy of the calling
   wherewith ye were called" (Eph. iv. 1); and not to mention more: "Give
   diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these
   things ye shall never fall." (2 Pet. i. 10)

   In the Sacred Scripture calling has, like regeneration, a wider sense
   and a more limited.

   In the former sense, it means to be called to the eternal glory; hence
   this includes all that precedes, i.e., calling to repentance, to faith,
   to sanctification, to the performance of duty, to glory, to the eternal
   kingdom, etc.

   Of this, however, we do not speak now. It is now our intention to
   consider the calling in its limited sense, which signifies exclusively
   the calling whereby we are called from darkness into light; i.e., the
   call unto repentance.

   This call unto repentance is by many placed upon the same level with
   the "drawing," of which, e.g., Jesus speaks: "No man can come unto Me
   except the Father draw him." (John. vi. 44) This we find also in some
   of St. Paul's words: "Who hath delivered [Dutch translation, drawn] us
   from the power of darkness" (Col. i. 13); "That He might deliver [draw]
   us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our
   Father." (Gal. i. 4) However, this seems to me less correct. He that
   must be drawn seems to be unwilling. He that is called must be able to
   come. The first implies that the sinner is still passive, and therefore
   refers to the operation of the first grace; the second addresses the
   sinner himself, and counts him able to come, and hence belongs to the
   second grace.

   This "calling" is a summons. It is not merely the calling of one to
   tell him something, but a call implying the command to come; or a
   beseeching call, as when St. Paul prays: "As tho God did beseech you,
   be ye reconciled to God" (2 Cor. v. 20); or as in the Proverbs: "My
   son, give Me thine heart." (Prov. xxiii. 26)

   God sends this call forth by the preachers of the Word: not by the
   independent preaching of irresponsible men, but by those whom He
   Himself sends forth; men especially endowed, hence whose calling is not
   their own, but His. They are the ministers of the Word, royal
   ambassadors, in the name of the King of Kings demanding our heart,
   life, and person; yet whose value and honor depend exclusively upon
   their divine mission and commission. As the value of an echo depends
   upon the correct returning of the word received, so does their value,
   honor, and significance depend solely upon the correctness wherewith
   they call, as an echo of the Word of God. He who calls correctly fills
   the highest conceivable office on earth; for he calls kings and
   emperors, standing above them. But he who calls incorrectly or not at
   all is like a sounding brass; as a minister of the Word he is worthless
   and without honor. True to the pure Word, he is all; without it, he is
   nothing. Such is the responsibility of the preacher.

   This should be noticed lest Arminianism creep into the holy office. The
   preacher must be but instrument of the Holy Spirit; even the sermon
   must be the product of the Holy Ghost. To suppose that a preacher can
   have the least authority, honor, or official significance outside of
   the Word, is to make the office Arminian; not the Holy Spirit, but the
   dominie, is the worker; he works with all his might, and the Holy
   Spirit may be the minister's assistant. To avoid such mistake, our
   Reformed churches have always purged themselves of the leaven of
   clericalism.

   And through this office the call goes forth from the pulpit, in the
   catechetical class, in the family, in writing, and by personal
   exhortation. However, not always to every sinner directly through the
   office. On a ship at sea God may use a godly commander to call sinners
   to repentance. In a hospital without spiritual supervision the Lord may
   use a pious man or woman, both to nurse the sick and call their souls
   to repentance. In a village where the quasi-minister neglects his duty,
   the Lord God may be pleased to draw souls to life by printed sermons
   and books, by a newspaper even, or by individual exhortation.

   And yet in all these the authority to call reposes in the divine
   embassy of the ministry of the Word. For the instruments of the call,
   whether they were persons or printed books, proceeded from the office.
   The persons were themselves called through the office, and they only
   transmitted the divine message; and the printed books offered on paper
   what otherwise is heard in the sanctuary.

   This calling of the Holy Spirit proceeds in and through the preaching
   of the Word, and calls upon the regenerated sinner to arise from death,
   and to let Christ give him light. It is not a calling of persons still
   unregenerate, simply because such have no hearing ear.

   It is true that the preaching of missionary or minister of the Word
   addresses itself also to others, but this is not at all in conflict
   with what we have just said. In the first place, because there is also
   an outward call to the unregenerate, in order to deprive them of an
   excuse, and to show that they have no hearing ears. And second, because
   the minister of the Word does not know whether a man is born again or
   not, wherefore he may make no difference.

   As a rule, every baptized person should be reckoned as belonging to the
   regenerated (but not always converted); wherefore the preacher must
   call every baptized person to repentance, as tho he were born again.
   But let no one commit the mistake of applying this rule, which applies
   only to the Church as a whole, to every person in the Church. This
   would be either the climax of thoughtlessness or a complete
   misunderstanding of the reality of the grace of God.

  XXVIII.

  The Coming of the Called.


   "That the purpose of God according
   to election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth."--Rom.
   ix. 11.

   The question is, whether the elect cooperate in the call.

   We say, Yes; for the call is no call, in the fullest sense of the word,
   unless the called one can hear and hears so distinctly that it
   impresses him, causes him to rise and to obey God. For this reason our
   fathers, for the sake of clearness, used to distinguish between the
   ordinary call and the effectual call.

   God's call does not go forth to the elect alone. The Lord Jesus said:
   "Many are called, few are chosen." (Matt. xxii. 14) And the issue shows
   that masses of men die unconverted, altho called by the outward,
   ordinary call.

   Nor should this outward call be slighted or esteemed unimportant; for
   by it the judgment of many shall be made the heavier in the day of
   judgment: "If the mighty works which have been done in you had been
   done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth
   and ashes. Therefore it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than
   for you" (Matt. xi. 21, 22); "And the servant which knew the Lord's
   will and did not according to His will shall be beaten with many
   stripes." (Luke xii. 47) Moreover, the effect of this outward call
   reaches sometimes much deeper than is generally supposed, and brings
   one sometimes to the very point of real conversion.

   The unregenerate are not so insensible to the truth as never to be
   touched by it. The decisive words of Heb. vi., concerning the
   apparently converted who have even tasted of the heavenly gift, prove
   the contrary. St. Peter speaks of sows which were washed and then
   returned to the wallowing in the mire. One can be persuaded to be
   almost a Christian. But for the selling of his goods the rich young
   ruler would have been won for Christ. Wherefore the effect of the
   ordinary call is by no means as weak and meager as is commonly
   believed. In the parable of the sower the fourth class of hearers alone
   belong to the elect, for they alone bear fruit. Still there is among
   two of the remaining classes a considerable amount of growth. One of
   them even produces high stalks and ears; only there is no fruit.

   And for this reason the men that company with the people of God should
   earnestly examine their own hearts, whether their following of the Word
   is the result of having the seed sown in "good ground." Oh, there is so
   much of illumination and of delight even; and yet only to be choked,
   because it does not contain the genuine germ of life.

   All these unregenerate persons lack saving grace. They hear only with
   the carnal understanding. They receive the Word, but only in the field
   of their unsanctified imagination. They let it work upon their natural
   conscience. It plays merely upon the waves of their natural emotions.
   Thus they may be moved to tears, and they ardently love whatever so
   affects them. Yea, they often perform many good works which are truly
   praiseworthy; they may even give their goods to the poor, and their
   bodies to be burned. Their salvation is therefore considered to be a
   matter of fact. But the holy apostle completely destroys their hope,
   saying: "Tho you speak with the tongues of men and of angels, that you
   understand all mystery, tho you give all your goods to feed the poor,
   and tho you give your body to be burned, and have not love, it
   profiteth you nothing."

   Hence to be God's child and not a sounding brass, deep, insight, into
   the divine mysteries, an excited imagination, a troubled conscience,
   and waves of feeling are not required, for all these may be experienced
   without any real covenant grace; but what is needed is true, deep love
   operating in the heart, illuminating and vitalizing all these things.

   Adam's sin consisted in this, that he banished all the love of God from
   his heart. Now it is impossible to be neutral or indifferent toward
   God. When Adam ceased to love God, he began to hate Him. And it is this
   hatred of God which now lies at the bottom of the heart of every child
   of Adam. Hence conversion means this, that a man get rid of that hatred
   and receive love in its place. He who says from the heart, "I love the
   Lord;" is all right. What more can he desire!

   But as long as there is no love for God, there is nothing. For mere
   willingness to do something for God, even to bear great sacrifices, and
   to be very pious and benevolent, except it spring from the right
   motive, is in its deepest ground nothing but a despising of God.
   However beautiful the veneering, all these apparently good works are
   inwardly cankered, sin-eaten, and decayed. Love alone imparts the real
   flavor to the sacrifice. Wherefore the holy apostle declares so sternly
   and sharply: "Tho you give your body to be burned, and have not love,
   it profiteth you nothing."

   To perform good works in order to be saved, or to oblige God, or to
   make one's own piety lofty and conspicuous, is a growth from the old
   root and at the most but a semblance of love. To cherish true love for
   God is to be constrained by love to yield one's ego with all that it is
   and has, and to let God be God again. And the ordinary, the general,
   the outward call never has such effect; it is incapable of producing
   it.

   Wherefore we leave the ordinary call and return to the call which is
   particular, wonderful, inward, and effectual; which addresses itself
   not to all, but exclusively to the elect.

   This call, which is spoken of as "heavenly" (Heb. iii. 1), as "holy" (2
   Tim. i. 9), as "being without repentance" (Rom. xi. 29), is "according
   to God's purpose" (Rom. viii. 28), is "from above in Christ Jesus our
   Lord" (Phil. iii. 14), and does not have its starting-point in the
   preaching. He that calls by it is God, not the minister. And this call
   goes forth by the means of two agencies, one coming to man from without
   and the other from within. Both these agencies are effectual, and the
   call has accomplished its purpose and the sinner has come to repentance
   as soon as their workings meet and unite in the center of his being.

   Hence we deny that the regenerate, hearing the preached Word, will come
   of himself. We do not thus understand their cooperation. If the inward
   call is sufficient, how is it that the regenerate can sometimes hear
   the preaching without arising, unrepentant, refusing to let Christ give
   him light? But we confess that the call of the regenerate is twofold:
   from without by the preached Word, and from within by the exhortation
   and conviction of the Holy Spirit.

   Hence the work of the Holy Spirit in the calling is twofold:

   The first work is, as He comes with the Word: the Word which is
   inspired, prepared, committed to writing, and preserved by Himself, who
   is God the Holy Ghost. And He brings that Word to the sinners by
   preachers whom He Himself has endowed with talents, animation, and
   spiritual insight. And so wonderfully does He conduct that preaching
   through the channel of the office and of the historical development of
   the confession, that at last it comes to him in the form and character
   required to affect and win him.

   We see in this a very mysterious leading of the Holy Spirit. Afterward
   a preacher will learn that, under his preaching in such a church and at
   such an hour, a regenerate person was converted. And yet he had not
   specially prepared himself for it. Frequently he did not even know that
   person; much less his spiritual condition. And yet, without knowing it,
   his thoughts were guided and his word was prepared in such a way by the
   Holy Ghost; perhaps he looked at the man in such a manner that his
   word, in connection with the Spirit's inward operation, became to him
   the real and concrete Word of God. We hear it often said: "That was
   directly preached at me." And so it was. It should be understood,
   however, that it was not the minister who preached at you, for he did
   not even think of you; but it was the Holy Spirit Himself. It was He
   who thought of you. It was He who had it all prepared for you. It was
   He Himself who wrought in you.

   The ministers of the Word should therefore be exceedingly careful not
   in the least to boast of the conversions that occur under their
   ministry. When after days of failure the fisherman draws his net full
   of fishes, is this cause for the net to boast itself? Did it not come
   up empty again and again; and then was it not nearly torn asunder by
   the multitude of fishes?

   To say that this proves the efficiency of the preacher is against the
   Scripture. There may be two ministers, the one well grounded in
   doctrine, the other but lightly furnished; and yet the former has no
   conversions in his church, while the latter is being richly blessed. In
   this the Lord God is and remains the Sovereign Lord. He passes by the
   heavily armed champions in Saul's army, and David, with scarcely any
   weapons at all, slays the giant Goliath. All that a preacher has to do
   is to consider how, in obedience to his Lord, he may minister the Word,
   leaving results with the Lord. And when the Lord God gives him
   conversions, and Satan whispers, "What an excellent preacher you are,
   that it was given you to convert so many men!" then he is to say, "Get
   thee behind, me, Satan," giving the glory to the Holy Spirit alone.

   However, it is not the Holy Spirit's only care in such a way and focus
   of life to cause the Word to come to a regenerate person, but He adds
   also a second work, viz., that by which the preached Word effectively
   enters the very center of his heart and life.

   By this second care He so illuminates his natural understanding and
   strengthens his natural ability and imagination that he receives the
   general tenor of the preached Word and thoroughly understands its
   contents.

   But this is not all, for even pretended believers may have this. The
   seed of the Word attains this growth also in those who have received
   the seed into a rocky ground and among thorns. Hence to this is added
   the illumination of his understanding, which wonderful gift enables him
   not only to apprehend the general sense of the preached Word, but also
   to perceive and realize that this Word comes to him directly from God;
   that it affects and condemns his very being, thus causing him to
   penetrate into its hidden essence and feel the sharp sting which
   effects conviction.

   Lastly, the Holy Spirit plies this conviction--which otherwise would
   quickly vanish--so long and so severely, that finally the sting, like
   the keen edge of a lancet, pierces the thick skin and lays open the
   festering sore. This is in the called a very wonderful operation. The
   general understanding puts the matter before him; the illumination
   reveals to him what it contains; and the conviction puts the sharp
   two-edged sword directly upon his heart. Then, however, he is inclined
   to shrink from that sword; not to let it pierce through, but to let it
   glance harmlessly from the soul. But then the Holy Spirit, in full
   activity, continues to press that sword of conviction, driving it so
   forcibly into the soul that at last it cuts through and takes effect.

   But this does not end the calling. For after the Holy Spirit has done
   all this, He begins to operate upon the will; not by forcibly bending
   it, as an iron rod in the strong hand of the blacksmith, but by making
   it, tho stiff and unyielding, pliant and tender from within. He could
   not do this in the unregenerate. But having laid in regeneration the
   foundation of all these subsequent operations in the soul, He proceeds
   to build upon it; or, to take another figure, He draws the sprouts from
   the germ planted in the ground. They do not start of themselves, but He
   draws them out of the germ. A grain of wheat deposited in a desk
   remains what it is; but warmed by the sun in the soil, the heat causes
   it to sprout. And so it is here. The vital germ can do nothing of
   itself; it remains what it is. But when the Holy Spirit causes the
   fostering rays of the Sun of Righteousness to play upon it, then it
   germinates, and thus He draws from it the blade and the ear and the
   corn in the ear.

   Hence the yielding of the will is the result of a tenderness and
   emotion and affection which sprang from the implanted germ of life, by
   which the will, which was at first inflexible, became pliant; by which
   that which was inclined to the left was drawn to the right. And so, by
   this last act, conviction, with all that it contains, was brought into
   the will; and this resulted in the yielding of self, giving glory to
   God.

   And in this way love entered the soul--love tender, genuine, and
   mysterious, the ecstasy of which vibrates in our hearts during all our
   after-life.

   And this finishes the exposition of the divine work of calling. It
   belongs to the elect alone. It is irresistible, and no man can hinder
   it. Without it no sinner ever passed from the bitterness of hatred to
   the sweetness of love. When the call and regeneration coincide, they
   seem to be one; and so they are to our consciousness; but actually they
   are distinct. They differ in this respect, that regeneration takes
   place independently of the will and understanding; that it is wrought
   in us without our aid or cooperation; while in calling, the will and
   understanding begin to act, so that we hear with both the outward and
   inward ear, and with the inclined will are willing to go out to the
   light.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXIX.

  Conversion of All That Come.

   "Turn Thou me and I shall be turned." --Jer. xxxi. 18.

   The elect, born again and effectually called, converts himself. To
   remain unconverted is impossible; but he inclines his ear, he turns his
   face to the blessed God, he is converted in the fullest sense of the
   word.

   In conversion the fact of cooperation on the part of the saved sinner
   assumes a clearly defined and perceptible character. In regeneration
   there was none; in the calling there was a beginning of it; in
   conversion proper it became a fact. When the Holy Spirit regenerates a
   man, it is an "Effatha," i.e., He opens the ear. When He effectually
   calls him, He speaks into that opened ear, which cooperates by
   receiving the sound, that is, by harkening. But when the Holy Spirit
   actually converts the man, then the act of man coalesces with the act
   of the Holy Spirit, and it is said: "Let the wicked forsake his way,
   and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him"
   (Isa. lv. 7); and in another place: "The law of the Lord is perfect,
   converting the soul." (Psalm xix. 7)

   It is a remarkable fact that the Sacred Scripture refers to conversion
   almost one hundred and forty times as being an act of man, and only six
   times as an act of the Holy Ghost. It is repeated again and again:
   "Repent and turn to the Lord your God" (Acts xxvi. 20); "Turn, O
   backsliding children, saith the Lord" (Jer. iii. 22); "Sinners shall
   return unto Thee" (Psalm li. 13, Dutch Version); "Repent and do thy
   first works" (Rev. ii. 5). But conversion as an act of the Holy Spirit
   is spoken of only in Psalm xix. 8, "The law of the Lord is perfect,
   converting the soul"; in Jer. xxxi. 18, "Turn Thou me and I shall be
   turned"; in Acts xi. 18, "That God also to the Gentiles granted
   repentance unto life"; Rom. ii. 4, "That the goodness of God leadeth
   thee to repentance"; in 2 Tim. ii. 25, "If God peradventure will give
   them repentance"; in Heb. vi. 6, "That it is impossible to renew such
   (as fall away) to repentance."

   This fact should be carefully considered. When Scripture presents
   conversion as the Spirit's act but six times, and as man's act one
   hundred and forty times, in preaching the same proportion should be
   observed. And, therefore, the preachers who, when preaching on
   conversion, treat it almost invariably in its passive aspect and in the
   abstract; who apparently lack the courage and boldness to declare to
   their hearers that it is their duty to convert themselves unto God,
   seriously err. It has a very pious look, but it is against the
   Scripture. And yet it is perfectly natural that one should hesitate to
   say, "You must convert yourself," so long as regeneration and
   conversion are still confounded. For then the declaration, "You must
   convert yourself," ignores the sovereignty of God, and implies that a
   dead sinner is still able to do something of himself. And this is the
   reason why the preachers who will not surrender the sovereignty of God,
   and who will not deduct anything from the deadness of the sinner, are
   afraid "to speak to deaf ears." Hence they pray for the conversion of
   the hearers, but dare not in the Name of the Lord demand it of them.

   And nothing may be deducted either from the divine sovereignty or from
   the sinner's deadness. Every demand for conversion which has such
   tendency is Pelagianism, and must be rejected. But if the teaching of
   the Reformed Church in this respect be thoroughly understood, the whole
   difficulty disappears.

   It should be noticed, however, that Scripture, speaking of conversion,
   does not always imply that it is saving conversion. The real work of
   salvation is always accompanied on its way by a phantom. Alongside of
   saving faith goes temporal faith; alongside of the effectual call, the
   ordinary call;and alongside of saving conversion, ordinary conversion.

   Conversion in its saving sense occurs but once in a man's life, and
   this act can never be repeated. Once having passed from death unto
   life, he is alive and will never return unto death. Perdition is not a
   stream spanned by many bridges; nor does the saint, tossed between
   endless hopes and fears, cross the bridge leading to life, by and by to
   return by another to the shores of death. No; there is but one bridge,
   which can be crossed but once; and he that has crossed it is kept by
   the power of God from going back. Tho all powers should combine to draw
   him back, God is stronger than all, and no one shall pluck him out of
   His hand.

   We state this as distinctly and forcibly as possible, for at this point
   souls are often led astray. It is heard repeatedly these days, "Your
   conversion is not a momentary act, but an act of life which repeats
   itself constantly; and wo to the man who fails for a single day to be
   converted anew." And this is altogether wrong. Language should not be
   so confounded. Tho the child grows for twenty years after he is born,
   and before he attains maturity, yet, he is born but once, and neither
   conception nor pregnancy before it, nor growth after it, is called
   "birth."

   The fixed boundary should be respected also in this instance. It is
   true that conversion is preceded by something else, but that is called
   not "conversion," but "regeneration" and "calling"; and so there is
   something following "conversion," but that is called "sanctification."
   No doubt the word "conversion" may also be applied to the return of the
   converted but backslidden child of God, after the example of Scripture;
   but then it refers not to the saving act of conversion, but to the
   continuance of the work once begun, or to a return not from death, but
   from a temporary going astray.

   In order to discriminate correctly in this matter, it is necessary to
   notice the fourfold use of the word conversion in the Scripture.

   1. "Conversion," in its widest scope, signifies a forsaking of
   wickedness and a disposition to morality. In this sense it is said of
   the Ninevites that God saw their works, that they turned from their
   evil works. This does not imply, however, that all these Ninevites
   belonged to the elect, and that every one of them was saved.

   2. "Conversion," in its limited sense, signifies saving conversion, as
   in Isa. lv. 7: "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
   his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy
   upon him, and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon."

   3. And again, "conversion" signifies that, even after it has become a
   fact in our hearts, its principles must be applied to every relation of
   our life. A converted person may for a long time continue to indulge in
   bad habits and ungodly practises, but gradually his eyes are opened for
   the evil, and then he repents and forsakes the one after the other. So
   we read in Ezek. xviii. 30: "Repent and turn yourselves from all your
   transgressions."

   4. Lastly, "conversion" signifies the return of converted persons to
   their first love, after a season of coldness and weakness in the faith,
   e.g.: "Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent and
   do thy first works" (Rev. ii. 5).

   But in this connection we speak of saving conversion, of which we make
   the following remarks:

   First--It is not the spontaneous act of the regenerate. Without the
   Holy Spirit conversion would not follow regeneration. Even tho called,
   he could not come of himself. Hence it is of primary importance to
   acknowledge the Holy Spirit, and to honor His work as the first cause
   of conversion as well as of regeneration and calling. As no one can
   pray as he ought unless the Holy Spirit prays in him with groans that
   can not be uttered, so no regenerate and called person can convert
   himself as he ought unless the Holy Spirit begin and continue the work
   in him. The redemptive work is not like the growing plant, increasing
   of itself. Nay, if the saint is a temple of God, the Holy Spirit dwells
   in him. And this indwelling indicates that everything accomplished by
   the saint is wrought in him in communion with, by the incitement and
   through the animation of the Holy Spirit. The implanted life is not an
   isolated germ left to root in the soul without the Holy Spirit and the
   Mediator, but it is carried, kept, bedewed, and fostered from moment to
   moment out of Christ by the Holy Spirit. As men can not speak without
   air and the operation of Providence vitalizing the organs of
   respiration and articulation, so it is impossible that the regenerated
   man can live and speak and act from the new life without being
   supported, incited, and animated by the Holy Spirit.

   Hence when the Holy Spirit calls that man and he turns himself, then
   there is not the slightest part in this act of the will which is not
   supported, incited, and animated by the Holy Spirit.

   Second--This saving conversion is also the conscious and voluntary
   choice and act of the person born again and called. While the air and
   impulse to speak must come from without, and my organs of speech must
   be supported by the providence of God, yet it is I who speak. And in
   much stronger sense does the Holy Spirit in conversion work upon the
   wheels and springs of man's regenerated personality, so that all His
   operations must pass through man's ego.

   Many of His operations do not affect the ego, as in Balaam's case. But
   not so in conversion. Then the Holy Spirit works only through us.
   Whatever He wills He brings into our will; He causes all His actions to
   be effected through the organism of our being.

   Hence man must be commanded, "Convert thyself." The teacher bids the
   pupil speak, altho he knows that the child can not do so unaided by
   Providence. In the new life the ego depends upon the Holy Spirit who
   dwells and works in him. But in conversion he knows nothing of this
   indwelling, nor that he is born again; and it would be useless to speak
   to him about it. He must be told, "Convert thyself." If the Spirit's
   action accompanies that word, the man will convert himself; if not, he
   will continue unconverted. But tho he convert himself, he will not
   boast, I have done this myself, but bow down in thankfulness and
   glorify that divine work by which he was converted.

   In these two we find the evidence of genuine conversion: first, the man
   bidden, converts himself, and then he gratefully gives glory to the
   Holy Spirit alone. Not that we fear a man's conversion will be hindered
   by some one's neglect. In all the work of God's grace His Almightiness
   sweeps away everything that resists, so that all opposition melts away
   like wax, and every mountain of pride flees from His presence. Neither
   slothfulness nor neglect can ever hinder an elect person from passing
   from death into life at the appointed time.

   But there is a responsibility for the preacher, for the pastor, for
   parents and guardians. To be free from a man's blood, we must tell
   every man that conversion is his urgent duty; and to be without excuse
   before God, after his conversion, we must give thanks to God, who alone
   has accomplished it in and through His creature.

JUSTIFICATION.

  XXX.

  Justification.

   "Being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in
   Christ Jesus."--Rom. iii. 24.

   The Heidelberg Catechism teaches that true conversion consists of these
   two parts: the dying of the old man, and the rising again of the new.
   This last should be noticed. The Catechism says not that the new life
   originates in conversion, but that it arises in conversion. That which
   arises must exist before. Else how could it arise? This agrees with our
   statement that regeneration precedes conversion, and that by the
   effectual calling the newborn child of God is brought to conversion.

   We now proceed to consider a matter which, tho belonging to the same
   subject and running parallel with it, yet moves, along an entirely
   different line, viz., Justification.

   In the Sacred Scripture, justification occupies the most conspicuous
   place, and is presented as of greatest importance for the sinner: "For
   all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified
   freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"
   (Rom. iii. 24). "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace
   with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. v. 1); "Who was delivered
   for our offenses and raised again for our justification" (Rom. iv. 25);
   "Who of God is made unto us from God, wisdom and righteousness and
   sanctification and redemption" (1 Cor. i. 30).

   And not only is this so strongly emphasized by Scripture, but it was
   also the very kernel of the Reformation, which puts this doctrine of
   "justification by faith" boldly and clearly in opposition to the
   "meritorious works of Rome." "Justification by faith" was in those days
   the shibboleth of the heroes of faith, Martin Luther in the van.

   And when, in the present century, a self-wrought sanctification
   presented itself again, as the actual power of redemption, it was the
   not insignificant merit of KÃ¶hlbrugge, that he, tho less
   comprehensively than the reformers, fastened this matter of
   justification, with penetrating earnestness, upon the conscience of
   Christendom. It may have been superfluous for the churches still truly
   Reformed, but it was exceedingly opportune for the circles where the
   garland of truth was less closely woven, and the sense of justice had
   been allowed to become weak, as partially in our own country, but
   especially beyond our borders. There are in Switzerland and in Bohemia
   groups of men who have heard, for the first time, of the necessity of
   justification by faith, through the labors of KÃ¶hlbrugge.

   Through the grace of God, our people did not go so far astray; and
   where the Ethicals, largely from principle, surrendered this point of
   doctrine, the Reformed did and do oppose them, admonishing them with
   all energy, and as often as possible, not to merge justification in
   sanctification.

   Regarding the question, how justification differs, on the one hand,
   from "regeneration," and, on the other, from "calling and conversion,"
   we answer that justification emphasizes the idea of right.

   Right regulates the relations between two persons. Where there is but
   one there is no right, simply because there are no relations to
   regulate. Hence by right we understand either the right of man in
   relation to man, or the claim of God upon man. It is in this last sense
   that we use the word right.

   The Lord is our Lawgiver, our judge, our King. Hence He is absolutely
   Sovereign: as Lawgiver determining what is right; as Judge judging our
   being and doing; as King dispensing rewards and punishments. This sheds
   light upon the difference between justification and regeneration. The
   new birth and the call and conversion have to do with our being as
   sinners or as regenerate men; but justification with the relation which
   we sustain to God, either as sinners or as those born again.

   Apart from the question of right, the sinner may be considered as a
   sick person, who is infected and inoculated with disease. After being
   born again he improves, the infection disappears, the corruption
   ceases, and he prospers again. But this concerns his person alone, how
   he is, and what his prospects are; it does not touch the question of
   right.

   The question of right arises when I see in the sinner a creature not
   his own, but belonging to another.

   Herein is all the difference. If man is to me the principal factor, so
   that I have nothing else in view but his improvement and deliverance
   from misery, then the Almighty God is in this whole matter a mere
   Physician, called in and affording assistance, who receives His fee,
   and is discharged with many thanks. The question of right does not
   enter here at all. So long as the sinner is made more holy, all is
   well. Of course, if he is made perfect, all the better. Clearly
   understanding, however, that man belongs not to himself, but to
   another, the matter assumes an entirely different aspect. For then he
   can not be or do as he pleases, but another has determined what he must
   be and what he must do. And if he does or is otherwise, he is guilty as
   a transgressor: guilty because he rebelled, guilty because he
   transgressed.

   Hence when I believe in the divine sovereignty, the sinner appears to
   me in an entirely different aspect. As infected and mortally ill, he is
   to be pitied and kindly treated; but considered as belonging to God,
   standing under God, and as having robbed God, that same sinner becomes
   a guilty transgressor.

   This is true to some extent of animals. When I lasso a wild horse on
   the American prairies for training, it never enters my mind to punish
   him for his wildness. But the runaway in the city streets must be
   punished. He is vicious; he threw his rider; he refused to be led and
   chose his own way. Hence he needs to be punished.

   And man much more so. When I meet him in his wild career of sin, I know
   that he is a rebel, that he broke the reins, threw his rider, and now
   dashes on in mad revolt. Hence such sinner must be not only healed, but
   punished. He does not need medical treatment alone, but before all
   things he needs juridical treatment.

   Apart from his disease a sinner has done evil; there is no virtue in
   him; he has violated the right; he deserves punishment. Suppose, for a
   moment, that sin had not touched his person, had not corrupted him, had
   left him intact as a man, then there would have been no need of
   regeneration, of healing, of a rising again, of sanctification;
   nevertheless he would have been subject to the vengeance of justice.

   Hence man's case in relation to his God must be considered juridically.
   Be not afraid of that word, brother. Rather insist that it be
   pronounced with as strong an emphasis as possible. It must be
   emphasized, and all the more strongly, because for so many years it has
   been scorned; and the churches have been made to believe that this
   "juridical" aspect of the case was of no importance; that it was a
   representation really unworthy of God; that the principal thing was to
   bring forth fruit meet for repentance.

   Beautiful teaching, gradually pushed into the world from the closet of
   philosophy: teaching that declares that morality included the right and
   stood far above the right; that "right" was chiefly a notion of the
   life of less civilized ages and of crude persons, but of no importance
   to our ideal age and to the ideal development of humanity and of
   individuals; yea, that in some respects it is even objectionable, and
   should never be allowed to enter into that holy and high and tender
   relation that exists between God and man.

   The fruit of this pestilential philosophy is, that now in Europe the
   sense of right is gradually dying of slow consumption. Among the
   Asiatic nations this sense of right has greater vitality than among us.
   Might is again greater than right. Right is again the right of the
   strongest. And the luxurious circles, who in their atony (Ed. Note:
   Def. "lack of bodily tone or muscle tone") of spirit at first protested
   against the "juridical" in theology, discover now with terror that
   certain classes in society are losing more and more respect for the
   "juridical" in the question of property. Even in regard to the
   possession of land and house, and treasure and fields, this new
   conception of life considers the "juridical" a less noble idea. Bitter
   satire! You who, in your wantonness, started the mockery of the
   "juridical" in connection with God, find your punishment now in the
   fact that the lower classes start the mockery of this "juridical" in
   connection with your money and your goods. Yea, more than this. When
   recently in Paris a woman was tried for having shot and killed a man in
   court, not only did the jury acquit her, but she was made the heroine
   of an ovation. Here also other motives were deemed more precious, and
   the "juridical" aspect had nothing to do with it.

   And, therefore, in the name of God and of the right which He has
   ordained, we urgently request that every minister of the Word, and
   every man in his place, help and labor, with clear consciousness and
   energy, to stop this dissolution of the right, with all the means at
   their disposal; and especially solemnly and effectually to restore to
   its own conspicuous place the juridical feature of the sinner's
   relation to his God. When this is done, we shall feel again the
   stimulus that will cause the soul's relaxed muscles to contract,
   rousing us from our semi-unconsciousness. Every man, and especially
   every member of the Church, must again realize his juridical relation
   to God now and forever; that he is not merely man or woman, but a
   creature belonging to God, absolutely controlled by God; and guilty and
   punishable when not acting according to the will of God.

   This being clearly understood, it is evident that regeneration and
   calling, and conversion, yea, even complete reformation and
   sanctification, can not be sufficient; for, altho these are very
   glorious, and deliver you from sin's stain and pollution, and help you
   not to violate the law so frequently, yet they do not touch your
   juridical relation to God.

   When a mutinous battalion gets into serious straits, and the general,
   hearing of it, delivers them at the cost of ten killed and twenty
   wounded, who had not mutinied, and brings them back and feeds them, do
   you think that that will be all? Do you not see that such battalion is
   still liable to punishment with decimation? And when man mutinied
   against his God, and got himself into trouble and nearly perished with
   misery, and the Lord God sent him help to save him, and called him
   back, and he returned, can that be the end of it? Do you not clearly
   see that he is still liable to severe punishment? In case of a burglar
   who robs and kills, but in making his escape breaks his leg, and is
   sent to the hospital where he is treated, and then goes out a cripple
   unable to repeat his crime, do you think that the judge would give him
   his liberty, saying: "He is healed now and will never do it again"? No;
   he will be tried, convicted, and incarcerated. Even so here. Because by
   our sins and transgressions we have wounded ourselves, and made
   ourselves wretched, and are in need of medical help, is our guilt
   forgotten for this reason?

   Why, then, are such undermining ideas brought among the people? Why is
   it that under the appearance of love a sentimental Christianity is
   introduced about the "dear Jesus," and "that we are so sick," and "the
   Physician is passing by," and that "It is, oh! so glorious to be in
   fellowship with that holy Mediator"?

   Are our people really ignorant of the fact that this whole
   representation stands diametrically opposed to Sacred
   Scripture--opposed to all that ever animated the Church of Christ and
   made it strong? Do they not feel that such a feeble and spongy
   Christianity is a clay too soft for the making of heroes in the Kingdom
   of God? And do they not see that the number of men who are drawn to the
   "dear Jesus" is much smaller now than that of the men who formerly were
   drawn to the Mediator of the right, who with His precious blood hath
   fully satisfied for all our sins?

   And when it is answered, "That is just what we teach; reconciliation in
   His blood, redemption through His death! It is all paid for us! Only
   come and hear our preaching, and sing our hymns!" then we beseech the
   brethren who thus speak to be serious for a moment. For, behold, our
   objection is not that you deny the reconciliation through His blood,
   but that, by being silent on the question of God's right, and of our
   state of condemnation, and by being satisfied when the people "only
   come to Jesus," you allow the consciousness of guilt to wear out, you
   make genuine repentance impossible, you substitute a certain discontent
   with oneself for brokenness of heart; and thus you weaken the faculty
   to feel, to understand, and to realize what the meaning is of
   reconciliation through the blood of the cross.

   It is quite possible to bring about reconciliation without touching the
   question of the right at all. By some misunderstanding two friends have
   become estranged, separated from, and hostile to each other. But they
   may be reconciled. Not necessarily by making one to see that he
   violated the rights of the other; this was perhaps never intended. And
   even if there was some right violated, it would not be expedient to
   speak of the past, but to cover it with the mantle of love and to look
   only to the future. And such reconciliation, if successful, is very
   delightful, and may have cost both the reconciled and the reconciler
   much of conflict and sacrifice, yea, prayers and tears. And yet, with
   all this, such reconciliation does not touch the question of right.

   In this way it appears to us these brethren preach reconciliation. It
   is true that they preach it with much warmth and animation even;
   but--and this is our complaint--they consider and present it as an
   enmity caused by whispering, misunderstanding, and wrong inclination,
   rather than by violation of the right. And, in consequence, their
   preaching of reconciliation through the blood of the cross no longer
   causes the deep chord of the right to vibrate in men's souls; but it
   resembles the reconciliation of two friends, who at an evil hour became
   estranged from each other.

  XXXI.

  Our Status.

   "And he believed in the Lord: and he counted it to him for
   righteousness." --Gen. xv. 6.

   The right touches a man's status. So long as the law has not proven him
   guilty, has not convicted and sentenced him, his legal status is that
   of a free and law-abiding citizen. But as soon as his guilt is proven
   in court and the jury has convicted him, he passes from that into the
   status of the bound and law-breaking citizen.

   The same applies to our relation to God. Our status before God is that
   either of the just or of the unjust. In the former, we are not
   condemned or we are released from condemnation. He that is still under
   condemnation occupies the status of the unjust.

   Hence, and this is noteworthy, a man's status depends not upon what he
   is, but upon the decision of the proper authorities regarding him; not
   upon what he is actually, but upon what he is counted to be.

   A clerk in an office is innocently suspected of embezzlement, and
   accused before a court of law. He pleads not guilty; but the suspicions
   against him carry conviction, and the judge condemns him. Now, tho he
   did not embezzle, is actually innocent, he is counted guilty. And since
   a man does not determine his own status, but his sovereign or judge
   determines it for him, the status of this clerk, altho innocent, is,
   from the moment of his conviction, that of a law-breaker. And the
   contrary may occur just as well. In the absence of convicting evidence
   the judge may acquit a dishonest clerk, who, altho guilty and a
   law-breaker, still retains his status of a law-abiding and honest
   citizen. In this case he is dishonorable, but he is counted honorable.
   Hence a man's status depends not upon what he actually is, but what he
   is counted to be.

   The reason is, that man's status has no reference to his inward being,
   but only to the manner in which he is to be treated. It would be
   useless to determine this himself, for his fellow citizens would not
   receive it. Tho he asserted a hundred times, "I am an honorable
   citizen," they would pay no attention to it. But if the judge declares
   him, honorable; and then they should dare to call him dishonorable,
   there would be a power to maintain his status against those who attack
   him. Hence a man's own declaration can not obtain him a legal status.
   He may fancy or assume a status of righteousness, but it has no
   stability, it is no status.

   This explains why, in our own good land, a man's legal status as a
   citizen is determined not by himself, but solely by the king, either,
   as sovereign or as judge. The king is judge, for all judgment is
   pronounced in his name; and, altho the judiciary can not be denied a
   certain authority independent of the executive, yet in every sentence
   it is the king's judicature which pronounces judgment. Hence a man's
   status depends solely upon the king's decision. Now the king has
   decided, once for all, that every citizen never convicted of crime is
   counted honorable. Not because all are honorable, but that they shall
   be counted as such. Hence so long as a man was never sentenced, he
   passes for honorable, even tho he is not. And as soon as he is
   sentenced, he is considered dishonorable, tho he is perfectly
   honorable. And thus his status is determined by his king; and in it he
   is accounted not according to what he is, but what his king counts him
   to be. Even without the judiciary, it is the king who determines a
   man's state in society, not according to what he is, but what the king
   counts him to be.

   A person's sex is determined not by his condition, but by what the
   registrar of vital statistics in his register has declared him to be.
   If by some mistake a girl were registered as a boy, and therefore
   counted as a boy, then at the proper time she would be summoned to
   serve in the militia, unless the mistake were corrected, and she be
   counted to be what she is. It may be a pretended, and not the real,
   child of the rich nobleman in whose name it is registered. And yet it
   makes no difference whose child it really is, for the state will
   support it in all its rights of inheritance, because it passes for the
   child of that nobleman, and is counted to be his legitimate child.

   Hence it is the rule in society that a man's status is determined not
   by his actual condition, nor by his own declaration, but by the
   sovereign under whom he stands. And this sovereign has the power, by
   his decision, to assign to a man the status to which, according to his
   condition, he belongs, or to put him in a status where he does not
   belong, but to which he is accounted to belong.

   This is the case even in matters where mistakes are out of the
   question. At the time of the king's death and of the pregnancy of his
   widow, a prince or princess is counted to exist, even before he or she
   is born. And, accordingly, while the child is still a nursing babe, it
   is counted to be the owner of large possessions, even tho these
   possessions may be entirely lost, before the child can hear of them.
   And so there are a number of cases where standing and condition,
   without anybody's fault or mistake, are entirely different; simply
   because it is possible that a man be in a state into which he has not
   yet grown.

   The king alone can determine his own status; if it pleases him to
   register to-morrow incognito, as a count or a baron, he will be
   relieved from the usual royal honors.

   We have elaborated this point more largely, because the Ethicals and
   the Mystics have got our poor people so bitterly out of the habit of
   reckoning with this counting of God. The word of Scripture, "Abraham
   believed, and it was counted to him for righteousness," (Gen. xv. 6 and
   Rom. iv. 3) is no longer understood; or it is made to refer to the
   merit of faith, which is Arminian doctrine.

   The Holy Spirit often speaks of this counting of God: "I am counted
   with them that go down into the pit" (Psalm lxxxviii. 4); "The Lord
   shall count them when He writeth up the peoples" (Psalm lxxxvii. 6);
   "And it was counted unto Phineas for righteousness unto all
   generations, forevermore." (Psalm cvi. 31) So it is said of Jesus, that
   "He was counted [numbered] with the transgressors" (Mark xv. 28); of
   Judas that "he was counted with the eleven"; of the uncircumcision
   which keeps the law, that "It shall be counted unto him for
   circumcision"; of Abraham that "his faith was counted unto him for
   righteousness" (Rom. iv. 3); of him "that worketh not, but believeth on
   Him that justifieth the ungodly," that "his faith is counted unto him
   for righteousness" (Rom. iv. 5); and of the children of the promise
   that "they are counted for the seed." (Rom. ix. 8)

   It is this very counting that appears to the children of this present
   age so incomprehensible and problematic. They will not hear of it. And,
   as Rome at one time severed the tendon of the Gospel, by merging
   justification in sanctification, mixing and identifying the two, so do
   people now refuse to listen to anything but an Ethical justification,
   which is actually only a species of sanctification. Hence God's
   counting counts for nothing. It is not heeded. It has no worth nor
   significance attached to it. The only question is what a man is. The
   measure of worth is nothing else but the worth of our personality.

   And this we oppose most emphatically. It is a denial of justification
   in toto; and such denial is essentially mutiny and rebellion against
   God, a withdrawing of oneself from the authority of one's legal
   sovereign.

   All those who consider themselves saved because they have holy
   emotions, or because they think themselves less sinful, and profess to
   make progress in sanctification--all these, however dissimilar they may
   be in all other things, have this in common, that they insist on being
   counted according to their own declaration, and not according to what
   God counts them to be. Instead of leaving, as dependent creatures, the
   honor of determining their status to their sovereign King, whose they
   are, they sit as judges to determine it themselves, by their own
   progress in good works.

   And not only this, but they also detract from the redemption which is
   in Christ Jesus, and from the reality of the guilt for which He
   satisfied. He who maintains that God must count a man according to what
   he is, and not according to what God wills to count him, can never
   understand how the Lord Jesus could bear our sins, and be a "curse" and
   "sin" for us. He must interpret this sin-bearing in the sense of a
   physical or Ethical fellowship, and seek for reconciliation not in the
   cross of Jesus, but in His manger, as many actually do in these days.

   And as they thus make the actual bearing of our guilt by the Mediator
   unthinkable, so they make inherited guilt impossible.

   Assuredly, they say, there is inherited stain, taken in a Manichean
   sense, but no original guilt. For how could the guilt of a dead man be
   counted unto us? It is evident, therefore, that by this thoughtless and
   bold denial of the right of God, not only is justification disjointed,
   but the whole structure of salvation is robbed of its foundation.

   And why is this? Is it because the human consciousness can not conceive
   the idea of being counted according to what we are not? Our
   illustrations from the social life show that men readily understand and
   daily accept such a relation in common affairs. The deep cause of this
   unbelief lies in the fact that man will not rest in God's judgment
   concerning him, but that he seeks for rest in his own estimate of
   himself; that this estimate is considered a safer shield than God's
   judgment concerning him; and that, instead of living with the reformers
   by faith, he tries to live by the things found in himself.

   And from this men must return. This leads us back to Rome; this is to
   forsake justification by faith; this is to sever the artery of grace.
   Much more than in the political realm must the sacred principle be
   applied to the Kingdom of heaven, that to our Sovereign King and judge
   alone belongs the prerogative, by His decision, absolutely to determine
   our state of righteousness or of unrighteousness.

   The sovereignty which reposes in an earthly king is only borrowed,
   derived, and laid upon him; but the sovereignty of the Lord our God is
   the source and fountainhead of all authority and of all binding force.

   If it belongs to the very essence of sovereignty, that by the ruler's
   decision alone the status of his subjects is determined, then it must
   be clear, and it can not be otherwise than that this very authority
   belongs originally, absolutely, and supremely to our God. Whom He
   judges guilty is guilty, and must be treated as guilty; and whom He
   declares just is just, and must be treated as just. Before He entered
   Gethsemane, Jesus our King declared to His disciples: "Now are ye clean
   through the word which I have spoken unto you." (John xv. 3) And this
   is His declaration even now, and it shall forever remain so. Our state,
   our place, our lot for eternity depends not upon what we are, nor upon
   what others see in us, nor upon what we imagine or presume ourselves to
   be, but only upon what God thinks of us, what He counts us to be, what
   He, the Almighty and just judge, declares us to be.

   When He declares us just, when He thinks us just, when He counts us
   just, then we are by this very thing His children who shall not lie,
   and ours is the inheritance of the just, altho we lie in the midst of
   sin. And in like manner, when He pronounces us guilty in Adam, when in
   Adam He counts us subject to condemnation, then we are guilty, fallen,
   and condemned, even tho we discover in our hearts nothing but sweet and
   childlike innocence.

   In this way alone it must be understood and interpreted that the Lord
   Jesus was numbered with the transgressors, altho He was holy; that He
   was made sin, altho He was the living Righteousness; and that He was
   declared a curse in our place, altho He was Immanuel. In the days of
   His flesh He was numbered with transgressors and sinners, He was put in
   their state, and He was treated accordingly; as such the burden of
   God's wrath came upon Him, and as such His Father forsook Him, and gave
   Him over to bitterest death. In the Resurrection alone He was restored
   to the status of the righteous, and thus He was raised for our
   justification.

   Oh, this matter goes so deep! When to the Lord God is again ascribed
   His sovereign prerogative to determine a man's status, then every
   mystery of Scripture assumes its rightful place; but when it is not,
   then the entire way of salvation must be falsified.

   Finally, if one should say: "An earthly sovereign may be mistaken, but
   God can not be; hence God must assign to every man a status which
   accords with his work"; then we answer: "This would be so, if the
   omnipotent grace of God were not irresistible." But since it is, you
   are not esteemed by God according to what you are, but you are what God
   esteems you to be.

  XXXII.

  Justification from Eternity

   "The righteousness which is of God by faith." --Phil. iii. 9.

   It has become evident that the question which most closely concerns us
   is, not whether we are more or less holy, but whether our status is
   that of the just or of the unjust; and that this is determined not by
   what we are at any given moment, but by God as our Sovereign and Judge.

   In Adam's creation God put us, without any preceding merits on our
   part, in the state of original righteousness. After the fall, according
   to the same sovereign prerogative, He put us, as Adam's descendants, in
   the state of unrighteousness, imputing Adam's guilt to each personally.
   And in exactly the same manner He now justifies the ungodly, i.e., He
   places him, without any previous merit on his part, in the state of
   righteousness according to His own holy and inviolable prerogative.

   In the creation He did not first wait to see whether man would develop
   holiness in himself, so as to declare him righteous on the ground of
   this holiness; but He declared him originally righteous, even before
   there was a possibility on his part of evincing a desire for holiness.
   And after the fall He did not wait to see whether sin would manifest
   itself in us, so as to assign us to the state of the unrighteous on the
   ground of this sin; but before our birth, before there was a
   possibility of personal sin, He declared us guilty. And in the same
   manner God does not wait to see whether a sinner shows signs of
   conversion in order to restore him to honor as a righteous person, but
   He declares the ungodly just before he has had the least possibility of
   doing any good work.

   Hence there is a sharp line between our sanctification and our
   justification. The former has to do with the quality of our being,
   depends upon our faith, and can not be effected outside of us. But

   justification is effected outside of us, irrespective of what we are,
   dependent only upon the decision of God, our judge and Sovereign; in
   such a way that justification precedes sanctification, the latter
   proceeding from the former as a necessary result. God does not justify
   us because we are becoming more holy, but when He has justified us we
   grow in holiness: "Being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved
   from wrath through Him." (Rom. v. 9)

   There should never be the least doubt regarding this matter. Every
   effort to reverse this established order of Scripture must earnestly be
   resisted. This glorious confession, declared with so much power to the
   souls of men in the days of the Reformation, must continue the precious
   jewel, to be transmitted intact by us to our posterity as a sacred
   inheritance. So long as we ourselves have not yet entered the New
   Jerusalem, our comfort should never be founded upon our sanctification,
   but exclusively upon our justification. Tho our sanctification were
   ever so far advanced, so long as we are not justified we remain in our
   sin and are lost. And if a justified sinner die immediately after his
   justification is sealed to his soul, he may shout with joy, for, in
   spite of hell and of Satan, he is sure of his salvation.

   The deep significance of this confession is faintly discernible in our
   earthly relations. In order to do business on the floor of the
   exchange, a trader must be an honorable citizen. If convicted of crime,
   justly or unjustly, he will be expelled from exchange, tho he be ten
   times more honest than others whose fraudulent transactions have never
   been discovered. And how will this dishonored man be restored to his
   former position? On the ground of future honest business transactions?
   That is out of the question; for as long as he is counted dishonorable,
   he is not allowed to do business on the floor. Hence he can not prove
   his honesty by any dealings on exchange or in the market. So in order
   to start again, he must first be declared an honorable man. Then, and
   not before, can he set up in business once more.

   Call this doing of business sanctification, and this declaration of
   being a man of honor justification, and the matter will be illustrated.
   For as this merchant, being declared dishonorable, can not do business
   so long as he continues in that state, and must be declared honorable
   before he can begin anew, so a sinner can not do any good work so long
   as he is counted lost. And so he must first be declared just by his
   God, in order to transact the honorable business of sanctification.

   To prove that this is effected absolutely without our own merit, doing
   or not doing, and entirely without our actual condition, we refer to
   the royal prerogative for granting pardon and reinstatement. Altho,
   among us, decisions of the judiciary are rendered in the name of the
   king, and yet not by the king himself, a certain opposition between the
   king and the judiciary is thinkable. It might occur that the judiciary
   declared a man guilty and dishonorable, whom the king wished not to be
   so declared. To keep the majesty of the crown inviolate in such cases,
   the prerogative of granting pardon and reinstatement is retained by
   almost every crowned head; a prerogative which in the present day is
   narrowly circumscribed, but which nevertheless represents still the
   exalted idea that the decision of the king, and not our actual
   condition, determines our lot. Hence a king can either grant pardon,
   i.e., remit the penalty and release the guilty person from all the
   consequences of his crime, or, stronger still, he can grant
   reinstatement, i.e., he can restore the accused and condemned to the
   condition of one who had never been declared guilty.

   And this exalted royal prerogative, of which on account of sin there
   remains in earthly kings but a faint shadow, is the inviolable right in
   which God rejoices, Himself being the Source and all-comprehending Idea
   of all majesty. Not you, but He determines what His creature shall be;
   hence He sovereignly disposes, by the word of His mouth, the status
   wherein you will be set, whether it be of righteousness or of
   unrighteousness.

   It is also evident that the sinner's justification need not wait until
   he is converted, nor until he has become conscious, nor even until he
   is born. This could not be so if justification depended upon something
   within him. Then he could not be justified before he existed and had
   done something. But if justification is not bound to anything in him,
   then this whole limitation must disappear, and the Lord our God be
   sovereignly free to render this justification at any moment that He
   pleases. Hence the Sacred Scripture reveals justification as an eternal
   act of God, i.e., an act which is not limited by any moment in the
   human existence. It is for this reason that the child of God, seeking
   to penetrate into that glorious and delightful reality of his
   justification, does not feel himself limited to the moment of his
   conversion but feels that this blessedness flows to him from the
   eternal depths of the hidden life of God.

   It should therefore openly be confessed, and without any abbreviation,
   that justification does not occur when we become conscious of it, but
   that, on the contrary, our justification was decided from eternity in
   the holy judgment-seat of our God.

   There is undoubtedly a moment in our life when for the first time
   justification is published to our consciousness; but let us be careful
   to distinguish justification itself from its publication. Our Christian
   name was selected for and applied to us long before we, with clear
   consciousness, knew it as our name; and altho there was a moment in
   which it became a living reality to us and was called out for the first
   time in the ear of our consciousness, yet no man will be so foolish as
   to imagine that it was then that he actually received that name.

   And so it is here. There is a certain moment wherein that justification
   becomes to our consciousness a living fact; but in order to become a
   living fact, it must have existed before. It does not spring from our
   consciousness, but it is mirrored in it, and hence must have being and
   stature in itself. Even an elect infant which dies in the cradle is
   declared just, tho the knowledge or consciousness of its justification
   never penetrated its soul. And elect persons, converted, like the thief
   on the cross, with their last breath, can scarcely be sensible of their
   justification, and yet enter eternal life exclusively on the ground of
   their justification. Taking an analogy from daily life, a man condemned
   during his absence in foreign lands was granted pardon through the
   intercession of his friends, wholly without his knowledge. Does this
   pardon take effect when long afterward the good news reaches him, or
   when the king signs his pardon? Of course the latter. Even so does the
   justification of God's children take effect, not on the day when for
   the first time it is published to their consciousness, but at the
   moment that God in His holy judgment-seat declares them just.

   But--and this should not be overlooked--this publishing in the
   consciousness of the person himself must necessarily follow; and this
   brings us back again to the special work of the Holy Spirit. For if in
   God's judiciary it is more particularly the Father who justifies the
   ungodly, and in the preparing of salvation more particularly the Son
   who in His Incarnation and Resurrection brings about justification, so
   it is, in more limited sense, the Holy Spirit particularly who reveals
   this justification to the persons of the elect and causes them to
   appropriate it to themselves. It is by this act of the Holy Spirit that
   the elect obtain the blessed knowledge of their justification, which
   only then begins to be a living reality to them.

   For this reason Scripture reveals these two positive, but apparently
   contradictory truths, with equally positive emphasis: (1) that, on the
   one hand, He has justified us in His own judgment seat from eternity;
   and (a) that, on the other, only in conversion are we justified by
   faith.

   And for this reason faith itself is fruit and effect of our
   justification; while it is also true that, for us, justification begins
   to exist only as a result of our faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXXIII.

  Certainty of Our Justification.

   "Being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in
   Christ Jesus."--Rom. iii. 24.

   The foregoing illustrations shed unexpected light upon the fact that
   God justifies the ungodly, and not him who is actually just in himself;
   and upon the word of Christ: "Now are ye clean through the word which I
   have spoken unto you." (John xv. 3) They illustrate the significant
   fact that God does not determine our status according to what we are,
   but by the status to which He assigns us He determines what we shall
   be. The Reformed Confession, which in all things starts from the
   workings of God and not of man, became again clear, eloquent, and
   transparent. So the divine Word, ordinarily lowered to a mere
   announcement of what God finds in us, becomes once more the fiat of His
   creative power. He found an ungodly man and said, "Be righteous," and
   behold he became righteous. "I said to thee in thy blood, Live." (Ezek.
   xvi. 6)

   In this way the various parts of the redemptive work are arranged
   chronologically each in its own place.

   So long as the false and narrow idea prevailed that a man was justified
   after conversion on the ground of his apparent holiness, justification
   could not precede sanctification, but must follow it. Then man becomes
   first holy, and, as a reward or as a recognition of his holiness, he is
   declared righteous. Hence sanctification is first, and justification
   second; a justification, therefore, without any value, for what is the
   use of declaring that a ball is round?

   The Scripture refuses to acknowledge a posterior justification. In
   Scripture, justification is always the starting point. All other things
   spring from it and follow it. "Christ was made unto us wisdom and
   righteousness," and only then "sanctification and redemption." (1 Cor.
   i. 30) "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we also have access." (Rom. v.
   1) "Being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is
   in Christ Jesus." (Rom. iii. 24) And, "Whom He called, them He also
   justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified." (Rom. viii.
   30)

   For this reason the Reformation made justification by faith the
   starting-point for the conscience, and by this confession bravely and
   energetically opposed Rome's justification by good works; for in this
   justification by good works that priority of sanctification found its
   root.

   The Church of Christ can not deviate from this straight line of the
   Reformation without estranging itself and separating itself from its
   Head and Fountain of Life, vitally injuring itself. Sects which, like
   the Ethicals and the Methodists, [31] detract from this truth sever the
   faith from its root. If our churches desire once more to be strong in
   the doctrine and bold in witness-bearing, they must not repose in
   lethargy on the mere form of the doctrine, but must heartily embrace
   the doctrine; for it presents this cardinal point in a superior and
   excellent manner. He only who heroically dares accept justification of
   the ungodly becomes actual partaker of salvation. He only can confess
   heartily and unreservedly redemption which is sovereign, unmerited, and
   free in all its parts and workings.

   The last question that remains to be discussed is: How can the
   justification of the ungodly be reconciled with the divine Omniscience
   and Holiness?

   It must be acknowledged that, in one respect, this whole representation
   seems to fail. It must be objected:

   "Your argument is wittily thought out, but it does not stand the test.
   When an earthly sovereign decides that a man's state shall be otherwise
   than it actually is, he acts from ignorance, mistake, or arbitrariness.
   And since these things can not be ascribed to God, these illustrations
   can not be applied to Him."

   And again: "That an earthly judge sometimes condemns the innocent and
   acquits the guilty, and makes the former to occupy the status of the
   latter, and vice versa, is possible only because the judge is a
   fallible creature. If he had been infallible, if he could have weighed
   guilt and innocence with perfect accuracy, the wrong could not have
   been committed. Hence if sin had not come in, that judge could not have
   acted arbitrarily, but he would have acted according to the right, and
   decided for the right because it is right. And, since the Lord God is a
   judge who trieth the reins and who is acquainted with all our ways, in
   whom there can be no failure or mistake or ignorance, it is not
   thinkable, it is impossible, it is inconsistent with God's Being, that
   as the just Judge He ever could pronounce a judgment that is not
   perfectly in accordance with the conditions actually existing in man."

   Without the slightest hesitation we submit to this criticism. It is
   well taken. The mistake whereby a boy can be registered as a girl; the
   peasant's child for that of a nobleman; whereby a law-abiding citizen
   can be judged as a law-breaker, and vice versa, is out of the question
   with God. And, therefore, when He justifies the ungodly, as the earthly
   judge declares the dishonorable to be honorable, then these two acts,
   which are apparently similar, are utterly dissimilar and may not be
   interpreted in the same way.

   And yet the correctness of the objection does not in itself invalidate
   the comparison. Scripture itself often compares men's acts, which are
   necessarily sinful, to the acts of God. When the unjust judge, weary of
   the widow's tears and importunity, finally said, "I will avenge her,
   lest she come at last and break my head" (Luke xviii. 5 Dutch
   Translation), the Lord Jesus does not for a moment hesitate to apply
   this action, tho it sprang from an unholy motive, to the Lord God,
   saying: "And shall not God avenge His own elect, who cry night and day
   unto Him?" (Luke xviii. 7)

   It can not be otherwise. For since all acts of men, even the very best
   of the most holy among them, are always defiled with sin, either it
   would be impossible to compare any deed of man with the doings of God,
   or one must necessarily consider such deeds of men apart from the
   sinful motive, and apply to God only the third of the comparison.

   And as Jesus could not mean that at last God must answer His elect,
   "lest they come and break His head," but without speaking of the
   motive, simply pointed to the fact that the inopportune prayer is
   finally heard, so did we compare the wrong decision of the judge,
   declaring the guilty innocent, to the infallible decision of God,
   justifying the ungodly, since, in spite of the difference of motive, it
   coincides with a third of the comparison.

   Moreover, human mistakes are out of the question with reference to the
   granting of pardon and reinstatement. Hence this expression of royal
   sovereignty is indeed a direct type of the sovereignty of the Lord our
   God.

   But this does not settle the question. Altho we concede that the unholy
   motive of mistake can not be attributed to God, yet we must inquire:
   What is God's motive, and how can the justification of the ungodly be
   consistent with His divine nature?

   We reply by pointing to the beautiful answer of the Catechism, question
   60: "How art thou righteous before God? Only by a true faith in Jesus
   Christ; so that, tho my conscience accuse me, that I have grossly
   transgressed all the commandments of God, and kept none of them, and am
   still inclined to all evil; notwithstanding, God, without any merit of
   mine, but only of mere grace, grants and imputes to me the perfect
   satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ; even so as if I
   never had had, nor committed any sin: yea, as if I had fully
   accomplished all that obedience which Christ hath accomplished for me;
   inasmuch as I embrace such benefit with a believing heart."

   That the Lord God justifies the ungodly is not because He enjoys
   fiction, or delights by a terrible paradox to call one righteous who in
   reality is wicked; but this fact runs parallel with the other fact,
   that such an ungodly one is really righteous. And that this ungodly
   one, who in himself is and remains wicked, at the same time is and
   continues righteous, finds its reason and ground in the fact that God
   puts this poor and miserable and lost sinner into partnership with an
   infinitely rich Mediator, whose treasures are inexhaustible. By this
   partnership all his debts are discharged, and all those treasures flow
   down to him. So tho he continues, in himself, poverty-stricken, he is
   at the same time immensely rich in his Partner.

   This is the reason why all depends upon faith in the Lord Jesus Christ;
   for that faith is the bond of partnership. If there is no such faith,
   there can be no partnership with the wealthy Jesus; and you are still
   in your sin. But if there is faith, then the partnership is
   established, then it exists, and you engage in business no longer on
   your own account, but in partnership with Him who blots out all your
   indebtedness, while He makes you the recipient of all His treasure.

   How is this to be understood? Is it the Person of the Christ who takes
   us into partnership? And, since God has no longer to reckon with our
   poverty, but can now depend upon the riches of Christ, does He
   therefore count us good and righteous? No, brethren, and again, no! It
   is not so, and it may not so be presented; for then there would be no
   justification on God's part. You have a bill to collect from a man who
   failed in business, but who was accepted as the partner of a rich
   banker, who discharged all his debts. Is there now the slightest mercy
   or goodness on your part, when you indorse that man's check? Doing
   otherwise, would you not flatly contradict solid and tangible facts?

   No, the Lord God does not act that way. Christ does not blot out the
   debt, and obtain us treasure outside of God; nor does the ungodly
   enter, through faith, into partnership with the wealthy Jesus
   independently of the Father; neither does God, being informed of these
   transactions, justify the ungodly, who already had become a believer.
   For then there would be no honor for God, nor praise for His grace; it
   would be not the ungodly, but, on the contrary, a believer that was
   justified.

   The matter is not transacted that way. It was the Lord God, first of
   all, who, without respect of person, and hence without respect to faith
   in the person, according to His sovereign power, chose a portion of the
   ungodly to eternal life; not as judge, but as Sovereign. But being
   judge as well as Sovereign, and therefore incapable of violating the
   right, He who has chosen, that is, the Triune God, has also created and
   given all that is necessary and required for salvation; so that these
   elect persons, at the proper time and by appropriate means, may receive
   and undergo the things by which in the end it will appear that all
   God's doing was majesty and all His decision just.

   And, therefore, this whole ordering of the Covenant of Grace; and in
   this Covenant of Grace the ordering of the Mediator; and in the
   Mediator that of all satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness; and of
   that satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness, first the imputation,
   and after that the gift.

   Wherefore God does indeed declare the ungodly just before he believes,
   that he may believe, and not after he believes. This justifying act is
   the creative act of God, in which is also deposited the satisfaction,
   righteousness, and holiness of Christ, and from which flow also the
   imputation at a granting of all these to the ungodly. Wherefore there
   is in this act of justification not the slightest mistake or untruth.
   He alone is declared just who, being ungodly in himself, by this
   declaration is and becomes righteous in Christ.

   In this way alone it is possible fully to understand the doctrine of
   justification in all its wealth and glory. Without this deep conception
   of it, justification is merely the pardon of sin, after which, being
   relieved of the burden, we start out with newly animated zeal to work
   for God. And this is nothing else than genuine, fatal Arminianism.

   But, with this deeper insight, man acknowledges and confesses: "Such
   pardon of sin does not avail me. For I know:

   "1st. That I shall be again daily defiled with sin;

   "2d. That I shall have a sinful heart within me until the day of my
   death;

   "3d. That until then, I shall never be able to accomplish the keeping
   of the whole law;

   "4th. That, since I am already condemned and sentenced, I can not do
   business in the Kingdom of God as an honorable man."

   The answer of justification, such as Scripture reveals and our Church
   confesses it, covers these four points most satisfactorily. It accepts
   you not as a saint, with a self-assumed holiness, but as one who
   confesses: "My conscience accuses me that I have grossly transgressed
   all the commandments of God, and have kept none of them, and that I am
   still inclined to all evil"; and yet, you are not cast out. It tells
   you that you can not depend upon any merit of your own, but must rely
   on grace alone. Wherefore it begins with putting you in the ranks of
   the law-abiding, of them that are declared good and righteous, "even so
   as if you never had had nor committed any sin." As the ground of
   godliness it does not require of you the keeping of the law, but it
   imputes and imparts to you Christ's fulfilment of the law; esteeming
   you as if you had fully accomplished all that obedience which Christ
   has accomplished for you. And effacing hereby the difference of your
   past and future sin, it imputes and grants unto you not only Christ's
   satisfaction and holiness, but even His original righteousness, in such
   a manner that you stand before God once more righteous and honorable,
   and as tho the whole history of your sin had been a dream only.

   But the closing sentence of the Catechism should be noticed: "Inasmuch
   as I embrace such benefit with a believing heart." And that "believing
   heart," and that "embracing"--behold, that is the very work of the Holy
   Spirit.

  Faith in General.

   "Through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of
   God."--Ephes. ii. 8.

   When the judicial act of the Triune God, justification, is announced to
   the conscience, faith begins to be active and expresses itself in
   works. This leads us to call the attention of our readers to the work
   of the Holy Spirit, which consists in the imparting of faith.

   We are saved through faith; and that faith is not of ourselves, it is
   the gift of God. It is very specially a gift of the Triune God, by a
   peculiar operation of the Holy Ghost; "No man can say that Jesus is the
   Lord but by the Holy Ghost" (1 Cor. xii. 3). St. Paul calls the Holy
   Spirit the Spirit of faith (2 Cor. iv. 13). And in Gal. v. 22 he
   mentions faith as the fruit of the Holy Spirit.

   In salvation nearly everything depends upon faith: hence a correct
   conception of faith is essential. It has always been the aim of error
   to poison faith's being, and thus to destroy weak souls as well as the
   Church itself. It is therefore the urgent duty of ministers to instruct
   the churches concerning faith's being and nature; by correct
   definitions to detect prevailing error, and thus to restore the joy of
   a clear and well-founded consciousness of faith.

   For years the people have listened to the poorest and vaguest theories
   of faith. Every minister has had his own theory and definition, or
   worse, no definition at all. In a general way they have felt what faith
   is, and presented it eloquently; but these brilliant, metaphorical,
   often flowery descriptions have frequently been more obscuring than
   illuminating; they have failed to instruct. The definition of faith
   being left to the inspiration of the moment, it often occurred that the
   minister unconsciously offered to his people on Sunday the very
   opposite of what he had eloquently proclaimed the week before. This
   should not be so. The Church must increase in knowledge also; and what
   sufficed for the apostolic Church is not sufficient now. The ideas of
   faith were confused then; and the earliest writings show that the
   various problems regarding faith had not been solved.

   But not so in the apostolic writings, whose inspiration is proven from
   the fact that they contain a clear and definite answer to nearly all
   these questions. But after the apostles had passed away, the depth of
   their word not yet understood, there was a childlike confusion of ideas
   in the Church of the first centuries; until the Lord allowed various
   heretical forms of faith to appear, which the Church was compelled to
   oppose by the real forms of faith. To do this successfully it had to
   emerge from that confusion and to arrive at clearer distinctions and
   conceptions.

   Hence the many differences, questions, and distinctions which
   subsequently arose regarding faith's being and exercise. Owing to the
   earnest debates, the real being of faith became gradually more defined
   and clearly distinguished from its false forms and imitations. That in
   the present time every path, good and bad, has its own distinctive
   sign-post, so that no one can turn in the wrong direction ignorantly,
   is the fruit of the long conflict waged with so much patience and
   talent.

   Undoubtedly ignorance has caused much misunderstanding. But we maintain
   that a guide who neglects to examine the roads before he undertakes to
   guide travelers is unworthy of his title. And a minister of the Word is
   a spiritual guide, appointed by the Lord Jesus to conduct pilgrims
   traveling to the heavenly Jerusalem through the high Alps of faith,
   where the ordinary communications of the earthly life have ceased, from
   one mountain-plateau to another. Hence he is inexcusable when, merely
   guessing at the location of the heavenly city, he advises his pilgrims
   to try the path which seems to lead in that direction. By virtue of his
   office he should make it his chief business to know which is the
   shortest, safest, and most certain way, and then tell them that this
   and none other is the way. Formerly, when the various paths had not yet
   been examined, it was to some extent praiseworthy to try them all; but
   now, since their misleading character is so well known, it is
   unpardonable to try them again.

   And when the easy-going people say, "Above all things let us retain our
   simplicity; what is the use in our Christian faith of all those
   wearisome distinctions," we would ask of them whether in the case of a
   surgical operation they would prefer a surgeon who in his simplicity
   only cuts no matter where or how; or in case of sickness, an apothecary
   who simply puts a mixture together from his various jars and bottles,
   regardless of the names of the drugs; or, to take another example, in
   case of a sea-voyage, would they embark in a vessel whose captain,
   chary of the use of charts and instruments, in sweet simplicity steers
   his ship, merely trusting in his luck?

   And when they answer, as they must, that in such cases they demand
   professionals thoroughly acquainted with the smallest details of their
   professions, then we ask them in the name of the Lord and of their
   accountability unto Him, how they can go to work so simply, i.e., so
   carelessly and thoughtlessly, when it concerns spiritual disease, or
   the voyage across the unfathomable waters of life, as tho in these
   matters thoughtful discrimination were immaterial.

   We refuse, therefore, to be influenced by that sickly talk about
   simplicity regarding faith, or by the impious cry against a so-called
   dogmatism, but shall diligently seek to give an exposition of the being
   of faith, which, eradicating error, will point out the only safe and
   reliable path.

   As a starting-point, let it be plainly understood that there is a sharp
   distinction between saving faith and the faith which in the various
   spheres of life is called "faith in general."

   When Columbus is incited, by internal compulsion, to direct his
   restless eye across the western ocean to the world which he there
   expects with almost absolute certainty, we call this faith; and yet,
   with this instinctive inclination in the mind of Columbus saving faith
   has nothing to do. And the preacher, using this and similar examples
   otherwise than as a faint analogy, does not explain but obscures the
   matter, and leads the Church in the wrong direction.

   Sometimes we have among our children one whose mind is constantly
   occupied by an unconscious aim or idea, that leaves him no rest. In
   after years it may appear to be his life's aim and purpose. This is the
   compulsion of an inward law belonging to his nature; the mysterious,
   constraining activity of a ruling idea governing his life and person.
   People thus constrained conquer every obstacle; however opposed, they
   come ever nearer to that unconscious purpose, and at last, owing to
   this irresistible impulse, they attain what they have been so long
   aiming at. And this is also frequently called faith; but it has little
   more than the name in common with the faith of which we are about to
   speak. For while such faith excites human energy, and exalts and
   glorifies it, saving faith, on the contrary, casts down all human
   greatness.

   The same is true of the so-called faith in one's ideas. One is young
   and enthusiastic; he dreams beautiful dreams of a golden age of
   happiness and sees delightful ideals of righteousness and glory. That
   beautiful world of his fancy seems to comfort him for the
   disappointments of this matter-of-fact world. If that were the real
   world, and if it were always to remain so, it would have broken his
   youthful heart and prematurely quenched its enthusiasm; and, grown old
   when still young, he would have joined the pessimists who perish in
   despair, or the conservatives who find relief in the silencing of the
   higher dictates of the conscience. But fortunately their number is
   small. In this painful experience many discover a world of ideals,
   i.e., they have the courage to condemn this sinful world, full of
   misery, and to prophesy of the coming of a better and happier world.

   Alas! youthful presumption, chasing after its ideals, often fancies
   that the cause of all evils lies in the fathers. "If my fathers had
   only seen and planned things as I do now, our progress would have been
   much greater." But those fathers did not see it so. They went wrong;
   hence our ideals are not yet real. But there is hope; a young
   generation, clearly understanding these things, will soon be heard;
   then great changes will occur: much of the existing misery will
   disappear, and our ideal world will become real. And cruel is the
   answer of unvarnished experience. For the son acts as foolishly as the
   father did before him. Consequently the ideal world is not realized. He
   cries aloud, but men will not hear; they refuse to be delivered from
   their misery, and the old sadness goes on forever.

   At this point the company of idealistic men is divided. Some abandon
   the effort; call their dreams delusive, and, accepting the inevitable,
   increase the broad stream of souls trampled down to the same level. But
   a few nobler souls refuse to submit to this debased and ignoble
   wretchedness; and preferring to run their heads against the granite
   wall, with the cry, "Advienne qui pourra," cling to their ideals. And
   these men who can not be sufficiently loved and appreciated are said to
   believe. But even this faith has nothing in common with saving faith;
   to speak of this as the same is but profusion of tongues and a joining
   together of things dissimilar.

   Finally, the same is true of a much lower form, ordinarily called
   faith, which is the light-hearted expression of cheerfulness; or the
   lucky guessing at something which accidentally comes to pass. There are
   cheery, mirthful souls, who in spite of adversity never seem to be cast
   down or harmed, who, however much suppressed, have always enough of
   elasticity in their happy spirits to let the mainspring of their inward
   life rebound into full activity. Such people have always an encouraging
   and hopeful eye for all their surroundings. They are strangers to
   gloomy forebodings, and unacquainted with melancholy fears. Care does
   not rob them of sleep, and nervous restlessness does not send the blood
   to the heart at quickened pace. However, they are not indifferent, only
   not easily affected. Things may go against them, the clouds may
   overcast their sky, but behind the clouds they see the sun still
   shining, and they prophesy, with cheerful smile, that light will soon
   break through the darkness. Therefore it is said that they have faith
   in persons and in things.

   And this faith, if it be not too superficial, should be appreciated.
   With millions of melancholy souls, life in this country would be
   unbearable; and it is cause for gratitude that our national character,
   otherwise so phlegmatic, cultivates sons and daughters in whose hearts
   the faith of the cheerful burns brightly. And sometimes their
   prophecies are really fulfilled; everybody thought that the little
   craft would perish, and, behold, it safely reached and entered the
   harbor; and it appeared that their cheerful faith was actually one of
   the causes of its happy arrival. And then these prophets ask you: Did
   we not tell you so? Were you not altogether too gloomy? Do you not see
   that it came out all right?

   But even this faith has nothing but the name, in common with saving
   faith. We must note this especially because, in Christian institutions
   and enterprises, we frequently meet with men and women who are upheld
   by this spirit of cheerfulness and unquestioning confidence, and who by
   this hopeful spirit pilot many a Christian craft, which otherwise might
   perish, into a safe harbor. But this spiritual cheerfulness which, in
   the Christian, is perhaps fruit of the genuine faith, is by no means
   the genuine faith itself. And when it is said, "Do you now see what
   faith can do?" the saving faith is again confounded with this general
   faith which is found sometimes even among the heathen.

  Faith and Knowledge.

   "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that
   believeth not the Son shall not see Life."--John iii. 36.

   In the discussion of saving faith, faith in general can not afford us
   the least assistance. To understand what "faith" is, we must turn in an
   entirely different direction, and answer the question: "What is, among
   the nations, the universal root-idea and original significance of
   faith?"

   And then we meet this singular phenomenon, that among all nations and
   at all times faith is an expression denoting at one time something
   uncertain, and at another something very certain.

   It may be said: "I believe that the clock struck three, but I am not
   certain"; or, "I believe that his initials are H. T., but I am not
   certain"; or, "I believe that you can take a ticket directly for St.
   Petersburg, but it would be well first to inquire." In every one of
   these sentences, which can be translated literally in every cultivated
   language, "to believe" signifies a mere guess, something less than
   actual knowledge, a confession of uncertainty.

   But when I say, "I believe in the forgiveness of sin"; or, "I believe
   in the immortality of the soul"; or lastly, "I believe in the
   unquestionable integrity of that statesman"; "to believe" does not
   imply doubt or uncertainty about these things, but signifies strongest
   conviction concerning them.

   From which it follows, that every definition of the being of faith must
   be wrong which does not explain how, from one and the same root-idea,
   there can be derived a twofold, diametrically opposed use of the same
   word.

   Of this difficulty there can be but one solution, viz., the difference
   in the nature of the things in regard to which certainty is desired; so
   that, with reference to one class of things, highest certainty is
   obtained by faith, and, with reference to another, it is not.

   This difference arises from the fact that there are things visible and
   invisible, and that certainty regarding things visible is obtained by
   knowledge and not by faith; while certainty in regard to things
   invisible is obtained exclusively by faith. When a man says regarding
   visible things, "I believe," and not, "I know," he impresses us as
   being uncertain; but in saying regarding invisible things, "I believe,"
   he gives us the idea of certainty.

   It should be observed here that the expressions "visible" and
   "invisible" must not be taken in too narrow a sense; by things visible
   must be understood all things that can be perceived by the senses, as
   in Scripture; and by things invisible, the things that can not be so
   perceived. Wherefore the things that pertain to the hidden life of a
   person must ultimately rest on faith. His deeds alone belong to the
   visible things. Certainty in regard to these can be obtained by the
   perception of the senses. But certainty regarding his inward
   personality, his thoughts, his affections and their sincerity, his
   character and its trustworthiness, and anything pertaining to his
   inward life, certainty regarding all these can be reached by faith
   only.

   If we were to enter more deeply into this matter, we should maintain
   that all certainty, even regarding things visible, rests always and
   only upon faith; and we should lay down the following propositions:
   When you say that you saw a man in the water and heard him cry for
   help, your knowledge rests, first, upon your belief that you did not
   dream but was wide awake, and that you did not imagine but actually saw
   it; second, upon your firm belief that since you saw and heard
   something there must be a corresponding reality which occasions that
   seeing and hearing; third, upon your conviction that in seeing
   something, e.g., the form of a man, your senses enable you to obtain a
   correct impression of that form.

   And, proceeding in this way, we could demonstrate that in the end, all
   certainty in regard to things visible, as well as to things invisible,
   rests ultimately not upon perception, but upon faith. It is impossible
   for my ego to obtain any knowledge of things outside of myself without
   a certain bond of faith, which unites me to these things. I must always
   believe either in my own identity, that is, that I am myself; or in the
   clearness of my consciousness; or in the perception of my senses; or in
   the actuality of the things outside of myself; or in the axiomata from
   which I, proceed.

   Hence it can be stated, without the slightest exaggeration, that no man
   can ever say, "I know this or that," without its being possible to
   prove to him that his knowledge, in a deeper sense and upon closer
   analysis, depends, so far as its certainty is concerned, upon faith
   alone.

   But we prefer not to consider this deeper conception of the matter,
   because it confuses rather than explains the being of faith; for it
   should be remembered that in Sacred Scripture the Holy Spirit always
   uses words as they occur in the ordinary speech of daily life, simply
   because otherwise the children of the Kingdom could not understand
   them. And, in the daily life, people do not make that closer
   distinction, but say, in the case of love referred to: "I know that
   there is a man in the water, for I saw his head and I heard him cry."
   While, on the other hand, it is said, in the ordinary speech of daily
   life: "If you do not believe me, I can not talk with you"; indicating
   the fact that, in regard to a person, faith is the only means by which
   certainty can be obtained.

   And, keeping this in view, we shall, for the sake of clearness, present
   the matter in this way: that the Lord God has created man in such a way
   that he can obtain knowledge of two worlds, of the world of visible
   things, and of that of invisible things; but so that he obtains such
   knowledge concerning each in a special and peculiar manner. He obtains
   knowledge of the world of visible things by means of the senses, which
   are instruments designed to bring his mind into contact with the
   outside world. But the senses teach him nothing concerning the world of
   invisible things, for which he needs altogether different organs.

   We have no names for these other organs, as we have for the five
   senses; yet we know that from that invisible world we receive
   impressions, sensations, emotions; we know perfectly well that these
   mutually differ in duration, depth, and power; and we also know that
   some of these affect us as real and others as unreal. In fact the
   invisible world, as well as the visible world, exerts influences upon
   us; not through the five senses, but by means of unnamable organs. This
   influence from the invisible world affects the soul, the consciousness,
   the innermost ego. This working makes impressions upon the soul,
   excites sensations in the consciousness, and causes emotions in the
   inward ego.

   This is done, however, in such a way that there is always room for the
   question: "Are these impressions real? Can I trust these sensations? Is
   there a reality corresponding to these sensations, impressions,
   emotions?" And to this last question faith alone can answer "yes," in
   precisely the same manner as the question, whether I obtain certainty
   from my own consciousness and from my senses and from the axiomata,
   receives its "yes" exclusively and only by faith.

   To obtain certainty regarding the things invisible, such as love,
   faithfulness, righteousness, and holiness, the mystic body of the
   Lord--in a word, regarding all things that pertain to the mystery of
   the personal life in my fellowmen, in Immanuel, in the Lord our God,
   faith is the proper and only divinely ordained way; not as something
   inferior to knowledge, but equal to it, only much more certain, and
   from which all knowledge derives its certainty.

   As regards the objection, that the Sacred Scripture declares that faith
   shall be turned into sight, we say that this "sight" has nothing in
   common with the sight by means of the senses. God sees and knows all
   things, and yet He does not possess any of the senses: His sight is an
   immediate act of penetration, with His Spirit, into the essence and
   consistence of all things. To Adam in Paradise something of this
   immediate wisdom and knowledge was imparted; but by sin he lost that
   glorious feature of the image of God. And Scripture promises that this
   glorious feature shall be restored to God's children, in the Kingdom of
   Glory, in much more glorious measure than in Paradise.

   But, while we still sojourn as pilgrims, not yet possessing the
   glorified body any more than the glory of our inward status, our
   contact with the invisible world does not yet consist in sight; our
   mind still lacks the power to penetrate immediately into the things
   invisible; and we still depend upon the impressions and sensations
   produced by them. Wherefore we can have no certainty regarding these
   impressions and sensations, except by direct faith. Still, existing and
   living as pilgrims together, we believe in each other's love, good
   faith, and honesty of character; we believe in God the Father, in our
   Savior, and in the Holy Spirit; we believe in the Holy Catholic Church;
   we believe in the forgiveness of sin, the resurrection of the body, and
   the life everlasting. And we do not believe in all these with the
   secret after-thought that we would really prefer to know them, instead
   of believing them; for that would be just as absurd as to say, of an
   organ concert: "Really I would prefer to see this." Music can not be
   seen any more than one can become conscious of things invisible by
   means of the senses. And as the sense of hearing is the only proper
   means of hearing and enjoying music, so faith is the peculiar and only
   means whereby certainty can be obtained regarding our contact with the
   world unseen and invisible.

   This being thoroughly understood, it can not be difficult to see that
   this faith in reference to things visible is far inferior to knowledge;
   for the visible things are intended to be ascertained, carefully and
   accurately, by means of the senses. Imperfect observation renders our
   knowledge uncertain. Hence, in regard to the visible things, no other
   knowledge than that obtained by the senses ought to be considered
   reliable.

   But in a number of unimportant cases accurate knowledge is needless;
   e.g., in the difference concerning the respective heights of two
   steeples. In such cases we use the word "believe," as, "I believe that
   this steeple is higher than the other." And again, visible things
   impress their image upon the memory, which in the course of years
   becomes dim. Meeting a gentleman I have seen before, and fully
   recognizing him, I say, "This is Mr. B."; but being uncertain, I say,
   "I believe that this is Mr. B." In this case we seem to be dealing with
   visible things, for a gentleman stands before us; yet the image which
   recalls him belongs to the inward contents of the memory. Hence the
   difference of speech.

   We reach, therefore, this conclusion:

   First, that all certainty regarding things visible as well as invisible
   depends in the deepest sense upon faith.

   Second, that in ordinary speech certainty regarding things visible is
   obtained by means of the senses, and regarding things invisible,
   especially things that pertain to personality, by believing.

   For this reason Brakel's effort to interpret the verb to believe,
   according to the Hebrew and Greek idioms, as meaning to trust, and not
   as a means to obtain certainty, was a failure. Such meanings are the
   same in all languages, and there is no difference, because they are the
   direct result of the organism of the human mind, which, in its
   fundamental features, is the same among all nations. Confidence is the
   direct result of faith, but is not faith itself.

   "To believe" refers, in the first place, to the certainty or
   uncertainty of the consciousness concerning something. If there is no
   such certainty, I do not believe; being consciously certain, I believe.
   When a person introduces himself to me as a man of integrity, the first
   question is, whether I believe him. If I am not certain that he is a
   man of integrity, I do not believe him. But if I believe him,
   confidence is the immediate result. Then it is impossible not to trust
   him. To believe that he is what he claims to be, and not trust him, is
   simply impossible.

   Hence "to believe" always retains the primary meaning of "assuring the
   consciousness"; and saving faith requires me "to be certain that Christ
   is to me such as He reveals and offers Himself in Sacred Scripture."

  Brakel and Comrie. [32]

   "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
   you."
   --Phil. iii. 15.

   We call the attention of our readers to the two lines which in the last
   century were most correctly drawn by Brakel and Comrie respectively;
   and we do not deny that of the two, Comrie was the more correct.

   This is not intended to hurt the friends of Brakel, for then we should
   wound ourselves. However, altho the name of "Father Brakel" is still
   precious to us; altho we appreciate his courageous protesting against
   church tyranny, and heartily acknowledge our indebtedness to his
   excellent writings; yet this does not render him infallible, neither
   does it alter the fact that in the matter of faith Comrie judged more
   correctly than he.

   To do justice to both men, we will cite their respective arguments, and
   then show that Comrie, who did not always see correctly either, was
   more strictly Scriptural, and therefore more strictly Reformed, than
   Brakel.

   In the chapter on Faith ("Rational Religion," ii., 776, ed. 1757),
   Brakel writes:

     "The question is: What is the essential, fundamental act of faith?
     Is it the assent of the mind to the Gospel and its Promises, or is
     it the trusting of the heart in Christ for justification,
     sanctification, and redemption? Before we answer this question we
     wish to say:

     "First, that by trusting' we do not understand a Christian's
     assurance and confidence that he is in Christ and a partaker of
     Christ and of all His promises; nor his peace and rest in Christ,
     for that is a fruit of faith which some have more than others; but
     by trusting we understand the act of the soul, whereby a man yields
     himself to Christ and accepts Him, entrusting Him with body and
     soul, as, e.g., one man entrusts his money to another, or as one
     entrusts himself to and leans on the strong shoulders of the man
     that carries him across a stream.

     "Second, that such trust necessarily requires a previous knowledge
     of evangelical truth and assent to its credibility; and that, after
     that, faith exercises itself on and by its promises.

     "We now answer the question already stated as follows: True, saving
     faith is not the act of the mind assenting to evangelical truth, but
     the trusting of the heart to be saved by Christ on the ground of His
     voluntary offering of Himself to sinners and of the promises to them
     that trust in Him. And we say also that faith has its seat, not in
     the understanding, but in the will; not being the assent to the
     truth it can not be in the understanding, and since it is trust it
     must have its seat in the will.

     "The truth of what we have said is evident:

     "First, from the name itself. What we call to believe' Scripture
     calls to trust,' to confide,' to entrust.' Speaking of divine things
     revealed to us in the Word alone, we must not be confined to our own
     language, for this would cause many to fall into error; but we
     should adapt our speech and understanding to the nature and
     character of the original Hebrew and Greek. For in our language to
     believe' means to accept promises and the narrative of events on the
     strength of another man's word; but according to the force of the
     original languages the words, (GR. pi iota sigma pi epsilon w/tronos
     upsilon omega, HEB. He w/segol Aleph w/hataf segol Mem w/hiriq Yod
     Nun, KAf w/qamats Mem w/patah lamed, other text ) are translated not
     only to believe,' but to trust,' to entrust,' to lean upon.' They
     are used, not to denote the nature of trust, but by trusting
     yielding oneself to Christ, relying on Him.

     "Secondly, the Scripture ascribes the act of faith to the heart:
     With the heart man believeth unto righteousness' (Rom. x. 10); If
     thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he said, I
     believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God' (Acts viii. 37).
     Trusting and believing are both acts of the heart, the will. If it
     be said that the heart refers also to the understanding, we answer,
     very rarely, and even then it refers not to the understanding alone,
     but also to the will, or to the soul with all its workings.

     "Thirdly, if the act of faith did consist in the assent of the mind
     to the truth, it would be possible to have saving faith without
     accepting Christ, without trusting Him; and you may know and
     acknowledge Christ as the Savior as long as you please, but what
     union and communion with Christ does that afford? To accept Christ
     and to trust and lean on Him would be only an effect of faith, but
     an effect does not complete the being of a thing which is complete
     before the effect; and saving faith would not differ from historic
     faith, but be the same in its nature. For historic faith, is also
     the assent of the mind to the truth of the Gospel, and even the
     devils and the unconverted have this faith. If it be said that the
     knowledge of the one is spiritual and that of the other is not, we
     answer: (1) While it is true that the knowledge of the converted is
     different from that of the unconverted, yet the matter remains the
     same. Their historical knowledge, if assented to, is historic faith
     in the one as well as in the other. (2) The Scripture never makes
     the spirituality of historic knowledge the distinctive feature of
     saving faith. (3) This is certain that the knowledge of faith of an
     unconverted person is not spiritual. And from faith itself one can
     never ascertain whether he truly believes; this he can learn only
     from the fruits, and that would be altogether wrong.

     "Fourthly, saving faith believes in God, in Christ, and does not
     stop at the Word, but through the Word reaches the Person of Christ
     and trusts in Him. Neither do I pray for these alone, but for them
     also who shall believe on Me, through their word' (John xvii. 20).
     This alone gives faith its point, nature, and perfection; wherefore
     Scripture says that saving faith is to believe in God, in Christ:
     Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved' (Acts xvi.
     31). To believe in Christ is faith itself and not the fruit of
     faith, which it must be if faith be mere knowledge and assent.

     "Fifthly, it is faith itself that unites the soul to Christ,
     appropriates the promises, satisfies the conscience, gives access to
     the throne of grace and boldness to call Him Father (Ephes. iii. 17;
     John iii. 36; Rom. v. 1; Ephes. iii. 12). But mere assent to the
     truth cannot do any of these things. You may assent as long as you
     please, but that will never make a single promise your own; it will
     not unite the soul to Christ, nor will it give boldness to call
     Abba, Father.' Hence mere assent is not saving faith. It may be said
     that it is the work of the assenting mind to accept Christ and to
     trust in Him, and so the above-mentioned results flow from the
     assent of the truth. But I answer: (1) That mere assent as such can
     not have such results, but that they are its fruits; that the assent
     must first work acceptance and trust in Christ; hence it is the form
     of faith, and not its nature. Moreover, Scripture ascribes all these
     things to faith itself, not to its fruits. (2) The same may be said
     of the knowledge of the mysteries of the Gospel, that it has the
     same effect, that this also unites to Christ, appropriates the
     promises, etc.; but since this would be absurd, it is also absurd to
     say that mere assent works these things. And therefore it is certain
     that saving faith is not assent, but trust.

     "Sixthly, the opposite of saving faith is not the rejection of the
     truth of the Gospel, but failure to trust in Christ. He that
     believeth on the Son': He that obeyeth not the Son' (John iii. 36,
     Dutch Translation); Let not your heart be troubled--believe: also in
     me' (John xiv. 1); Where is thy faith?' (Luke viii. 25). In the last
     text faith is contrasted with fear. Hence true faith is not assent,
     but trust."

   Brakel's characteristic is that he considers faith, not as an inherent
   habit, but as an outgoing act of the heart; and, in connection with
   this, that the organ of faith and its seat are not in the
   understanding, but chiefly in the will.

   Comrie, on the other hand, taught that faith is the increated and
   inherent habit, the principal moment of which is to be persuaded.

   In his "Explanation of the Heidelberg Catechism" (ii., 312) we read:

     "The question, What is true faith?' is very important, deserving
     most careful consideration; for they only that have true faith can
     be saved. For altho in faith itself there is no inherent saving
     power, God has established such a connection between salvation and
     the imparted faith, that without the latter no person young or old
     can be saved. Children as well as adults must hereby be incorporated
     into Christ; for there is no salvation in any other.

     "This question is terribly wrested and distorted by those that
     always speak of faith as an act or acts. Reading the definition of
     faith (Heidelberg Catechism, question 21), they say that this
     describes, not the nature and character of faith, but its perfection
     and highest degree. We will see how the Reformers have defined faith
     as an instrument according to the true foundation of the divine
     Word, in harmony with the doctrine of free grace and in its relation
     to justification, and not according to the principle of works of the
     semi-Pelagians, as many now do; who also say that the authors of the
     twenty-first question did not describe the true faith of which the
     preceding answer had shortly spoken, showing that they only can be
     saved that are engrafted into Christ and receive all His benefits by
     a true faith; but that they described the works of faith. But how is
     it possible that the authors of the Catechism could forget what they
     had just stated as the essential condition of salvation for every
     man, and speak of a high and perfect degree of faith, which is not
     attained by every one of the redeemed, if we take the words of the
     Catechism in their actual sense? No, beloved, the question refers to
     the same faith of which we have been speaking, the faith essential
     to all, children as well as adults; i.e., the imparted faith, which
     we have defined as an imparted faculty and habit, wrought in the
     elect by the Holy Ghost with re-creating and irresistible power,
     when they are incorporated into Christ; by which they receive all
     the impressions which God the Holy Ghost imparts unto them through
     the Word (regarding children in a manner unknown to us), and by
     which they are active according to the nature and the contents of
     the Word, the objects of which are revealed to their souls. Hence
     the reality or sincerity of the imparted faith does not depend upon
     the acts of faith, but the sincerity of these acts depends upon the
     reality and sincerity of the faculty or habit from which they
     spring; so that; altho no acts spring from it, as in deceased elect
     children, yet they possess the true faith, from which acts would
     have sprung if they had been able to employ their rational
     faculties.

     "Moreover, the imparted faith develops all its powers, not in an
     instant, but gradually; and altho one act does not appear as
     strongly pronounced as another, this is no sign of insincerity; but
     it is the sign that such act or acts are not apparent. E.g., the
     sense of taste can be perfect altho one never tasted sweetness, and
     to form an idea of sweetness is then impossible; yet when sweetness
     is tasted the idea is not produced by a new faculty to taste
     sweetness, but by a new object, which excites the faculty and
     produces the idea which was not possessed before.

     "The same is true of the inwrought faith; with reference to the
     habit of faith it is imparted and perfected by the supernatural
     operation of the Holy Spirit in a moment, but it does not act until
     the soul becomes conscious of it. And this is why some men, who by
     reason of the bondage of fear of death all their lifetime were never
     assured of their state in Christ, could still be saved. However, we
     do not dwell upon this point; we wish only to say that the answer
     describes the real nature and character of imparted faith as a
     faculty, whereby we receive the knowledge of all that God has
     revealed to us in His Word, and as a confidence that Christ and His
     grace are freely given us of God,

     "Hence it is evident--

     "First, that faith consists in a conviction or persuasion. This is
     the genus of faith. Faith, whether human or divine, is impossible
     without a conviction of the mind of the reality of the matter which
     is believed. When this is lacking there is no faith, but only a
     guess, a fancy, or a supposition.

     "Secondly, that this conviction or persuasion is the product or act,
     not of faith as such, but of the testimony which is so convincing
     and persuading that its truth cannot be doubted. This is the nature
     of all persuasion; the soul in order to be persuaded does not act,
     but merely receives the proofs of the matter in question, and
     becomes so deeply convinced that it is no longer at liberty either
     to reject or accept that conviction, but must yield itself with
     greatest willingness to the truth.

     "Thirdly, that according to the degree of clearness wherewith the
     divine testimony, as with an argument, impresses the imparted faith
     concerning the matters of our lost estate and the way of salvation,
     the conviction of the truth or of the contents of the testimony
     shall be more or less firm and persuasive.

     "Lastly, that as faith is wrought by a testimony, so it is also made
     active by a testimony of God's Word, rendered by an operation of the
     Holy Spirit. Being therefore in the adult, the daughter of the Word
     (Bathkol, filia vocis), it is also from beginning to end subject to
     the Word, obeying and in all things following it. For among the
     Reformed this is an established rule, that through the operation of
     the Holy Spirit we first receive a faculty, from which subsequent
     activities proceed; and that this imparted faculty does not work of
     its own energy except it be wrought upon (acti agimus: being enabled
     we act) by the Word and the omnipotent power of the Holy Spirit
     accompanying that Word, in which and by which it enters and
     penetrates the soul as its instrument and organ, to excite the soul
     to activity and to flow into that activity.

     "Concerning faith itself it should be remembered--

     "First, that nearly all the old and private confessions of various
     martyrs, since the year 1527, have thus understood the imparted
     faith, as our Heidelberg theologians describe it, in the answer of
     the twentieth question in general, and in that of the twenty-first
     more particularly.

     "Secondly, we must call your Christian attention to the acts which
     flow from the imparted faith. Theologians entertain different
     opinions regarding the number of these acts of faith, and which is
     the proper act of faith, just a word regarding both. In regard to
     the number, the celebrated Witzius mentions nine: three preceding,
     three proper, and three that follow. We do not object; every man is
     free to express himself as he pleases. Yet we prefer the ancient
     method which holds that faith consists of three things: knowledge,
     assent, and confidence. We have no doubt that all that God's Word
     teaches regarding faith can easily be arranged under each of these
     three acts. Concerning the proper act of faith, which is called the
     actus formalis fidei; i.e., the formal act of faith, the following
     opinions are held: (1) that it is the assent; (2)that, it is the
     coming to Christ; (3) the accepting of Christ; (4) a certain
     confidence in Christ; and lastly, that it is love. The discussions
     of the theologians on this point are violent, and many tracts are
     written by the various parties either to establish their own
     opinions or to refute those of others.

     "Beloved, we judge that we could let this matter pass without
     noticing it, were it not for the fact that this definition may favor
     the semi-Pelagians in this respect, who hold that faith is an act,
     and that it receives its formal being by an act: Forma dot esse rei'
     (the form gives existence to the matter). And seeing that some begin
     to deviate, we say: That no act or acts can give faith its form or
     being. For this would imply that the imparted faith which the Holy
     Spirit works in the elect is an unformed faith, lacking that which
     is essential to its being. And this is absurd, since by this implied
     actus formalis' there is ascribed to us more than to the Holy
     Spirit; yea, a great deal more, inasmuch as the form is more
     excellent than the material. According to this supposition He
     imparts to us only the material of faith, without its form; and by
     our act or acts we give form to that formless faith."

   Our principal aim in citing was that the student might receive the
   contrast from the very lips of these two men, and so discover that the
   slight deviation of Amesius from Calvin and Beza in Brakel already
   inclines too much to the subjective; and that the objective character
   of saving grace is sufficiently covered only by the line of Augustine,
   Thomas, Calvin, Zanchius, Voetius, Comrie. Brakel was right in opposing
   the petrified dogmatism of his day. But when he systematized his
   opposition he went too far in that direction. In exactly the same
   manner as KÃ¶hlbrugge was right when, in opposition to his
   contemporaries, he maintained the objective as rigidly as possible,
   while his followers go wrong when they systematize his then necessary
   opposition.

   Following the line of Augustine, Calvin, Voetius, Comrie, one goes
   safest.

  Faith in the Sacred Scriptures.

   "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth
   confession is made unto salvation."
   --Rom. x. 10.

   Calvin says beautifully and comprehensively that the object of saving
   faith is none other than the Mediator, and invariably in the garments
   of the Sacred Scriptures. This should be accepted unconditionally.
   Saving faith is possible, therefore, only in sinful men and so long as
   they remain sinful.

   To suppose that saving faith existed already in Paradise is to destroy
   the order of things. In a sense there was no need of salvation in
   Paradise, because there was pure and undisturbed felicity; and for the
   development of this felicity into still greater glory, not faith, but
   works, was the appointed instrument. Faith belongs to the "Covenant of
   Grace," and to that covenant alone.

   Hence it may not be said that Jesus had saving faith. For Jesus was no
   sinner, and therefore could not have "that assured confidence that not
   only to others, but to Him also, was given the righteousness of the
   Mediator." We have only to connect the name of Jesus with the clear and
   transparent description of saving faith by the Heidelberg Catechism to
   show how foolish it is for the Ethical theologians to explain the
   words, "Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith," as tho He had
   saving faith like every child of God.

   Hence saving faith is unthinkable in heaven. Faith is saving; and he
   that is saved has obtained the end of faith. He no longer walks by
   faith, but by sight. It should therefore be thoroughly understood that
   saving faith refers only to the sinner, and that Christ in the garments
   of the Sacred Scripture is its only object.

   Two things must, therefore, be carefully distinguished: faith in the
   testimony concerning a person, and faith in that person himself.

   Let us illustrate. A ship is ready to sail, but lacks a captain. Two
   men present themselves to the shipowner; both are provided with
   excellent testimonials signed by creditable and trustworthy persons. Of
   the absolute truth of these testimonials the shipowner is thoroughly
   convinced. And yet in spite of this testimony one is engaged and the
   other dismissed. Conversing with both, the owner has found the first a
   very reasonable fellow, readily allowing him, as the owner of the ship,
   to issue orders; in fact, as captain he would have nothing to say. But
   the other, a real sailor, demanded absolute control of the ship,
   otherwise he would not take the responsibility. And, since the
   shipowner enjoyed issuing orders, he preferred the meek and tractable
   captain and dismissed the rough sailor. Consequently the tame
   commander, obeying orders, lost the ship the first voyage, while the
   rival ship commanded by that Jack-tar returned home laden with a rich
   cargo.

   We distinguish here two kinds of faith. First, faith or no faith in
   testimony presented; second, faith or no faith in the persons to whom
   this testimony refers. In the illustration, faith of the first kind was
   perfect. Those testimonies were accepted as genuine; the shipowner had
   perfect faith in the signatures. And yet it did not follow that he was
   immediately ready to entrust his property to either one of these
   captains. This required another faith; not only faith in the contents
   of those papers, but faith also that these contents would prove true
   regarding the command of his ship. Hence he carefully considered both
   men, and discovering that the one left no room for his self-assertion,
   it was natural that he engaged the other, who flattered his egotism.
   And, influenced by this egotism, he did not place that second faith in
   the right person. His neighbor, not so egotistically inclined, kept the
   end in view, had faith in the bold seaman, and his profits were almost
   fabulous. Hence both men had unconditional faith in the testimonies;
   but the one, denying himself, had also faith in the excellent captain,
   and the other, refusing to deny himself, had not.

   Apply this to our relation to Christ. That vessel is our soul. It is
   tossing upon the waves and needs a pilot. The voyage is long, and we
   ask: "Who will safely pilot it?" Then a testimony is laid before us
   concerning One wonderfully skilled in the art of safely guiding souls
   into the desired haven. That testimony is Sacred Scripture, which
   throughout all its pages offers but one, ever-continued, divine
   testimony concerning the unique excellence of the Christ as leading
   souls to the safe haven. With this testimony before us, it is for us to
   decide whether we will accept it or not. Its rejection ends the matter,
   and Jesus will never be the Guide of our soul. But, accepting it,
   saying, "We believe all that is written," we can proceed. This
   confession implies: (1) faith in the genuineness of the testimony; (2)
   faith in God who gave it; and (3) faith in the truth of its contents.

   But this is not saving faith, only faith in the testimony. To believe
   that it will prove true in our case, in our own persons, is quite
   different. This depends, not upon the testimony, but upon whether we
   will submit ourselves to Him of whom it speaks. Altho this Captain
   pilots souls safely across very deep waters, He does not pilot all
   souls. They must, be able and willing to submit themselves to Him
   according to His demands. The unwilling are left behind, and, trying to
   pilot themselves, they miserably perish. Hence we must submit. And this
   requires the laying aside of all our self-conceit, the utter casting
   out of self. So long as self stands in the way we refuse Him as our
   spiritual Guide; nor do we believe in His power. But as soon as self is
   cast out, the ego silenced, and the soul abandons itself to Him, the
   second faith awakens, and, upon bended knee, we cry: "My Lord and my
   God!"

   It is exactly as our Catechism beautifully and comprehensively
   expresses it: "That true faith consists of two things, first, a certain
   [33] knowledge whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us
   in His Word; but also an assured confidence, which is a firm and
   stedfast confidence, which the Holy Ghost works by the Gospel in my
   heart; that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin,
   everlasting righteousness, and salvation are freely given of God;
   merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits."

   Examining more closely what these two points have in common, we find,
   not that the one is knowledge and the other confidence, but that both
   consist in being persuaded.

   With the testimony laid before him, the natural man is inclined to
   reject it. He has many objections. "Is it genuine?" "Was it not
   affected by various alterations? Can I rely on the truth of its
   contents?" For a long time he continues his resistance: He says: "No
   man can ever convince me; I believe a great deal, but not that
   impossible scripture." But the Holy Spirit continues His work. He shows
   him that he is wrong; and, altho still resisting, it becomes like a
   fire in his bones until opposition is made impossible, and he confesses
   that God is true and His testimony genuine.

   However, this is not all. He still lacks the second faith: whether this
   applies to him personally. He begins with denying it. "It does not mean
   me," he says; "Jesus does not save a man like myself." But here the
   Holy Spirit meets him again. He brings him back to the Word. He holds
   the image of the saved sinner before him until he recognizes himself in
   that image. And tho he still objects, "It can not be so; I only deceive
   myself," yet the Holy Spirit persists in persuading him until, wholly
   convinced, he appropriates Christ to himself and acknowledges: "Blessed
   be God, that saved sinner am I." Wherefore it is not first knowledge
   and then confidence, but both are an inward persuasion by the Holy
   Ghost. And the man thus persuaded believes. He that is persuaded of the
   truth of the divine testimony concerning the Guide of souls believes
   all that is revealed in the Scripture. And being also persuaded that
   the saved sinner described in Scripture is himself, he believes in
   Christ as his Surety.

   Hence the peculiar feature of faith in both its stages is to be
   persuaded. Saving faith is a persuasion, wrought by the Holy Spirit,
   that the Scripture is a true testimony concerning the salvation of
   souls, and that this salvation includes my soul.

   Is the Heidelberg Catechism wrong, then, in speaking of knowledge and
   of confidence? No; but it should be noticed that it speaks, not of
   faith's origin, but of its fruit and exercise, it being already
   established. Being persuaded that the Scripture is true, and believing
   the divine testimony concerning Christ; we at once possess certain and
   undoubted knowledge regarding these things. And being persuaded that
   that salvation includes my soul, I possess by virtue of this persuasion
   a firm and assured confidence that the treasure of Christ's redemption
   is also my own.

   Hence faith has three stages: (1) knowledge of the testimony; (2)
   certainty of the things revealed; and (3) persuasion that this concerns
   me personally. These used to be called knowledge, assent, and
   confidence; and we are willing to adopt them, but they must be used
   carefully. By the first must be understood nothing more than the
   obtaining of knowledge independently of faith. Hence the Heidelberg
   Catechism omits this as not belonging to faith proper, and mentions
   only assent and confidence. For that certain knowledge of which it
   speaks is not what the scholastics put in the foreground as knowledge;
   but what they call assent. Knowledge is not the emphatic word, but
   certainty. [34] It is not the knowledge, but the certainty of the
   knowledge that belongs to the true faith.

   Wherefore some used to distinguish knowledge and assent, and treated
   them separately. For it should be remembered that the unconverted do
   not understand the Scripture, nor can they read its testimony. Not
   being born of water and of the Spirit, they can not see the Kingdom of
   God. The natural man does not understand spiritual things. Hence we say
   emphatically, that the knowledge preceding faith and to which faith
   must assent implies the illumination of the Holy Spirit. Only in that
   light can one see the glory of Scripture and apprehend its beauty;
   without this it is but a stumbling-block to him. Yet it is no part of
   faith, but only part of the Spirit's work making faith possible.

   A truth or a person is not faith, but the object of faith; faith itself
   is to be persuaded when, all opposition ended, the soul has obtained
   undoubted assurance. Hence the absolute absurdity of speaking of faith
   cut loose from Scripture, or directed upon anything but Christ; or of
   calling faith a universal inclination of the soul, crying after
   salvation, to quench its thirst. All this robs faith of its character.
   When I say, "I believe," I mean thereby that this or that is to me an
   undoubted fact. In order to believe one must be assured, convinced,
   persuaded--otherwise there can be no faith; and the fruit of this being
   persuaded is rich knowledge, glorious confidence, and access to the
   Lord.

   However, it should be noticed that we have spoken of faith only as it
   shows itself above the ground. But that is not sufficient. We must
   still examine the root, the fibers of faith in the soul. We must
   examine the faculty that enables the soul to believe. Of this in the
   next article.

  XXXVIII.

  The Faculty of Faith.

   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
   God."--Rom. viii. 14.

   Saving faith should always be understood as a disposition of man's
   spiritual being by which he can become assured that the Christ after
   the Scripture, the only Savior, is his Savior.

   We write purposely a "disposition" by which he can become assured. As
   water is in the pipes, altho not running just now, or as gas is in the
   tubes, altho not burning so by virtue of regeneration is faith present
   as a disposition in man's spiritual being, even tho he believes not
   yet, or believes no more. If the house is connected with the city's
   water-works the water can run; but for this reason it does not always
   run; nor does the gas always burn. That in your house the water can
   flow, and gas can burn, is the difference between your dwelling and
   your neighbor's which is not so connected.

   There is a similar difference between the regenerate and the
   unregenerate; that is, between him who is united to Jesus and him not
   so united. The difference is not that the former believes and always
   believes, but only this, that he can believe. For the unregenerate can
   not believe; he has purposely destroyed the precious and divine gift
   whereby he could have joined himself to the life of God. God gave him
   eyes to see, but he has purposely blinded himself. Hence he does not
   see Jesus. The living Christ does not exist for him. Not so the
   regenerate child of God. True, he also is a sinner; he also has
   purposely blinded himself; but an operation is performed upon him,
   restoring his eyesight, so that now he can see. And this is the
   implanted faculty of faith. This faculty touches the consciousness. As
   soon as the fact that Christ is the only Savior and my Savior, as an
   undoubted, firmly established, and fundamental truth, is introduced to
   my consciousness--which is the clear representation of my whole being,
   and is perfectly adapted and joined to it--I believe.

   But this truth does not suit the consciousness of the natural man. He
   may insert it now and then by means of a temporary or historical faith,
   but only as a foreign element, and his nature immediately reacts
   against it, in precisely the same manner as the blood and tissue react
   against a sliver in one's finger. For this reason a temporary faith can
   never save a man, but, on the contrary, it injures him; for it causes
   his soul to fester.

   The human consciousness as it is by nature, and the Christ after the
   Scripture, are in principle diametrically opposed. The one excludes the
   other. That which suits and fits the consciousness of the natural man
   is the persistent denial of Christ. This natural consciousness is the
   representation of his sinful existence; and since an unconverted sinner
   always asserts himself and thinks himself savable, and proposes to save
   himself, he can not tolerate Christ. Christ is unthinkable to him;
   therefore he can not acknowledge Him. No, there is no need of Him; he
   can save, too, with Jesus, or just as well as Jesus, or after the
   example of Jesus; wherefore this Jesus is by no means the only Savior.

   But if the Christ after the Scripture fits his consciousness, that
   consciousness must have been changed from what it was by nature; and
   being the reflection and representation of his being and all that it
   contains, it follows that to make room for Christ, not to oblige Him,
   but from his own absolute necessity, his being must first be changed.
   Hence a twofold change:

   First, the new birth, changing the position of his inward being.

   Second, the change affecting his consciousness, by introducing the
   disposition to accept Christ. And this disposition, being the organ of
   his consciousness whereby he can do this, is the faculty of faith.

   The fathers have correctly observed that this disposition imparts
   itself also to the will. And it can not be otherwise. The will is like
   a wheel moving the arms of a windmill. In sinless Adam this wheel stood
   squarely upon its shaft, turning with equal ease to the right and to
   the left--i.e., it moved as freely toward God as toward Satan. But in
   the sinner this wheel is partly moved from the shaft, so that it can
   turn only to the left. When he wants to sin, he can do so. In this
   direction the shaft is clear; he has the power to sin. But the wheel
   can not turn the other way; a little perhaps, with much difficulty and
   much squeaking, but never sufficiently to grind corn. The working of
   his will can never produce any saving good. He can not make the wheel
   of his life run with the energy of the will toward God.

   Even after he is inwardly changed, and the faith faculty has entered
   his consciousness, it is useless so long as the powerless will enters
   the consciousness to expel his Christian assurance. Therefore the will
   must be divinely wrought upon to serve the changed consciousness. Hence
   the disposition of faith is imparted not only to the consciousness, but
   also to the will, to adapt itself to the Christ of the Scripture. The
   will of the saint is made to move again freely toward God. When the ego
   is turned and the will changed, then only can the new disposition enter
   the consciousness, to be assured that Christ after the Scripture is the
   only Christ and his Christ.

   The faculty of faith is therefore something complex. It can not be
   independent from the consciousness and knowledge; for it implies a
   change of man's being and the will's liberty to move toward God. Hence
   this faculty is not a spontaneous growth from the implanted life,
   neither is it independent of it; but as a disposition it can enter us
   only after regeneration, and even then it must be given us by the grace
   of God.

   Of course, the man in whom the faculty of faith begins to work believes
   in Scripture, in Christ, and in his own salvation; but without it he
   continues to the end to object against Scripture, Christ, and his own
   salvation. He may be almost convinced; wholly convinced he will never
   be. This is temporary faith, historical faith, faith in ideals, but
   never saving faith.

   But if a man has received this disposition, is it possible for him
   immediately and always to believe? Surely not, no more than a normal
   infant can read, write, or think logically. And when at sixteen he can
   do these things, it is owing not to new faculties received since his
   birth, but to the development of those born in him. A new-born child of
   God possesses the faculty to believe; but there is no immediate and
   actual believing. This requires something more. As a child can not
   learn and develop without teachers and in connection with his own
   environment, so the faculty of faith can not be exercised without the
   guidance of the Holy Spirit in connection with the contents of
   Scripture.

   How this was effected in deceased infants we can not tell; not because
   the Holy Spirit can not work in them as well as in adults, but because
   they do not know the Scripture. However, since the Scriptures testify
   only of Christ, He may have a way to bring the not-thinking child into
   connection with Christ, as He provided Scripture for thinking men.

   In either case, the faith faculty can not produce anything of itself,
   but must be stimulated and developed by the Holy Spirit's training and
   exercise, gradually learning to believe--a training continued to the
   end; for until we die the working of faith increases in strength,
   development, and glory.

   But this is not all. A man may have the faculty of faith fully
   developed and exercised, but it does not follow that therefore he
   always believes. On the contrary, faith may be interrupted for a
   season. Hence faith should not be called the breath of the soul; for
   when a man ceases to breathe he dies. No; the faculty of faith is more
   like the power of a tree to blossom and bear fruit: apparently dead one
   season, and beautiful with blossoms the next. That I possess the
   faculty to think is evident, not from my uninterrupted thinking, for
   when asleep I do not think; but it is evident from my thinking when I
   must think. Even so with the faculty of faith, which occupies the same
   position as the faculties of thinking, speaking, etc.

   Regarding these faculties, we distinguish three things: (1) the faculty
   itself; (2) its necessary development; (3) and its exercise when
   sufficiently stimulated. Hence we notice not only the Spirit's first
   operation, implanting the faith faculty; nor only the second,
   qualifying that faculty for exercise; but also the third, stimulating
   and calling out the act of believing whenever it pleases Him.

   There is no man possessed of the faith faculty but the Holy Spirit has
   thus endowed him. There is no man enabled by this faculty to believe
   but the Holy Spirit has also qualified that faculty. Nor is there a man
   using this qualification, actually believing, unless the Holy Spirit
   has wrought this in him.

   Life has its ups and downs. We see it in our love. You have a child
   whom you love tenderly. But in the daily life you do not always feel
   that love, and sometimes you charge yourself with being cold and
   without warm attachment for the child: But let somebody injure him, or
   let him be taken ill--or worse, let his life be in danger--and your
   slumbering love will at once be aroused. That love did not come to you
   from without, but it dwelt in the depths of your soul, slumbering until
   fully awakened by the sharp sting of sorrow. The same applies to faith.
   For days and weeks we may have to reproach ourselves for the faithless
   condition of our own heart, when the soul seems dry and dead, as tho
   there were no bond of love between us and our Savior. But lo! the Lord
   reveals Himself to us, or distress overwhelms us, or the earnestness of
   life suddenly lays hold of us, and at once that apparently dead faith
   is aroused and the bond of Jesus's love is strongly felt.

   And more than this: inspired by love, you are constantly doing
   something for your darling without saying: "I do this or that for him
   because I love him so much." So also regarding faith: saving faith is a
   disposition whose activity we do not always notice, but like other
   faculties it works continually, its functions unnoticed. Hence we
   frequently exercise faith without being specially conscious of it. We
   prepare ourselves especially to think or speak when special occasion
   calls for it; and so we act from faith with conscious purpose when,
   peculiarly circumstanced, we must boldly stand up as witnesses or make
   some important decision.

   But our comfort is this, that faith's saving power depends, not upon
   some special believing act; nor upon acts less conscious; nor even upon
   the acquired ability of faith, but solely upon the fact that the germ
   of faith has been planted in the soul. Hence a child can have saving
   faith, even tho it never performed a single act of faith. And so we
   continue saved, even tho the act of faith slumbers for a season. The
   man, once endowed with saving faith, is saved and blessed. And when by
   and by the act of faith appears, he is not saved in higher degree, but
   it is only the evidence that, through the infinite mercy of God, the
   germ of faith has been planted in him.

  XXXIX.

  Defective Learning.

   "He that believeth on Him shall not be confounded."--1 Peter ii. 6.

   St. Paul declares that faith is the gift of God (Ephes. ii. 8). His
   words, "And that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God," refer to
   the word "faith."

   A new generation of youthful expositors confidently assert that these
   words refer to "by grace are ye saved." The majority of them are
   evidently ignorant of the history of the exegesis of the text. They
   only know that the pronoun "that" in the clause "and that not of
   yourselves" is a Greek neuter. And without further examination they
   consider it settled that the neuter pronoun can not refer to "faith,"
   which is a Greek feminine.

   Allow us to put our readers on their guard against the thoughtless
   prattle of shallow school-learning. It should be remembered that while
   our exegesis is and always has been the one accepted almost without
   exception, the opposite opinion is shared by only a few expositors of
   later times. Nearly all the church fathers and almost all the
   theologians eminent for Greek scholarship judged that the words "it is
   the gift of God" refer to faith.

   1. This was the exegesis, according to the ancient tradition, of the
   churches in which St. Paul had labored.

   2. Of those that spoke the Greek language and were familiar with the
   peculiar Greek construction.

   3. Of the Latin church fathers, who maintained close contact with the
   Greek world.

   4. Of such scholars as Erasmus, Grotius, and others, who as
   philologists were without peers; and in them all the more remarkable,
   since personally they favored the exposition that faith is the work of
   man.

   5. Of Beza, Zanchius, Piscator, Voetius, Heidegger, and even of Wolf,
   Bengel, Estius, Michaelis, RosenmÃ¼ller, Flatt, Meier,
   Baumgarten-Crusius, etc., who to the present day maintain the original
   tradition.

   And lastly, Calvin, altho he is said to have favored the other
   exegesis. But if he had surrendered the original interpretation, he
   would have given some reason for it; for he was thoroughly acquainted
   with it. And this makes it probable that he never intended to discuss
   the question. That he adhered to the traditional exegesis is proven
   from his own words, in his "Antidote Against the Decrees of the
   Conciliam of Trente" (page 190, edition 1547): "Faith is not of man,
   but of God."

   Even our educated Reformed laymen are acquainted with the fact, if it
   were only from the study of the magnificent commentary on the Ephesians
   by Petrus Dinant, minister at Rotterdam, who flourished in the latter
   part of the seventeenth century. He published it in 1710, and the book
   had such a large sale that it was reissued in 1726; even now it is in
   great demand. We quote from it the following (vol. i., p. 451): "And
   that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.' The word that,' (GR.
   tau omicron upsilon w/tonos tau omicron), refers either to the
   preceding being saved,' or to faith.' To the former it can not refer,
   St. Paul having stated already that salvation is a gift of God. Hence
   it must refer to faith. It is true the Greek (GR. tau omicron upsilon
   w/tonos tau omicron), is a neuter, while (GR. pi iota w/tonos sigma tau
   eta sigma), faith, is a feminine. But Greek scholars know that the
   relative pronoun may refer just as well to the following (GR. delta
   omega w tonos rho omicron upsilon), gift, which is neuter, as to the
   preceding (GR. pi iota w/tonos sigma tau nu sigma), which is feminine,
   according to the rule in Greek grammar governing this point. Hence
   that,' viz., faith, is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God."

   But recent discoveries may have upset this ancient exegesis. If the
   modern expositors of Utrecht, GrÃ¶ningen, and Leyden, who make a hobby
   of this modern exegesis, will therefore show us this recent discovery,
   we will give them an attentive hearing. But they fail to do this. On
   the contrary, they say: "The matter is settled, and so plain that even
   a tyro in Greek can see it." And by saying this, they judge themselves.
   For brains incomparably superior, such as Erasmus and Hugo Grotius,
   knew so much of Greek that they were at least acquainted with the Greek
   rudiments. And we may venture to say that all the Greek scholarship now
   lodged in the brains of our exegetes at the universities just named
   would not half fill the cup which Erasmus and Grotius together filled
   to the brim. Wherefore we confidently maintain the traditional
   exegesis.

   The positive assurance wherewith these young expositors make their
   assertions need not surprise us. The explanation is easily found. They
   were nearly all prepared at universities whose professors of
   New-Testament exegesis seek to estrange their students from the
   traditional interpretation of the Scripture by making surprising
   observations; e.g., the students had learned at home that "the gift of
   God," in Ephes. ii. 8, refers to faith; but they had never consulted
   the original text. Then the professor observed, with perfect
   correctness, that it does not read (GR. alpha w/tonos upsilon tau eta)
   but (GR. tau omicron upsilon w/tonos tau omicron), adding: "The
   gentlemen can see for themselves that this can not refer to faith."
   And, unacquainted with the subject, his inexperienced hearers suppose
   that nothing more remains to be said. If their Greek scholarship had
   been more thorough and extensive, they would have been able to judge
   more independently.

   With this conviction they enter the church; and when a simple layman
   repeats the old exegesis, they delight, at least on such occasions, to
   parade the fruit of their academic training; and the simple layman is
   made to understand that he knows nothing of Greek, and that the Greek
   text plainly reads the other way, and that therefore he may not support
   the antiquated exegesis.

   When sometimes the Heraut [35] dares to repeat the old, well-tried
   opinion, these youthful savants can not help but think: "The Heraut
   does not act in good faith; the editor knows perfectly well that it
   reads (GR. tau omicron upsilon w/tonos tau omicron), and that (GR. pi
   iota w/tonos sigma tau eta sigma) is feminine." Of course, the Heraut
   knows this very well--just as well as Erasmus and Grotius knew it--and,
   knowing a little more of Greek than these childlike rudiments, has
   taken the liberty, supported by the goodly company of the scholars just
   named, to entertain an opinion different from that of the Utrecht
   graduates.

   Undoubtedly every man has a right to his own opinion and to reject the
   traditional exegesis. Moreover, in Phil. i. 23, it is distinctly stated
   that faith is gift of God. But we protest against the shallowness and
   artlessness of men who in their ignorance pose as scholars, and make it
   appear as tho even a tyro in Greek, if he be only an honest man, could
   not support the opposite opinion for a moment. For this is inexcusable
   in one who presumes to pronounce judgment upon another who knows what
   he is talking about, as will appear from the postscript of this
   article.

   The reader will kindly bear with us for treating this matter somewhat
   extensively, for it touches a principle. Our universities deny our
   confession of faith. They may still concede that God is the Author of
   salvation, but faith (such as they interpret it) is taken in the sense
   of a medium which originates from the union of the breath of the soul
   and the inworking of the Holy Spirit. Hence their manifest preference
   for such novel exegesis, apparent also from the energetic and
   persistent effort to popularize it.

   And this tendency is manifest in many other directions. For individual,
   original research there is little opportunity. Hence the instruction
   received at Utrecht is the only source of information. And this is so
   thoroughly rooted in heart and mind that the student can not conceive
   that it can be otherwise. Moreover; the arguments have been presented
   so concisely and incessantly that convincing arguments for opposite
   views seem utterly impossible.

   This being the case, our young theologians, honest in and loyal to
   their convictions, declare from the pulpit and in private conversation
   that uncertainty regarding various doctrinal points is out of the
   question; so that it must be conceded and acknowledged that the ancient
   expositors were decidedly wrong. And this is the cause of the strong
   opposition against many established opinions, even among our best
   ministers; not from love of opposition, but because sincere convictions
   forbid them to follow any other line of conduct, at least as long as
   they are not better informed,

   And this may not remain so. There is no earnestness in that position.
   It is unworthy of the man, scientifically trained; it is unworthy of
   the minister. There is need of individual research and investigation.
   These Utrecht novelties should be received with a considerable grain of
   salt. It may even be freely surmised that the learning of the Utrecht
   faculty, when they oppose the learning of the whole Church, must be
   discredited.

   And thus our young men will be compelled to return to original
   research. Not only that, but they will be compelled to buy books. The
   libraries of nearly all our young theologians contain scarcely anything
   but German works, products of the mediation theology; hence exceedingly
   one-sided, not national, foreign to our Church, in conflict with our
   history. This lack ought first to be supplied. And then we hope that
   the time soon will come when every minister in our Reformed churches
   shall be in the possession of at least a few solid and better works.
   And when thus the opportunity is born for more impartial and more
   correct study, the rising generation of ministers should once more
   resume their studies, and obtain the conviction by their own
   experience, even as others have done, that the work of study and
   research, which will bear good fruit for the Church of God, is not yet
   finished, but really only just begun. Then a generation of more earnest
   and better-trained men will treat the opinions which we have advanced
   with a little more appreciation, and, what is of much higher
   importance, they will treat the being of faith with more
   thoughtfulness.

   It is of vital interest that the exercise of faith and the faculty of
   faith be no longer confounded, and that it be acknowledged the latter
   may be present without the former. Otherwise there will be a complete
   deviation from the line of the Scripture, which is also that of the
   Reformed churches. It will make salvation dependent upon the exercise
   of faith, i.e., upon the act of accepting Christ and all His benefits;
   and since this act is an act, not of God, but of man, we imperceptibly
   lose our way in the waters of Arminianism.

   Hence everything depends upon the correct understanding of Ephes. ii.
   8. For faith is not the act of believing, but the mere possession of
   faith, even of faith in the germ. He that possesses that germ or
   faculty of faith, and who at God's time will also exercise faith, is
   saved, saved by grace, for to him was imparted the gift of God.

   Formerly theologians were used to speak of faith's being and
   well-being; but this had reference to another distinction, which must
   not be confounded with the one thus far treated. Sometimes the plant of
   faith seems more vigorous in one than in another, and its development
   riper and fuller, bearing branch, twig, leaf, blossom, and fruit--which
   is evidence of the well-being of faith. It may also be that, in the
   same person, faith seems to pass through the four seasons of the year:
   there is first a spring-tide, in which it grows, followed by a summer,
   when it blossoms; but there is also an autumn when it languishes, and a
   winter when it slumbers. And this is the transition from the well-being
   of faith to its mere being. But as a tree remains a tree in winter, and
   will possess the being of a tree even tho it have lost its well-being,
   so faith may remain still living faith in us, tho temporarily without
   leaf and blossom.

   For the comfort of souls, our fathers always pointed to the fact, and
   so do we, that salvation does not depend upon the well-being of faith,
   so long as the soul possesses the being of faith. Altho, after the
   example of our fathers, we add, that the tree does not live in winter,
   except it hastens on toward spring, when it shall bud again; and that
   the being of faith gives evidence of its presence in the soul only by
   hastening on toward its well-being.

   Postscript.

   It is necessary to point out two things regarding the shallowness of
   which we complain.

   First, that the construction of a neuter pronoun with a feminine noun
   as its antecedent is not a mistake, but excellent Greek.

   Second, that the Church had reasons why until now she made the words
   "and that not of yourselves" refer to faith.

   In regard to the first point, we refer not to a Hellenistic exception,
   but to the ordinary rule, which is found in every good Greek syntax,
   and which every exegete ought to know.

   A rule which, among others, was formulated by KÃ¼hner, in his
   "AusfÃ¼hrliche Grammatik der Griech. Sprache," vol. ii., I, p. 54 (Han.,
   1870), and which is as follows: "Besonders hÃ¤ufig steht das Neutrum
   eines demonstrativen Pronomens in Beziehung auf ein mÃ¤nnliches oder
   weibliches Substantiv, indem der Begrif desselben ganz allgemein als
   blosses Ding oder Wesen, oder auch als ein ganzer Gedanke aufgefasst
   wird." Which is in English: A neutral demonstrative pronoun is
   frequently used to refer to a preceding masculine or feminine noun,
   when the meaning expressed by this word is taken in a general sense,
   etc.

   The examples cited by KÃ¼hner deal a death-blow to the Utrecht exegesis.
   Take, for instance, these from Plato and Xenophon:

   Plato, "Protagoras," 357, C.:

   Omologoumen epistemes meden einai kreitton, alla touto aei kratein,
   opou an ene, kai edones kai ton allon apanton.

   Plato, "Menon," 73, C.:

   Epeide toinun e aute arete panton esti, peiro eipein kai anamnesthenai,
   ti auto phesi Gorgias einai.

   Xenophon, "Hiero," ix., 9.

   Ei emporia ophelei ti polin, timomenos an o pleista touto poion kai
   emporous an pleious ageiroi.

   To which we add three more from Plato, and a fourth from Demosthenes:

   Plato, "Protag.," 352, B.:

   Pos echeis pros epistemen; poteron kai touto soi dokei osper tois
   pollois anropois, e allos.

   Plato, "Phaedo, "61, A.:

   Upelambanon; . . . kai emoi outo enupnion uper epratton, touto
   epikeleuein, mousiken poiein, os philosophias men ouses megistes
   mousikes, emou de touto prattontos.

   Plato; "TheÃ¦tetus," 145, D.:

   Sophia de g oimai sophoi;-nai-touto de nun diapherei ti epistemes.

   Demosthenes, "Contra Aphob.," 11:

   Ego gar, o anores dikastai, peri tes marturias tes en to grammaeio
   gegrammenes eidos onta moi ton agona, kai peri touton ten psephon umas
   oisontas epistamenos oethen dein k. t. l.

   For the present we postpone the discussion of the second point to
   another time.

   But it is evident that these citations upset all the quasi-learning of
   this defective scholarship; and that the words, "And that not of
   yourselves, it is the gift of God," just with the neutral pronoun, in
   purest Greek, can refer to faith; hence that all this fuss about the
   difference of gender, not only is without any foundation, but also
   leaves a very poor impression regarding the scholarship of the men who
   raised the objection.

   Moreover, we must also show not only that the ancient rendering of
   Ephes. ii. 8 may be correct, but also that it can not be anything else
   but correct.

   It reads: "For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of
   yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should
   boast. For we are His workmanship." (Ephes. ii. 8-10) The principal
   thought is the mighty fact that the causative worker of our salvation
   is God. St. Paul expresses this in the most forcible and most positive
   terms by saying: "You are saved from grace, through grace, and by
   grace." If then it should follow, "And that not of yourselves, it is
   the gift of God," we would have a dragging sentence of superfluous
   clauses, thrice repeating the same thing: "You have received it by
   grace, not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." And this might do, if
   it read, "You are saved by grace, and therefore not of yourselves"; but
   it does not read so. It is simply, "and that not of yourselves." The
   conjunction "and" stands in the way.

   Or, if it read, "Ye are saved by grace, not of yourselves, it is God's
   work," it would sound better. But first to say, "Ye are saved by
   grace," (Eph. ii. 8) and then without adding anything new to repeat,
   "and that not of yourselves," is harsh and halting. And all the more
   so, since in the ninth verse it is repeated for the fourth and fifth
   time, "not of works; we are His workmanship."And while all this is
   stiff and forced, labored and superfluous, by adopting the exegesis of
   the ancient expositors of the Christian Church it becomes all at once
   smooth and vigorous. For then it reads: "You are saved by mere grace,
   by means of faith. (Not as tho by this means of faith the grace of your
   salvation would be partly not of grace; no indeed not, for even that
   faith is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.) And, therefore,
   saved through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast, for we
   are His workmanship."

   But then this creates a parenthesis, which is perfectly true; but even
   this is truly Pauline. St. Paul hears the objection, and refutes it
   again and again, even where he does not formulate the contrast.

  Faith in the Saved Sinner Alone.

   "And they believed in the Scripture."--John ii. 22.

   Faith is not the working of a faculty inherent in the natural man; nor
   a new sense added to the five; nor a new soul-function; nor a faculty
   first dormant now active; but a disposition, mode of action, implanted
   by the Holy Spirit in the consciousness and will of the regenerate
   person, whereby he is enabled to accept Christ.

   From this it follows that this disposition can not be implanted in
   sinless man, and that it disappears as soon as the sinner ceases to be
   a sinner. The saint believes until he dies, but no longer. Or more
   correctly: faith disappears as soon as he enters heaven, for then he
   lives no more by faith, but by sight.

   The importance of this distinction is obvious. The Ethical theologians,
   denying that faith is a specially implanted disposition, but rather a
   sense or its organ, first dormant then awakened, can not admit this,
   but repeat that faith is perpetual, basing their opinion upon 1 Cor.
   xiii. 13. According to their theory, there is no absolute difference
   between the sinner and the sinless; they do not believe that to save
   the sinner the Holy Spirit introduces an extraordinary expedient into
   his spiritual person. Hence their persistent effort to make us
   understand that Adam believed before the fall, and that even Jesus, the
   Captain and Finisher of our faith, walked by faith.

   But this whole presentation is opposed by the apostolic words: "We walk
   by faith, and not by sight" (2 Cor. v. 7). And again, "Now I know in
   part, but then shall I know even as also I am known" (1 Cor. xiii. 12),
   in connection with the preceding: "When that which is perfect is come,
   then that which is in part shall be done away" (vs. 10). And not less
   by the word of our Lord, that we shall see God as soon as we are pure
   in heart (Matt. v. 8).

   And starting from this point, we know positively that faith in the
   sense of saving faith is not perpetual; that it did not exist in
   Paradise, but can only be found in a lost sinner. To be endowed with
   saving faith, he must be a sinner, just as much as relief from pain can
   be given only to one suffering pain.

   Very well," say the Ethicals, "we accept this. But when the physician
   tries to improve the breathing of the asthmatic by making him inhale
   fresh air, it does not follow that a healthy person does not inhale. On
   the contrary, a healthy man inhales strongly and deeply, and it is the
   physician's purpose to assist the normal function of breathing. And the
   same applies to faith. True the Holy Spirit can give faith only to the
   sinner, but a healthy saint, like Adam before the fall and Christ, did
   most assuredly believe; for faith is but the breath of the soul. In
   Adam and Christ this breathing was spontaneous; in sinners like
   ourselves it is disturbed. Hence we need help to be healed. But when
   our souls once more freely inhale the breath of faith, we have received
   only what Adam and Jesus had before us."

   And this we oppose. Saving faith is not the ordinary breath of the
   soul, first disturbed, then restored. No; it is the specific remedy for
   one lost in sin; an expedient extended to him because he became a
   sinner; retained as long as he continues a sinner; withdrawn as soon as
   he ceases from sin. When the expedient is no longer needed, and the
   soul redeemed from sin can breathe freely toward God without the
   expedient of faith, wholly restored, entirely redeemed, then only he
   receives once more that natural, spontaneous communion with the Eternal
   which needs no intervening aid, but which is like that of holy Adam and
   Jesus.

   Faith is like a pair of glasses, not only useless, but hurtful to good
   eyes; very helpful for diseased or weak eyes. So long as eyes are
   abnormal, glasses are indispensable; before they became abnormal,
   glasses were useless (Adam before the fall). Eyes never abnormal never
   needed them (Jesus). As soon as wholly restored, they are laid aside
   (the redeemed in heaven).

   Next in order is faith in connection with Sacred Scripture; and here
   the error of the Ethicals becomes very apparent. Their theory, that
   sinless Adam and Christ exercised faith, and that the redeemed, in
   heaven still believe, leads away from Scripture. In Paradise, sinless
   Adam had no Scripture; neither has Christ on the throne; and in death
   the redeemed forever lose their Bible. Hence it is the logical
   consequence of this error that the faith of the Ethicals is possible
   without Scripture, and is not necessarily intended for Scripture.
   According to their theory, to believe is the soul's breathing, but
   little more than another name for prayer. Indeed, there should have
   been no Scripture, and in the absence of sin there would have been
   none; hence faith, which is only the restoration of a soul-function
   disturbed by sin, is possible without Scripture.

   This theory is far-reaching. They believe that even among the heathen
   the Lord had His elect, tho they never had heard of the Scripture. The
   heathen of classic times were a sort of unbaptized Christians, entering
   the Kingdom of heaven under the leadership of their patriarch Plato.
   Tho modern rationalists reject Scripture, yet they are such lovely and
   devoted people that faith can not be denied them. Reasoning in this
   way, they arrive at the following conclusions:

   1. Not the Confession, but the motive of the heart is the main thing;
   and

   2. Tho men claim to have discovered intentional frauds in Scripture,
   and therefore reject it, they are still "brethren beloved."

   The consistency is evident. Wherefore ministers loyal to the Word
   should be careful how they speak of the being of faith, lest they feed
   the evil which they seek to restrain. All that vague and flowery talk
   about faith as the breath of the soul, as the soul's sweet trust of
   love, etc., has a direct tendency toward Ethical error. For the line is
   a dividing-line. Do you acknowledge or deny it?

   The Ethicals deny it. There is no settled boundary between God and man,
   but a certain transition between the finite and infinite in the
   God-man; no absolute separation between the elect and the lost, but a
   sort of gradual transition in the presentation of a universal
   redemption; no absolute separation between sin and holiness, but a
   certain conciliation in the sanctification of the saints, no absolute
   separation between life before and after death, but a bridge across the
   chasm in the state of believing. Nor is there between the Bible and the
   books of men, but a kind of affinity in the legends of Scripture; and,
   finally, not between the condition with or without faith, but a
   transfer from the one into the other in the preparatory workings.

   The practical result of this false standpoint is the belief in a medium
   between believers and unbelievers, viz., a third state for troubled
   souls. Or we may call it philosophy; but then it is earthborn, in its
   pantheistic obstinacy refusing to admit the absolute contrast between
   the Creator and the creature, and boldly interpreting Scripture's
   ministry of reconciliation in the sense of an essential system, i.e.,
   the blending of one being with another.

   Scripture is diametrically opposed to this: "And God divided the light
   from the darkness"; (Gen. i. 4) "And God divided the waters from the
   dry land"; "And God divided the day from the night." Hence all who
   acknowledge the absolute separation between faith and unbelief must
   array themselves in direct opposition to the Ethicals. This explains
   the cause of our ecclesiastical conflict.

   They that deny the contrasts and efface the divinely ordained
   boundaries must be irenical; i.e., they must contend that a breach in
   the Church can not be allowed. The fatal inference of their pantheistic
   tendency is "No breaches, but bridges." Hence our position antagonizes
   this standpoint along the whole line of our ecclesiastical and
   theological life, with definite, stern, and absolute consistency:
   particular grace, or Christ pro omnibus; only two states, or three;
   direct regeneration, or universal, preparatory operations; no divided
   Church, or a Church loyal to the Word of God; a God-man, or a Mediator
   between God and man; a Scripture absolutely inspired, or full of
   enlightened human opinions; and regarding faith, a disposition
   expressly brought into the sinner, or the restoration of a
   soul-function. Hence there is opposition all along the line.

   From this the relation between Scripture and faith is easily
   ascertained. Both exist for the sake of the sinner by virtue of sin,
   and to remove sin; the one not without the other, both belonging
   together. Without Scripture faith is an aimless gazing. Without faith
   Scripture is a closed book.

   Experience proves it. Persons endowed with the faculty of faith, but
   ignorant of Scripture or wrongly instructed, make no progress; once
   instructed, they live and gain strength. On the contrary, to persons
   familiar with Scripture from their youth, but without faith, the Bible
   is a closed book; the Word can not enter them. But when both Scripture
   and saving faith bless the soul, then the glory of the Holy Spirit
   appears; for it was He who first granted the particular grace of
   Scripture, and then also that of faith.

   This is the reason why the arguments for the truth of the Scripture
   never avail anything. A person endowed with faith gradually will accept
   Scripture; if not so endowed he will never accept it, tho he should be
   flooded with apologetics. Surely it is our duty to assist seeking
   souls, to explain or remove difficulties, sometimes even to silence a
   mocker; but to make an unbeliever have faith in Scripture is utterly
   beyond man's power.

   Faith and Scripture belong together; the Holy Spirit intended the one
   for the other. The latter is so arranged as to be accepted by the
   sinner endowed with faith. And faith is a disposition, completely
   reconciling the consciousness and the Scripture. Hence the "testimonium
   Spiritus Sancti" should be taken, not in the rationalistic or Ethical
   sense of being the operation upon a certain universal disposition, but
   as a real testimony of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in the
   consciousness, and gives us to experience the adaptation--like that of
   the eye to color--of Scripture to faith.

  Testimonies.

   "Without faith it is impossible to please God."--Heb. xi. 6.

   In order to prevent the possibility of being led into paths of error,
   faith is directed, not to a Christ of the imagination, but to "the
   Christ in the garments of the Sacred Scripture," as Calvin expresses
   it.

   And therefore we must discriminate between (1) faith as a faculty
   implanted in the soul without our knowledge; (2) faith as a power
   whereby this implanted faculty begins to act; and (3) faith as a
   result,--since with this faith (1) we hold the Sacred Scripture for
   truth, (2) take refuge in Christ, and (3) are firmly assured of our
   salvation in inseparable love for Immanuel.

   To which must finally be added that this is the work of the Holy Spirit
   alone, who (1) gave us the Holy Scriptures; (2) implanted the faculty
   of faith; (3) caused this faculty to act; (4) made this faith to
   manifest itself in the act; (5) thereby witnessed to our souls
   concerning the Sacred Scriptures; (6) enabled us to accept Immanuel
   with all His treasures; and, lastly, made us find in the love of
   Immanuel the pledge of our salvation.

   Wholly different from this is the historical faith, which Brakel
   briefly describes as follows: "Historical faith is thus called because
   it knows the history, the narrative, the description of the matters of
   faith in the Word, acknowledges them to be the truth, and then leaves
   them alone as matters that concern it no more than the histories of the
   world; for one can not use them in his business, neither does it create
   any emotion in the soul, not even sufficiently to cause man to make a
   confession: Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well, the
   devils also believe and tremble' (James ii. 19). King Agrippa,
   believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest' (Acts xxvi.
   27)."

   Next comes temporary faith, of which Brakel gives the following
   description: "Temporary faith is a knowledge of and a consent to the
   truths of the Gospel, acknowledging them as the truth; which causes
   some natural flutterings in the affections and passions of the soul, a
   confession of these truths in the Church, and an external walk in
   conformity with that confession; but without a real union with Christ,
   to justification, sanctification, and redemption 'But he that received
   the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the Word, and
   anon with joy receiveth it; yet, hath he not root in himself, but
   dureth for a while; for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because
   of the Word; by and by he is offended' (Matt. xiii. 20, 21). For it is
   impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the
   heavenly gift; and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have
   tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if
   they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance' (Heb. vi. 4,
   5). For if, after they have escaped the pollution of the world through
   the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
   therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the
   beginning' (2 Peter ii. 20)."

   There is also a faith of miracles, which Brakel describes in these
   words: "The faith of miracles is a being inwardly persuaded, by an
   inward working of God, that this or that work shall be wrought, in a
   supernatural manner, upon our word or command, in ourselves or in
   others. But the ability to perform miracles is not of man, but of God,
   by His almighty power, in answer to faith: If ye have faith as a grain
   of mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to
   yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto
   you' (Matt. xvii. 20). And tho I have all faith, so that I could remove
   mountains' (2 Cor. xiii. 2). The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly
   beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, said with
   a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked'
   (Acts xiv. 9, 10). This faith was found especially in the days of
   Christ and of the apostles, for the confirmation of the truth of the
   Gospel."

   These three kinds of faith do in some respects resemble saving faith,
   but they lack its being. Least of all is the faith to perform miracles,
   which was found also in Judas. Faith which removes mountains is not
   justifying faith. Historical faith comes a little nearer, unless, by
   reason of a slothfulness and indifference, it merely echoes the words
   of others without accepting their truth, and thus opens the way to
   Pharisaism. Temporary faith comes nearest, which is indeed wrought by
   the Holy Spirit, and affords a taste of the heavenly gifts, but which
   has not root in itself. It is a bouquet of flowers, that for a day
   adorns the breast of the person who wears it, but which, being cut from
   its root, is not a plant in him.

   Finally, we might speak of faith in its most general sense, which is
   the absence of all hesitation, doubt, or obstacle to receiving in
   ourselves the immediate and direct inworking of the holy majesty of
   God, and of the majesty of His truth, in such a penetrating manner that
   spontaneously we believe that the Word and Being of God are the ground
   and foundation of all things. In this general sense St. Paul says that,
   "Without faith it is impossible to please God"; (Heb. vi. 11) and in
   this most general sense faith also belonged to the Lord Jesus Christ.
   But this is not a saving faith, for it has nothing to do with
   salvation.

   Saving faith embraces Christ. How could such Christ-embracing faith
   dwell in Immanuel?

   Rather than to spend our strength in proving this clear fact, we lay
   before our readers Comrie's beautiful exposition of the saving
   knowledge of faith, in which he speaks in the following penetrating
   manner:

     "We will shortly enumerate the objects of this knowledge of faith:

     "First, this knowledge is a divine light of the Holy Ghost, through
     the Word, by which I become acquainted, to some extent, with the
     contents of the Gospel of salvation, which hitherto was to me a
     sealed book; which, altho I understood it after the letter and in
     its connections, I could not apply to myself, to direct and support
     my soul in the great distress, conflict, and anguish which the
     knowledge of God and of myself had brought upon me. But now it
     became plain and knowable to me. Now I learn by the inshining of the
     Holy Ghost the contents of the Gospel, so that I can deal and
     commune with it. And so I suck from these breasts of consolation the
     pure, rational, and unadulterated milk of the everlasting Word of
     God. Truly, the souls that are really humbled by the imparted faith
     do not derive any benefit from their own notions and opinions of the
     truth of the Gospel; on the contrary, they tend to fill them with
     dismay, because their knowledge which is so great is of no use to
     them whatever. I have known men of excellent letter-knowledge who,
     by reason of their natural understanding of the truth, in their
     legal-fear almost cried out in the words of devils: Thou comest to
     torment us before our time.' Only remember Spira and others. I
     believe that the letter-knowledge of the Gospel, which was despised
     here, shall be a hell in hell. For it often occurs that this
     understanding of the letter, which is only an assent to the truth by
     itself, when neglected causes the soul to think: This is not for me,
     but for others.' God knows how many a poor soul sinks away in this
     depth, and is kept there by others who speak boastingly. However,
     when the Holy Spirit causes the divine Gospel to shine into the dark
     prison of the soul, to illuminate the eyes of the inwrought faith
     with a heavenly and divine light, the soul receives the Gospel as
     good news, and as a word of instruction, encouragement, and
     direction; and is led, by it, step by step, as a child, which from
     its A B C learns to spell and read. Now it is: Behold, I see a way
     appear!' And then: Great sinners have been saved, surely there must
     be hope for me!' In the distance the gates of the City of Refuge are
     seen wide open, and Jesus is waiting behind those walls--yea, His
     glory is seen shining through the gates. And in this way, by means
     of the heavenly light, which pours in upon the inwrought faith, the
     soul obtains knowledge of the secret of the Lord in Christ, who is
     revealed to her. How often this knowledge causes the soul to go out
     in holy desires, we need not tell. Many seem to attain with one step
     or bound the highest degree; but, like noble exotics, the true faith
     grows slowly, step by step, from preceding depths of humiliation,
     until it is perfected in actual work and exercise.

     Second, this knowledge is a divine light of the Holy Spirit in,
     from, and through the Gospel, by which I know Christ, who is its
     Alpha and Omega, as the glorious, precious, excellent, and
     soul-rejoicing Pearl and Treasure hid in this field. Altho I knew
     all things, and I did not know Jesus by the light of the Spirit, my
     soul would be a shop full of miseries; a sepulcher appearing
     beautiful without, but within full of dead men's bones. And this
     knowledge of Christ, imparted to the soul by the inshining of divine
     light, through the Gospel, can never from itself give any light to
     the soul so long as it is not accompanied by the immediate inworking
     and illumination of the Holy Spirit. For it is not the letter which
     is effectually working in the soul, but the direct working of the
     Holy Spirit by means of the letter.

     "And now you may ask, In what respect must I know Jesus? We will
     confine ourselves to the following matters: This knowledge of faith,
     the object of which is Christ in the Gospel, is a knowledge by which
     I know, through the divine light of the Holy Spirit, my absolute
     need of Christ. I see that I owe ten thousand talents, and that I
     have not a farthing to pay; and that I must have a surety to pay my
     debts. I see that I am a lost sinner, who is in need of a Savior. I
     see that I am dead and impotent in myself and that I need Him who is
     able to quicken me and to save me. I see that before God I can not
     stand, and that I need Him as a go-between. I see that I go astray,
     and that He must seek after me. Oh! the more this necessity of
     Christ presses upon me, from this true knowledge of faith, the more
     earnest, intense, heart-melting, and persevering the outgoings of my
     soul are from the inwrought faith, and attended with greater
     conflict., Many do not appreciate them because they, do not have
     them, but, being the effects of the Holy Spirit and the results of
     the inwrought faith, they are pleasing to God, to whom they are
     directed. For He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and will
     not despise their prayer--Psalm cii. 17.

     "Third, it is through this knowledge that I, by the light of the
     Spirit, know Jesus in the Gospel, as adapted in every respect to my
     need. It is the very conviction of the fitness of a thing which
     persuades the affections to choose that thing above every other;
     which makes one resolute and persevering in spite of every obstacle,
     never to abandon the determination to secure to himself the thing or
     person chosen for this fitness to his need. You can see it in the
     matter of marriage.

     "A young man may judge it absolutely necessary for him to marry. And
     yet, altho convinced of this necessity, he is groping in the dark.
     Now he is fully determined, and to-morrow he is not. Now he wants
     this woman, and the next day another. But as soon as he meets a
     person whom he considers adapted to him in every respect, he is
     fully resolved. This fitness is the arrow that penetrates his soul,
     and that causes the scale of his unsettled affections to turn in
     favor of the congenial object. Hence nothing can draw him away from
     her so long as he considers her adapted to himself; if need be he
     will work for her as a slave twice seven years which time will seem
     to him but as so many days by reason of the hope to call her his own
     in the end.

     "And this can easily be applied to the spiritual. It shows that
     altho one may be convinced of his need of Christ as his Savior, yet
     so long as he does not see and know Him by faith as wonderfully
     adapted to his person in particular, the affections are not drawn to
     Him. From which it follows that many, in ordinary soul-trouble, act
     so undecidedly: to-day they desire Christ, and to-morrow they do
     not. This moment they wish to be converted, and the next they do
     not. This is the reason that many who once were touched by Christ's
     fitness to their need, and therefore were seekers after Him for a
     season, go back again and no more ask for Him, simply because they
     do not think Him so much adapted to their need as to be able for His
     sake to bear the heat of the day and the cold of the night, or
     sacrifice all things, to possess Him. And this proves that they
     never have known His real fitness, that they never have seen it with
     the eye of faith; otherwise the seed of God would have remained in
     them. But when the divine light of the Holy Spirit, in the Gospel,
     illuminates my soul, and I receive this knowledge of faith from
     Jesus, oh! then I see in Him such fitness as a Surety, a Mediator, a
     Prophet, Priest, and King that my soul is touched in such a measure
     that I judge it impossible to live another happy hour, except this
     Jesus becomes my Jesus. My affections are inclined, taken up,
     directed, and settled upon this object, and my resolution is so
     great, so determined, so immovable, that if it required the loss of
     life and property, of father and mother, sister, brother, wife and
     child, right eye or right hand--yea, tho I were condemned to die at
     the stake, I would lightly esteem all this, and would suffer it with
     joy, to have this wonderfully fit Savior to be my Savior and my
     Jesus. Oh! my friends, examine your hearts, for, from the very
     nature of the case, anything less than this will not suffice. If you
     possess this you will joyfully part with all your sins, you will bid
     an eternal and joyful adieu to your most cherished lusts and bosom
     passions; it will make you count all your righteousnesses, which you
     esteemed a gain, nothing but loss, rejecting them as unprofitable
     refuse, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ; it will make
     you take joyfully the spoiling of your goods; it will make you count
     it an honor, with the apostle, to be scourged for Christ's sake; it
     will make you say: Tho I have not yet found Him, and am only seeking
     after Him, whom my soul loveth, and altho I dare not say, My Beloved
     is mine and I am His, yet if I were to labor for Him twice seven
     years, and spend them in groaning and weeping, in tears and
     supplications, I would count them but as so many days, if only at
     last I might find Him to be my own. God Himself must fix your mind
     upon these things; these results are the infallible signs of the
     inward root of the matter.

     "Fourth, this knowledge of faith is a divine light of the Holy
     Spirit by which I know Christ in the Gospel in all His sufficient
     fulness. By this I see not only that He is well disposed toward poor
     sinners such as myself--for a man might be favorably disposed toward
     another to assist him in his misery, but he might lack the power and
     the means to do so, and the best that he could do might be to pity
     the wretch and say, I pity your misery, but I can not help you'--but
     this divine light teaches me that Christ can save to the uttermost;
     that tho my sins are as scarlet and crimson, heavier than the
     mountains, greater in number than the hairs of, my head and the
     sands of the seashore, there is such abundance of satisfaction and
     merits in the satisfaction, by virtue of His Person, that, tho I had
     the sins of the human race, they would be, compared to the
     satisfaction of Christ, which has by virtue of His Person an
     infinite value, as a drop to a bucket and as a small dust in the
     balance. And this convinces my soul that my sin, instead of being an
     obstacle, much rather adds to the glory of the redemption, that
     sovereign grace was pleased to make me an everlasting monument of
     infinite compassion. Formerly, I always confessed my sin
     reluctantly; it was wrung from my lips against my will only because
     I was driven to it by my anguish, for I always thought, The more I
     confess my sin, the farther I will be from salvation and the nearer
     my approach to eternal condemnation; and, fool that I was, I
     disguised my guilt. But, since I know that Jesus is so
     all-sufficient, now I, cry out, much more with my heart than with my
     lips, Tho I were a blasphemer and a persecutor and all that is
     wicked, this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
     that Jesus Christ has come into the world to save sinners; of whom I
     am chief.' And, if need be, I am ready to sign this with my blood,
     to the glory of sovereign grace. In this way every believer, if he
     stands in this attitude will feel inclined to testify with me.

     "Fifth, it is this knowledge by which I know, in the light of the
     Holy Spirit shining into my soul through the Gospel Jesus Christ, as
     the most willing and most ready Savior, who not only has the power
     to save and to reconcile my soul to God, but who is also exceedingly
     willing to save me. My God, what is it that has brought about such a
     change in my soul? I am dumb and ashamed; Lord Jesus, to stand
     before Thee, by reason of the wrong I have done Thee, and of the
     hard thoughts which I entertained concerning Thee, O precious Jesus!
     I thought that Thou wast unwilling and I willing; I thought that the
     fault lay with Thee and not with me; I thought that I was a willing
     sinner and that Thou hadst to be entreated with much crying and
     praying and tears to make of Thee, unwilling Jesus, a willing
     Christ; and I could not believe the fault lay with me.'

     "This opposition or controversy often lasts a long time between the
     sincere soul and Christ, and never ends until by the divine light
     one sees the willingness of Jesus. However. it must not be supposed
     that there has been no faith in the soul during that time. But it
     may be said that, altho there has been faith, there has been no
     exercise of faith in relation to this matter. And when this appears,
     the soul says: With great shame and confusion of soul I now see Thy
     willingness. Thou hast given me the evidence of Thy willingness by
     Thy coming into the world, by Thy suffering of the penalty, by Thy
     invitation to me, and by the perseverance of Thy work upon my heart.
     I recall my former unbelieving words, spoken from the deep unbelief
     of my heart, and I cry out': Thou art a willing Christ and I was an
     unwilling sinner. My God, now I feel that Thou art too mighty for
     me, Thou hast persuaded me; and now in this day of Thy power I will
     not and can not hesitate any longer, but with my hand I write it
     down that I will be the Lord's.'

     "The believing knowledge of the willingness of Jesus, in the light
     of the Holy Spirit through the Gospel, makes me see my former
     unwillingness. But as soon as this light arises in the soul the will
     is immediately bent over and submissive. They who say that Jesus is
     willing, but that I remain unwilling, speak from mere theory; but
     they lack the knowledge of faith, and have not discovered this
     truth. For as the shadow follows the body, and the effect the cause,
     so is the believing knowledge of the willingness of Christ toward me
     immediately followed by my willingness toward Him, with perfect
     abandonment of myself to Him. Thy people shall be willing in the day
     of Thy power (Psalm cx. 3).

     "Lastly, by this knowledge through the promise of the Gospel, and by
     the light of the Holy Spirit, I learn to know the Person of the
     Mediator in His personal glory, being so near to Him that I can deal
     with Him. I say, in the promise of the Gospel,' to show the
     difference between a vision of ecstasy like that of Stephen and the
     conceited knowledge of which heretics speak outside of and against
     the Word. The Word is the only mirror in which Christ can be seen
     and known by saving faith. And herein I see Him in His personal
     glory with the eye of faith, so near as I ever have seen any object
     with the bodily eye. For this inwrought faith and the light of the
     Holy Spirit shining thereon brings the Person Himself in substantial
     form to the soul, so that she falls in love with Him, and is so
     enchanted with Him that she exclaims: My Beloved is white and ruddy,
     the chiefest among ten thousand. For His love is stronger than
     death; jealousy is more cruel than the grave; the coals thereof are
     coals of fire, flames of the Lord. Many waters can not quench that
     love; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
     it would be utterly contemned' ( Cant. iii. 10; viii. 6, 7).

     "My beloved, faith embraces not only the words and letters of the
     Gospel, but Christ Himself in them. Faith converses, not with the
     letter alone, but with Christ in the letter. Faith has two
     foundations, the Word and the Substance. It does not build upon, the
     Word alone, which is the letter of the Gospel; but also upon the
     Substance in the Word. viz., Jesus Christ-- 1 Cor. iii. 11. The
     Gospel is a mirror, but if Christ does not appear before the mirror,
     He cannot be seen. And when He presents Himself, it is not the
     mirror which is the end of faith, but the Image seen in the mirror.
     It is wisdom rightly to discern this."

   Is this not beautifully said? The Lord our God grant to many of us this
   rich and pure delight.

  Sanctification.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Of Him ye are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and
   righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption."--1 Cor. i. 30.

   Sanctification is one of the most glorious gifts which, by the Covenant
   of Grace, the Mediator bestows upon the saint. It covers his entire
   mental, spiritual, and physical nature. We should, therefore,
   thoroughly understand it, and learn how to obtain it, and every
   believer, whatever the measure of his faith, should be fully aware of
   his attitude toward it; for erroneous views concerning this will surely
   lead us astray from the living Christ.

   It is foolish to think that, altho present-day heresies have affected
   the doctrines of Christ, Sin, and Regeneration, Sanctification is so
   simple as not to be affected. Yet even ministers fall into this sad
   delusion. Men of spiritual fervor, they strictly oppose heresies
   concerning these others, in their catechetical and pulpit instructions,
   and in their writings; regarding such as fundamental error; but somehow
   they never realize that the doctrine of sanctification can be
   imperiled, and they fail to put the Church on guard.

   Such imperiling was impossible; and so, indeed, they hardly care to
   have sanctification distinguished as a dogma at all. "On the contrary,"
   they say, "It is the beauty of sanctification that it is life; hence
   utterly independent of the mysteries of a dogma. In the life of
   sanctification believers may be charged with neglect, careless living,
   slow progress in brief, with faulty doing and working; for what is
   sanctification but betterment of self and daily growth in holiness? but
   never with faulty confessing, with faulty views of the doctrine; for
   sanctification is not doctrine, but life." In this way they have come
   to deny it the value and dignity of a dogma or doctrine; to make it
   almost synonymous with bettering of life; hence to make it the common
   property of all that try to lead earnest and pious lives.

   Then the idea naturally grew that many persons of unsound doctrine
   might lead more spiritual lives. This supposed fact was even fortified
   with the word of Jesus, that publicans and harlots go into the Kingdom
   of God before us; and the congregations often received the impression
   that rationalism itself might lead to better results than sometimes
   flow from an orthodox belief. And the result was that this so-called
   sanctification led to a weakening of the faith, to a considering of
   purity of doctrine as immaterial; until finally it assumed a hostile
   attitude toward the mysteries of the truth. This was the natural effort
   of confounding self-betterment with sanctification, and of opposing
   life to doctrine as gold to tinsel.

   The spread of these false ideas of sanctification has not benefited
   Christianity in these provinces, but, as in pre-Reformation days, it
   has led the people astray from its pure doctrine.

   Rome once suffered and suffers still from the same evil. Not as tho it
   surrendered or even slighted its doctrine; but, even in the flourishing
   days of its hierarchy, the necessity of reformation of life was so
   strongly felt that it resulted in a one-sided urging of sanctification.
   Its favorite motto was: "Good works." They were of greatest importance:
   not words, but power; not the confession, but the earnestness and
   willingness to do good, not merely in secret, but openly so that men
   could see it! This was carried so far that finally Rome ceased to be
   satisfied with good works as fruit of conversion, and even began to
   look upon them as a primary and meritorious cause of salvation; and
   thus it broke down the mystery of faith by a false preaching of
   sanctification. As now, unintentionally, by the cry, "Not doctrine, but
   life," men are driven, as by iron necessity, first to underestimate the
   value of doctrine, then to disapprove of it, and lastly to pronounce it
   injurious, yea, even dangerous; so did the cry for good works induce
   Rome gradually to divorce the mystery of the forgiveness of sin from
   the cross of Calvary, not in the confession, but in the conscience of
   its members.

   For the sake of clearer insight and safer procedure, we must return to
   the definite teaching that sanctification is a doctrine, an integral
   part of the confession, a mystery, just as much as the doctrine of
   reconciliation, and therefore a dogma. In fact, in the treatment of
   sanctification we penetrate the very heart of the confession, the dogma
   which scintillates in the doctrine of sanctification.

   Of course we are not to divorce sanctification from life. No child of
   God denies that the doctrine has its application in life; there is no
   truth whose operation is not felt in his life. To him every doctrine is
   instinct with life, a live coal, a radiating fire, a lamp always
   burning, a well of living water springing up to eternal life. The
   content of every doctrine, of every mystery, is something in the living
   God or in His creature; the confession of a condition, a power, a
   working, a person who actually exists, who lives, who works. The blood
   of atonement means, not those particular drops which flowed from the
   cross, and were lost in the inhospitable ground of Calvary; but a
   treasure in the living Christ, unceasingly at work in heaven, by which
   He enriches His children on earth, the glorious power of which they
   know and experience.

   And this is true of every mystery, as our confession of the Holy
   Trinity shows, which says of this deepest and most incomprehensible
   dogma: "That God's children know this as well from the testimonies of
   Holy Writ as from the operations of the divine Persons, and chiefly by
   those we feel in ourselves" (art. ix.).

   And this applies to the doctrine of sanctification as well as to all
   other doctrines; for it is not, any more than the other dogmas, the
   confession of a lifeless matter, but the confession of an awful power,
   which lives and works effectually in us. Hence sanctification must be
   preached once again as a doctrine; it must be confessed, examined, and
   studied as a doctrine; to be followed by an appropriate application
   like the preaching of any other doctrine; and godliness, spiritual
   life, and good works will be the result. But to obtain this result a
   clear exposition of the cause and animating power of sanctification is
   necessary.

   When on a cold morning the fire does not burn, and the family suffers,
   it is foolish to say: "Since the fire does not burn remove it, and get
   warm without it." To keep from freezing requires more fire; not the
   fire, but the cause of its failure, must be removed. And this applies
   to sanctification. There is a general and bitter complaint of the
   coldness that has fallen upon the Church; and it requires the powerful
   working of sanctification to save the Church.

   But the means employed frequently show poor judgment. Formerly the
   Church confessed a pure doctrine by which it kept close to the source
   of vital heat which is given us in God's word; and the powers and
   workings deposited in the Mediator for the Church radiated in glorious
   activity. Then the Church flourished and faith celebrated its greatest
   triumphs. It was severely cold without, but, while the world lay
   perishing in its cerements, truth filled the Church with light and
   heat, and the sacred fire of a pure doctrine glowed and sparkled. But
   the light grew dim, and the fire went out; and the Church of God became
   dark and cold. And the saints, half frozen and stiff, became deeply
   conscious of the loss they had suffered, and of the need of light and
   heat. And now, instead of advising them to light the lamp of truth and
   rekindle the fire of the confession, that their souls may be revived
   and comforted, many say: "Dear brethren, there is no salvation in dogma
   or confession; they are utterly unprofitable; nothing remains but to
   kindle light and heat in your souls without them," And thus the Church
   is threatened with death and destruction.

   In quiet assurance of the blessing of God, we proceed in the opposite
   direction, and advise the brethren to fill the lamp of the divine
   mysteries with oil, to put more fuel upon the fire of the confession;
   then there shall be light and heat, and the Church shall be saved. This
   shall be so, provided--and this needs no emphasis--that the doctrine be
   really confessed. To confess is not merely to say, "There is a
   comfortable fire in the house," and then to stay out in the cold; but
   to accept its comfort and benefit for others as well as for ourselves.

   The cry, "Not dogma, but life," is folly and unbelief. Let us rather
   oppose the shallow and unsound teaching of the day. The doctrine should
   be a faithful expression of the mystery; the mystery should stand
   clearly before the spiritual eye and illuminate the soul, as it
   radiates from the living Christ, according to the design of salvation.
   Instead of turning the people away from the doctrine, we should make
   them see how little they understand it; how they have trifled with it,
   and not confessed it; that their soul's welfare requires its earnest
   study, that so the act of confessing may deepen and enrich their
   spiritual life. And then let us imagine, not that the fruit of life
   must still be imported from elsewhere, but that the doctrine, rightly
   confessed, becomes its own instrument to manifest its power in us.

   Thus sanctification should be treated.
     __________________________________________________________________

  II.

  Sanctification Is a Mystery.

   "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,
   perfecting holiness in the fear of. God." --2 Cor. vii. 1.

   Sanctification belongs to the mysteries of faith; hence it can not be
   confessed but as a dogma.

   By this statement we intend to cut off at once every representation
   which makes "sanctification" to consist of the human effort to make
   oneself holy or holier.

   To become more holy is undoubtedly the duty which rests upon every man.
   God has condemned all unholiness, as an accursed thing. Inferior
   holiness can not exist before Him. Every man more or less holy is bound
   to forsake all unholiness, to resign all lesser holiness, and let
   perfect holiness dwell and be manifest in him instantly. The
   commandment, "Be ye holy as I am holy," (Lev. xi. 45; 1 Pet. i. 16) may
   not be weakened. The laxity of the current morale requires that God's
   absolute right to demand absolute holiness of every man be incessantly
   presented to the conscience, bound as a memorial upon the heart, and
   proclaimed to all with no uncertain sound.

   In the innumerable territories of heaven where God gathers His
   redeemed, all unholiness is excluded and absolute holiness is the
   never-failing characteristic. And as it is in heaven, so it ought to be
   on earth. God, the sovereign Ruler of all the kingdoms of this world,
   has strictly forbidden the least unholiness in heart or home, or any
   other place on earth under the penalty of death. In fact, there is on
   earth no unholiness of whatever name or form, that does not exist in
   defiance of His express will.

   It must be conceded, therefore, that it is His revealed will and
   commandment that all this unholiness must cease immediately, and be
   replaced directly by what is holy and good. He is of purer eyes than to
   behold iniquity.

   It must be equally conceded that it is every man's duty to remove
   unholiness, and to advance the things that are holy. He that caused the
   hurt must also heal it. He that destroyed must also restore the things
   destroyed. He that desecrated the holy must also reconsecrate it. Men
   still alive to a sense of justice will not contradict us.

   The obligation to resanctify this world's life rests in its deepest
   sense upon Satan. He instilled into our veins the poison which
   generates the diseases of our souls. The spark that caused the fire of
   sinful passions to break out inhuman nature was kindled by him. That
   Satan is hopelessly lost and condemned, does not annul God's eternal
   right. Even Satan himself, according to this right, ought immediately
   to repent and stand before God holy as in the beginning. And this world
   of men, which he corrupted, was not his, but belonged to God. He should
   never have touched it. Hence the obligation continues to rest upon him
   not only to stop his unholy working in it, but also to reconsecrate
   perfectly what he has so bitterly and maliciously profaned.

   That Satan neither will nor can do this justifies his fearful judgment;
   but it does not annul God's right and never will. If in Paradise man
   had unwillingly fallen a victim to Satan, the obligation to resanctify
   the life of this world would have rested upon Satan, but not upon him.
   But man fell willingly; sin owes its existence not only to the
   fatherhood of Satan, but also to the motherhood of man's soul; hence
   man himself is involved in the guilt and included under the judgment of
   death, and therefore obliged to restore what he has ruined.

   God created man holy, with the power to continue holy; holy also by
   virtue of the increasing development of the implanted germ. But man
   ruined God's work in his heart. He soiled the undefiled raiment of
   holiness. And doing this he violated the right. If he had belonged to
   himself, if God had allowed him to do with himself as he pleased, the
   right would not have been violated. But He did not give man to himself;
   He retained him for Himself as His own property. The hand that ruined
   and desecrated man destroyed God's property, encroached upon the divine
   right of sovereignty--yea, upon His very right of ownership, and thus
   became liable (1) to the penalty for this encroachment, and (2) to the
   obligation of restoring the ruined property to its original state.

   Hence the undeniable and positive obligation of man's
   self-sanctification. This obligation rests, not upon God, nor upon
   Mediator, but upon man and Satan. The prayer, "Lord, sanctify me," upon
   the lips of the unconverted, not under the Covenant of Grace, is most
   unbecoming. First wilfully to destroy God's property, and then to take
   the ruined thing to Him demanding that He heal and restore it,
   antagonizes the right and reverses the ordinances. Nay, outside of the
   mysteries of the Covenant of Grace, under the obligations of simple
   justice, we are not to, ask: "Lord, sanctify Thou us," but God is to
   enforce His righteous claim: "Sanctify thyself."

   Sanctify thyself does not mean that man should fulfil the law. The
   keeping of the law and sanctification are two entirely different
   things. Let the sinner first be sanctified, and then he shall also
   fulfil the law. First sanctification, then fulfilment of the law.

   It is like a harp with broken strings. The harp was made to produce
   music by the harmonious vibration of the strings. But the production of
   music is not the mending of the harp. The broken strings must be
   replaced, the new strings must be tuned, and then is it possible to
   strike the melodious chords. The human heart is like that harp: God
   created it pure that we might keep the law; which an impure heart can
   not do. Hence being profaned and unholy, it must be sanctified; then it
   will be able to fulfil the law.

   For the sake of clearness, two acknowledged facts should be noticed:

   First, if man had never been profaned by sin, it would never have
   entered his mind to sanctify himself; and yet the law would have been
   fulfilled without disturbance. This shows that sanctification and
   fulfilment of the law are two entirely different things.

   Second, sanctification continues until a man dies and enters heaven.
   Then he is holy. Hence there is no sanctification in heaven. Yet the
   only occupation of the saints in heaven is the doing of that which is
   good. Hence sanctification is a matter by itself; it does not consist
   in the doing of good works, but must be an accomplished fact before a
   single good work can be done.

   Since man profaned himself, he is called of God to resanctify himself.
   Hence the claim of sanctification contains not even the shadow of a
   mystery. It has nothing to do with the mysteries, therefore is no
   dogma. It is the simplest and most natural verdict of God's right in
   the conscience. That we speak of unholiness implies that we are
   convinced that we ought to be holy.

   Is there contradiction, then, when we say, first, that sanctification
   itself is a mystery, and can be confessed only in the dogma; second
   that the demand of sanctification has nothing to do with the dogma?

   Not in the least. Sinners of whom God demands that they sanctify
   themselves are, individually and collectively, totally unable to
   satisfy that demand. To a certain extent they can withdraw from sin and
   worldliness, and often have done so. Many unconverted men have done
   many praiseworthy works. In many cases lives have been reformed, the
   whole tone of existence has been improved from mere impulse, without a
   trace of real conversion. And, conceiving sanctification to consist in
   the doing of less evil and of more good, and that from an improved
   motive, it was thought that unholy man, tho unable to satisfy this
   divine claim perfectly, might satisfy it to some extent. But all this
   has nothing in common with sanctification, and can be accomplished
   wholly without it. With all his self-betterment he can not effect the
   least part of it; tho told a thousand times to sanctify himself, he is
   both unwilling and unable.

   Hence the question: How, then, is sanctification to be accomplished?
   And since the question never received an answer from any of the sages,
   but only from God in His Word, therefore not the demand, but the means,
   of sanctification is for us incomprehensible and mysterious. Hence the
   character of sanctification must be emphasized as a mystery.

   And what is the reason for denying that sanctification is a mystery,
   i.e., the content of a dogma? The supposition that it is of human
   origin, that man is not totally unable, and that sanctification is
   betterment of character and life. Hence it is tantamount to (1) a
   lowering of holiness to the human standpoint; (2) an opposing
   sanctification as a work of God. And this is a very serious matter. We
   should again become clearly conscious of the fact that the holiness
   without which no man shall see God is not attained by the departing
   from some evil and the habitual doing of some good.

   The demand of sanctification belongs to the Covenant of Works;
   sanctification itself to the Covenant of Grace. This makes the
   difference very obvious. Not as tho the Covenant of Works commanded man
   to sanctify himself; given to holy men, it excluded sanctification. But
   God gave the Covenant of Grace to unholy men. And the only connection
   between the demand for sanctification and the Covenant of Works is,
   that the latter ever pursues fallen man with this demand, and with the
   terror of Horeb. Unholiness destroys the foundation of the Covenant of
   Works and renders compliance with its conditions impossible. Hence the
   absolute contradiction between it and the sinner's personal life. The
   one must make room for the other; they can not stand together.

   In this painful conflict we are often tempted to ask whether God is not
   unjust in His law to demand of us the impossible, and to lay the blame
   on Him; for did He not make us so? And from this difficulty the
   Arminian in our own heart seeks to escape, either by denying that there
   ever was a Covenant of Works; or by substituting the fulfilment of the
   law for sanctification.

   Wherefore it is our aim, especially regarding this doctrine, to escape
   from this harmful confusion of ideas, and to arrive at a correct
   understanding and purity of expression. The preaching must not add to
   the chaos, but lead us to clear insight and understanding.

   Instead of sweetly cradling ourselves upon the Word, we must earnestly
   endeavor to understand it. In city and country church the Word must be
   preached persistently, and with ever-increasing purity, until,
   convicted of personal unholiness, men begin to see that by absolute
   sanctification, not mere self-betterment; they must restore unto God
   His right; until, feeling their inability, with broken hearts they turn
   to God to receive the Mystery of Sanctification from the treasures of
   the Covenant of Grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III.

  Sanctification and Justification.

   "Yield your members servants to righteousness unto sanctification."
   --Rom. vi. 19.

   Sanctification must remain sanctification. It may not arbitrarily be
   robbed of its significance, nor be exchanged for something else. It
   must always signify the making holy of what is unholy or less holy.

   Care must be taken not to confound sanctification with justification; a
   common mistake, frequently made by thoughtless Scripture readers. Hence
   the importance of a thorough understanding of this difference. Being
   left unnoticed, it may lead to confused preaching, which causes
   one-sidedness; and active and thoughtful men, invariably systematize
   their one-sidedness.

   What, then, is the difference? According to our ancient theologians it
   is fourfold:

   1. Justification works for man; sanctification in man.

   2. Justification removes the guilt; sanctification the stain.

   3. Justification imputes to us an extraneous righteousness:
   sanctification works a righteousness inherent as our own.

   4. Justification is at once completed; sanctification increases
   gradually; hence remains imperfect.

   In the main the answer is correct, but insufficient to meet present
   error. It is shallow, external, and incomplete; makes too much of
   righteous-making and holy-making, while it does not consider
   righteousness and holiness, a correct idea of which is absolutely
   necessary for the clear understanding of justification and
   sanctification.

   Let us examine these fundamental ideas, first, in God Himself. It
   becomes evident at once that the words, "Our God is righteous," impress
   us otherwise than, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord!"

   The latter impresses us with the feeling that the, name of Jehovah is
   infinitely exalted above the low level of this impure and sinful life;
   we discover a distance between Him and ourselves which, as it widens in
   more transcendent holiness, casts us back into ourselves as impure
   creatures, while it causes His Being to be resplendent in the light
   unapproachable. If the angels exalting His holiness cover their faces
   with their wings, how much more ought we sinful men consider it with
   covered face and in godly fear! "The Lord is of purer eyes than to
   behold evil," impresses us with the deep sense of God's unspeakable
   sensitiveness, which is so keen that even the faintest suggestion of
   sin or impurity arouses in Him such antipathy that He can not bear the
   sight of it.

   But guilt is out of the question. In the presence of the divine
   holiness we do not feel guilty, but are overwhelmed by the
   consciousness of our utter uncleanness and wickedness. Even among men
   we do not always feel quite satisfied with ourselves. Our brother's
   warmer zeal and love often make us feel ashamed. Yet the feeling does
   not amount to loathing of self. But in the presence of the holiness of
   God we feel at once with Isaiah our spiritual impurity, and are
   inclined to cry for a live coal from the altar to sanctify our lips;
   and the word "loathing of self " is not too strong to express our
   feeling as we prostrate ourselves before the holiness of the Lord
   Jehovah.

   This establishes the antithesis at once. The divine holiness in its
   most exalted aspect affects us, not with fear of punishment, or with
   anguish, because we owe a debt that we can not pay; but with
   dissatisfaction with ourselves, with abhorrence of our uncleanness, and
   contempt for our righteousnesses which are as filthy rags. It makes us
   feel, not our guilt, but our sin; not our condemnation, but our
   hopeless wickedness; it does not crush us under the penalty of the law,
   but it causes us to be consumed by our impurity; it does not overwhelm
   us by righteousness, but it uncovers our unholiness and inward
   corruption.

   But the divine righteousness affects us altogether differently. It does
   not impress me with the transcendence of His exalted Covenant name as
   the divine holiness; but in God's hand it oppresses me, pursues me,
   leaves me no rest, seizes me, and breaks me to pieces under its weight.
   His holiness makes the soul thirst after holiness, and with sorrow we
   see His majesty depart. But His righteousness antagonizes the soul,
   which does not desire it, but struggles to escape from it.

   Sometimes it seems different, but only seemingly so. Godly men in the
   Old and New Covenants frequently invoke the divine righteousness.
   "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?'' (Gen. xviii. 25) This
   divine upholding of the right is the strength, the prospect, and the
   consolation of His oppressed people. This is why in the closing article
   of their Confession our fathers cry for the day of judgment, when as
   the righteous judge He shall destroy all His enemies and ours. Yet the
   difference is only seeming. In this case the divine right is directed
   against others, not ourselves; but the effect is the same. It is His
   people's prayer and hope that the divine right pursue those enemies and
   deal with them according to their deserts.

   Hence God's righteousness impresses us, first, with the fact of His
   authority over us; that not we, but He must determine what is right,
   and how we ought to be; that all our opposition is vain, for His power
   will enforce the right; hence that we must suffer the effects of that
   righteousness.

   But it is not merely the power of the right that impresses us, neither
   the consciousness that we are taken and judged, but much more, that we
   are taken and judged righteously. And not this arbitrarily; on the
   contrary, we feel inwardly that the divine might is right, and
   therefore may and must overpower us.

   Hence the divine righteousness includes the creature's acknowledgment:
   "The prerogative to determine the right is not mine, but His." And not
   only this, but our souls are deeply conscious that God's decisions are
   not only right and good, but absolutely righteous and superlatively
   good.

   The divine righteousness brings us face to face with a direct working
   of the divine sovereignty. All earthly sovereignty is but a feeble
   reflection of the divine; but sufficiently clear to show us its
   fundamental features. A sovereign is deemed sufficiently wise to see
   how things ought to be; and qualified to determine that so they shall
   be; and powerful to resist him who dares be otherwise. This applies
   also to the King of kings; or rather, it applies, not to Him also, but
   to Him alone. He alone is the Wisdom with absolute certainty to choose,
   and according to this choice to see how everything must be to be its
   best. He alone is the holy Qualified One, according to this to
   determine how everything must be. And He is the alone-Mighty to condemn
   and destroy what dares be otherwise.

   And this reveals the deepest features of the contrast. The holiness of
   God relates to His Being; the righteousness of God to His Sovereignty.
   Or, His righteousness touches His relation and position to the
   creature; His holiness points to His own inward Being.
     __________________________________________________________________

  IV.

  Sanctification and Justification (Continued).

   "He that is holy, let him be holy still." --Rev. xxii. 11.

   The divine Righteousness, having reference to the divine Sovereignty,
   in one sense does not manifest itself until God enters into
   relationship with the creatures. He was glorious in holiness from all
   eternity, for man's creation did not modify His Being; but His
   righteousness could not be displayed before creation, because right
   presupposes two beings sustaining the jural relation.

   An exile on an uninhabited island can not be righteous nor do
   righteously; he can not even conceive of the jural relation so long as
   there is no man present whose rights he must respect, or who can deny
   his rights. The arrival of other men will necessarily create the jural
   relation between him and them. But so long as he remains alone, he may
   be holy or unholy, but he can not be said to be righteous or
   unrighteous. In like manner it may be said of God that before creation
   He was holy, but could not display His righteousness simply because
   there were no creatures sustaining toward Him the jural relation. But
   immediately after the creation the display of righteousness became
   possible.

   Still the illustration can be applied to God only to a certain extent.
   Essentially God is not alone, but Triune in persons; hence there is
   between the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit a mutual relation.
   This relation, being the highest, tenderest, and most intimate,
   contains from eternity the completest expression of righteousness. And
   even with reference to the creature, the divine righteousness did not
   originate until after the creation, but finds perfect expression in the
   eternal counsel. That counsel not only determines every possible jural
   relation between the creatures and the Creator, and the creatures
   themselves, but indicates also the means whereby this relation must be
   restored when broken or disturbed.

   Hence His righteousness is as eternal as His Being; yet, in order to
   express clearly the difference between holiness and righteousness, we
   may say that as His holiness was glorious from eternity, so is His
   righteousness displayed and exercised only in time, i.e., since the
   creature began to exist. It did not originate then, but became
   perceptible then. Whatever may be said on the subject, the fundamental
   difference remains that God is holy even tho considered alone by
   Himself; while His righteousness begins to radiate when He is
   considered in relation to His creatures.

   God is holy essentially; before the least impurity existed, there was
   in Him vital pressure to repel all foreign mingling with His Being. But
   only as Sovereign could He determine the right, maintain the violated
   right, and execute righteousness upon the violater.

   In its fundamental features this applies to us as men. Even in us
   righteousness is entirely different from holiness; the former has
   exclusive reference to our relation to and position before God, man,
   and angel; while holiness refers, not to any relation, but to the
   quality of our inner being. We speak of righteousness only when it
   concerns our relation to God or man. Noah is said to have been a
   righteous man "in his generation," which indicates not his essential
   quality, but his relation to others.

   Righteousness implies right, which is unthinkable but as existing
   between two persons in connection with the qualification of either one
   or of a third to determine that right. Hence man's righteousness with
   reference to God has a twofold aspect:

   First, it implies the acknowledgment of God's sovereign qualifications
   to determine man's relation to God and man.

   Second, it implies reverence for the divine laws and ordinances enacted
   with regard to man's service of God.

   A man may keep strictly some of these ordinances, not from the motive
   of reverence, but because he is compelled to approve them. In some
   respects he gives God His due; but His position is wrong. He fails to
   honor God as his sovereign Ruler, to acknowledge God as God, and to bow
   before His majesty.

   Or he may reverence the divine authority in the abstract, but in
   practise constantly rob God of His right.

   Therefore original righteousness, which has reference to man's status
   before God as a creature, and derived righteousness, which refers to
   the act of honoring the divine ordinances, are two different things.
   Both are righteousness--i.e., the act of occupying the position
   divinely ordained. But the first refers to our personal standing in the
   position determined by God; the second to the act of conforming our
   thoughts, words, and deeds to His divine requirements.

   It is unnecessary to speak particularly of righteousness with reference
   to men. Whatever we do in relation to them is righteous or unrighteous
   according to its conformity or non-conformity to the divine ordinance,
   and every transgression against the neighbor becomes sin only because
   it is in non-conformity to the righteousness of God.

   Briefly, man's righteousness consists of two parts:

   First, that his status be what God has determined.

   Second, that his thoughts, words, and deeds be conformed to the divine
   ordinances. Hence our righteousness need not be the product of our own
   soul's labor. The original righteousness of Adam and Eve lacked
   nothing, altho they had not done anything to it personally. They simply
   stood in the right position before God a position not self-assumed, but
   divinely determined. And so may the right, after it is disturbed, be
   restored independently of the violator, by a third person. The question
   is not how the right relation was restored, but whether it agrees again
   with God's sovereign will.

   He that delivers a debtor from imprisonment by paying his debts
   restores him to his right relation to his former creditors, even tho
   the prisoner himself did not pay a farthing of the debt. Because
   righteousness has reference to mutual relations, the right is satisfied
   as soon as the disturbed relation is restored and the lost position
   recovered. How it was accomplished is immaterial.

   This gives us a deeper insight into the profound significance of the
   cross, and why it is that our righteousness can not be increased nor
   decreased, altho it does not affect our essential character.

   Entirely different is the soul's holiness, which touches directly the
   quality of person and character; as our ancient theologians correctly
   expressed it: "Justification acts for man; sanctification inheres in
   man."

   The ungodly is justified, i.e., the very moment that he believes;
   before sanctification has begun to operate in him, he knows that he
   stands before God perfectly right. He is not merely beginning to be
   right; partly right, to be a little more right tomorrow, and perfectly
   right when he enters heaven; but perfectly right now, henceforth, and
   forevermore. He is righted not only for the present and for all
   eternity, but also for the past. He is assured of standing before God
   in flawless right, as tho he had never been wrong, nor ever could be
   wrong again.

   Hence the consciousness of being justified is instantaneous and at once
   complete, and can not be increased nor decreased. And this is possible
   because this righteousness has nothing to do with his being, but has
   exclusive reference to the relation in which he sees himself placed.
   This relation was miserable and wholly unrighteous; but another,
   outside of himself, has restored that relation and made it what it
   ought to be. Hence he stands right, without any reference whatever to
   his personal being. This is the deep significance of the confession
   that he who is justified is always an ungodly person.

   But this is not the case in regard to man's holiness; that touches his
   person and can not be effected outside of his inward being.

  Holy Raiment of One's Own Weaving.

   "I dwell in the high and holy places." --Isa. lvii. 15.

   Holiness inheres in man's being.

   There is external holiness, e.g., that of the Levitical order, effected
   by washing or sprinkling with sacrificial blood; or official holiness,
   denoting separation for divine service, in which sense the prophets and
   apostles are called holy, and church-members are called holy and
   beloved. But these have nothing to do with the sanctification now under
   discussion.

   Sanctification as a gift of grace refers to a man's personal holiness.
   As the divine holiness is God's exaltation above, and angry recoil from
   all impurity and defilement, so is human holiness man's essential
   disposition by which spontaneously he loves purity and hates the
   unclean. Victory over temptation after a long and painful conflict, in
   which our feet had wellnigh slipped, is not holiness.

   Holiness signifies a disposition, an inherent quality, or, by another
   manner of speaking, a tint or shade adopted by the soul, so that the
   heart's evil manifestations and Satan's wicked whisperings fill us with
   positive horror. As the musically trained ear is painfully affected by
   a dissonance as it vibrates along the shuddering auditory nerve, while
   the unmusical ear never perceives the offense against the purity of
   tone, so is the difference between the sanctified and the unsanctified.
   Whatever the world's moral dissonances may be, they fail to affect the
   ungodly, who even praise the music; but they distress the saint whose
   soul delights in the harmony of holy concord.

   This holy or unholy disposition includes our entire inward being: it
   inheres in mind, conscience, understanding, will, feelings, and
   inclinations. Evil and impure speech affords pleasure or pain to all
   these.

   Yet this is not the final token of being holy or unholy. Something more
   is required. Do not many of the unregenerate shudder at much that is
   evil, and delight in mach that is good? Sympathy for the good may be
   called holiness only when it possesses this essential feature, that it
   wills the good for God's sake alone.

   God alone is holy. There is no holiness but that which descends from
   Him, the Fountain of all good, hence of all holiness. Mere human
   holiness is a counterfeit, an attack upon God's honor of being the sole
   and only Fountain of all good. It is the creature's effort to be equal
   with God, and as such essential sin. Nay, man's holiness must be the
   divinely implanted disposition, stirring his entire being to love what
   God loves, not from his own taste, but for His Name's sake.

   Being planned after the divine image, Adam and Eve possessed this
   holiness; hence discord between them and their Maker was impossible.
   Their holiness was not in germ merely, but complete, for everything in
   them was in perfect accord with God. And the redeemed in heaven are
   holy; in death they are severed completely from the internal source of
   sin; they are essentially in full and warm sympathy with the divine
   holiness, whose every feature, attracts them.

   But the sinner has lost this holiness. It is his misery that every
   expression of his being is naturally in collision with the will of God;
   whose holiness does not attract, but repels him. And mere regeneration
   does not sanctify his inclination and disposition; nor is it able of
   itself to germinate the holy disposition. But it requires the Holy
   Spirit's additional and very peculiar act, whereby the disposition of
   the regenerated and converted sinner is brought gradually into harmony
   with the divine will; and this is the gracious gift of sanctification.

   But this does not imply that a man who dies immediately after
   conversion enters heaven without sanctification. This would be a very
   comfortless doctrine, and would unintentionally encourage
   Antinomianism. God's child entering heaven is completely sanctified;
   not in this life, but after it.

   According to Scripture there is in heaven a difference between the
   spirits of the redeemed; they do not resemble each other as do two
   drops of water. In the parable of the talents Christ teaches clearly
   that in heaven there is a difference in the distribution of talents. He
   who denies this robs himself of the positive promise that "the Father
   who seeth in secret shall reward openly." (Matt. vi. 4, 6, 18) The
   heavenly state which we preach is not based upon the principles of the
   French Revolution; on the contrary, in the assembly of just men made
   perfect we shall never ascend to the rank of apostle or prophet,
   probably not even to that of martyr. Nevertheless there is in heaven no
   saint whose sanctification is incomplete. In this respect all are
   alike.

   But there will be room for development. The complete sanctification of
   my personality, body and soul, does not imply that my holy disposition
   is now in actual contact with all the fulness of the divine holiness.
   On the contrary, as I ascend from glory to glory, I shall find in the
   infinite depths of the divine Being the eternal object of richest
   delight in ever-increasing measure. In this respect the redeemed in
   heaven are like Adam and Eve in Paradise, who, tho perfectly holy, were
   destined to enter more fully into the life of the divine love by
   endless development.

   It should therefore be thoroughly understood that at the moment of
   their entering heaven the sanctification of the redeemed lacks nothing.
   Nevertheless their sanctification will receive fullest completion when,
   risen from the grave, in the glory of the resurrection-body, they enter
   the Kingdom of Glory after the day of judgment. Until that hour they
   are in a state of separation from the body, resting in peace; awaiting
   the coming of the Lord.

   Since sanctification includes body and soul, exhaustive treatment
   requires that we call attention to this point. Not as tho this
   intermediate state were sinful, a sort of purgatory; for the Scripture
   teaches clearly that in death we are separated from the body. The fact
   that the body remains impure until the day of glorification does not
   affect the holy state of the departed saint. Being freed from the body,
   he is no more affected by it. And when, in the notable day of the Lord,
   the body shall be restored to him; it shall be perfectly holy, pure,
   and glorified.

   That which belongs to Jesus enters heaven perfectly holy. The slightest
   lack would indicate something internally sinful; would annihilate the
   glorious confession that death is a dying to all sin, as well as the
   positive declaration of Scripture; that nothing that defiles shall
   enter the gates of the city. Hence it is the unalterable rule of
   sanctification that every redeemed soul entering heaven is perfectly
   sanctified.

   This applies to the infant who being regenerated in the cradle is
   carried thence to the grave, in whom, therefore, conscious exercise of
   holiness is out of the question; and to every converted person who dies
   suddenly; and to the man who, hardened all his life, in his dying hour
   repents before God, and departs one of the redeemed of the Lord.

   The supporters of the ordinary Arminian doctrine consider this
   representation impossible. They believe that sanctification is an
   effect of the saint's own exertion, exercise, and conflict. It is like
   a beautiful garment of fine linen, very desirable, but it must be of
   one's own weaving. This labor is begun immediately after the saint's
   conversion. The loom is set up, and he begins to weave. He continues
   his spiritual labor with but few interruptions. The piece of linen
   gradually increases under his hand, and assumes form and shape. If not
   cut down in early life, he expects to finish it even before the hour of
   his departure.

   The pulpit must oppose this theory, which comes, not from Arminius's
   books, but from man's wicked heart. For it is not only very
   comfortless, but also wicked.

   It is comfortless: for, if true, then all our precious little ones who
   died in the cradle are lost, for they could not put one stitch in this
   raiment of their glory; comfortless: for if the saint should happen to
   be behindhand with his weaving, or be taken away in the midst of his
   days before he could half finish it, he would surely be lost. Nor is it
   less comfortless for him whose death-bed conversion is utterly useless,
   for it came too late for the weaving of this garment of sanctification.

   And it is also wicked: for then Christ is no sufficient Savior. He may
   effect our justification and open the gates of Paradise, but the
   weaving of our own wedding-garments He lays upon us, without insuring
   us sufficient time to finish them. Yea, wicked indeed is it; for this
   makes the weaving of the fine linen our work, sanctification man's
   achievement, and God is no longer the only Author of our salvation.
   Then it is no grace, and man's own work is again on its feet.

   In thus subverting the very foundation of holy things; thoughtless
   Ethical theologians ought to consider the destruction they bring upon
   Christ's Church. Our fathers never believed this doctrine, and always
   opposed it. "There is no Gospel in it," they said. It is the concision
   of the Covenant of Grace; laying upon God's saints the fear and
   distress of the Covenant of Works.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VI.

  Christ Our Sanctification.

   "Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us...sanctification."--1 Cor. i.
   30.

   The redeemed soul possesses all things in Christ. He is a complete
   Savior. He lacks nothing. Having Him we are saved to the uttermost;
   without Him we are utterly lost and undone.

   We must earnestly maintain this point, especially with reference to
   sanctification; and repeat with increasing clearness that Christ is
   given us of God not only for wisdom and righteousness, but also for
   sanctification.

   It reads distinctly that Christ is our righteousness and
   sanctification. This translation is perfectly correct. The Greek does
   not read, "dikaiOsis," which is justification, but "dikaiosÃºne," which
   never refers to the act of making righteous, but to the condition of
   being righteous, therefore righteousness. So it does not read, "hÃ¡gios"
   or "hagiosÃºne," which might refer to holiness, but it reads distinctly,
   "hagiosmÃ³s," which points to the act of making holy.

   What the apostle distinguished so clearly should not be confounded.

   St. Paul and the Church of Corinth are believers. They are justified in
   Christ already, once for all; for Christ was made righteousness unto
   them. But this is not the case with sanctification. "Even the holiest
   men have only small beginnings of this obedience, which constrain them
   to live not only according to some, but according to all the
   commandments of God" (Heidelberg Catechism, q. 114). But the work is
   only just begun. Compared to former times, there is a holier love and
   spirit in them, but they are by no means wholly sanctified. They are
   under the treatment of the Spirit, their Sanctifier. They become more
   and more conformable to the image of God (q. 15). Hence there are
   degrees of progress in holiness. In those but recently converted,
   sanctification has progressed but little; in others it has made
   glorious progress. So there are in the Church holy, holier, and holiest
   persons (q. 114).

   Since the justification of the ungodly is at once finished, and the
   sanctification of the regenerate proceeds but slowly and gradually, St.
   Paul writes to the Corinthians with perfect precision that Christ is to
   him and them no more righteous-making, but righteousness; on the
   contrary, He had not yet become to them holiness, but only holy-making.

   This being well understood, it is impossible to be mistaken. If the
   apostle had intended to enumerate in the abstract all that a lost
   sinner possesses in Christ, he would have said: "Wise-making,
   righteous-making, and holy-making"; for a lost sinner walks still in
   his foolishness, is not yet made righteous, etc. But he describes his
   own experience, saying, that like a star the wisdom of God had arisen
   in his dark soul; that for Christ's sake he has obtained pardon and
   satisfaction, wherefore he stands perfectly righteous before God: and
   that now he is being made holy and being redeemed. He is not yet
   redeemed entirely; the Greek "apolutrosis" denotes also here a
   continued action of being made free from inward and outward misery.

   The Heidelberg Catechism (q. 60) describes the, righteous standing of
   the soul before God in the following striking manner:

     "Q. How art thou righteous before God?

     "A. Only by a true faith in Jesus Christ: so that, tho my conscience
     accuse me that I have grossly transgressed all the commands of God,
     and kept none of them, and am still inclined to all evil;
     notwithstanding, God, without any merit of mine, but only of mere
     grace, grants and imputes to me the perfect satisfaction,
     righteousness, and holiness of Christ; even so as if I never had
     had, nor committed any sin: yes, as if I had fully accomplished all
     that obedience which Christ hath accomplished for me; inasmuch as I
     embrace such benefit with a believing heart."

   The fact that this answer makes righteousness to include holiness has
   led less thoughtful men to infer that sanctification and justification
   are the same thing. Discussed at the Synod of Dort, this question was
   settled by inserting into article 22 of the Confession the following
   clause: "Jesus Christ imputing to us all His merits, and so many holy
   works, which He has done for us and in our stead, is our
   Righteousness."

   What does justification then include? Not the sanctification of our
   persons, but the sum-total of the holy works which we owe God according
   to the law. Question 60 calls this "our holiness."

   The difference between the two is clearly seen in Adam and Eve in
   Paradise. They were created personally holy; there was nothing unholy
   about them. But they had not yet fulfilled the law. They did not
   possess holy works. They had not acquired a treasure of holiness.
   Personally, one can be holy without having a single grain of
   accomplished or acquired holiness; and, on the other hand, one may have
   a perfectly fulfilled law without having the slightest function of
   personal holiness. Christ in the manger was perfectly holy, but He had
   not yet fulfilled the law, hence He had not an acquired holiness to
   present to us in our place. But in the hour of his justification the
   child of God receives (1) the complete remission of his punishment on
   the ground of Christ's atonement; (2) the complete remission of his
   indebtedness on the ground of Christ's satisfaction. And this
   satisfaction is but a perfect fulfilment of the law; a complete
   presentation of all good works; hence a perfect manifestation of
   holiness. Between questions 114 and 115 there is, therefore, not the
   slightest conflict.

   Sanctification and holiness are two different things. Holiness, in the
   60th question, has reference, not to personal dispositions and desires,
   but to the sum-total of all the holy works required by the law.
   Sanctification, on the contrary, refers not to any work of the law, but
   exclusively to the work of creating holy dispositions in the heart.

   If one asks, Is Christ your holiness as much as He is your
   righteousness and in the same sense? we answer: Yes, indeed, bless the
   Lord; He is my complete holiness before God, just as much as my perfect
   righteousness. The one is just as absolute and certain as the other.
   The performance of all the holy works required by the law of every man,
   according to the Covenant of Works, is a vicarious act of Christ in the
   fullest sense of the word. Wherefore we confess that the holy works
   which Christ has done for us are just as positively an imputed
   holiness, as we stand right before God by an imputed righteousness.
   Nothing can be added to it. It is whole, perfect, and complete in every
   respect.

   And that which is done for us in our stead is not again required of us.
   This would be morally absurd. According to the Covenant of Works,
   neither the law nor the lawgiver has anything more to demand of us. It
   is a finished work. The penalty is suffered, and the holiness required
   by the law is presented. We are perfectly righteous before God and our
   own consciousness, inasmuch as we receive this unspeakable benefit with
   a believing heart.

   But all that has nothing to do with our sanctification. In addition to
   the imputed righteousness and holy works, our sanctification comes next
   in order.

   From sin proceed guilt, penalty, and stain. From these three we must be
   delivered. From the penalty by Christ's atonement; from guilt by His
   satisfaction; and from the stain by sanctification. After God has
   redeemed us from the everlasting doom, we are still unholy, downtrodden
   in our unclean blood. Adam's inherent, holy disposition and desire are
   not yet restored to us. On the contrary, the stain of sin is there
   still. We delight in the law of God after the inward man, but we also
   find sin present always and everywhere in the sin-stain of body and
   soul. And God wills that this shall not continue. For the stain of sin
   He will substitute a holy disposition. He resolves to reform us
   inwardly, to renew us after the image of His dear Son, i.e., to
   sanctify us.

   It is only now that He begins to make us personally holy. As His
   children, we are dear to Him as the apple of His eye; He has engraven
   our names in the palms of His hands. We neglect things indifferent, but
   we polish the precious jewel. An old garment is cast aside, but we
   remove the stain from the costly silken gown. The housewife adorns the
   beloved homestead, and the gardener, pulls the weeds from his
   garden-beds. In like mariner, compelled by His love, God wills that His
   child, body and soul, be made bright until sin's stain be wholly
   removed.

   This is the work of sanctification, aiming exclusively at our personal
   sanctification, to restore unto us the holiness of Adam before he had
   performed any holy work.

   In Adam, personal holiness came first, then holiness consisting in the
   fulfilment of the law; but to God's child, the latter, imputed to him
   for Christ's sake, is imparted first, and his personal holiness
   follows. As Adam was created holy, so the regenerated is made holy.

   The personal sanctification of the regenerated and converted sinner
   begins after the quickening of faith; continues with more or less
   interruption all the days of his life; is finished, so far as the soul
   is concerned, in death, and, regarding the body, at the coming of the
   Lord. And since this is wrought by Christ, through the Holy Spirit, the
   Scripture confesses that Christ is not only our Righteousness, but also
   our Sanctification.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VII.

  Application of Sanctification.

   "Whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the
   image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren."
   --Rom. viii. 29.

   At His own time, and with irresistible grace, God translates His elect
   from death unto life. He gives them faith and the consciousness of
   being justified in Christ; and by conversion He puts their feet in the
   way of life. Thus they are free from guilt. There is for them no
   condemnation. Neither hell nor devil can prevail against them. Hence
   the apostle's shout of victory: "Who shall lay anything to the charge
   of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?
   It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again, who is even at
   the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us." (Rom.
   viii. 33, 34)

   God's child has formal proof of his justification not only in the Word,
   but also in Christ Himself, who continually presents His sacrifice
   before the Throne. Whether he has conscious enjoyment of this is
   immaterial. In his sleep, in fever's delirium, bereft of reason by
   physical causes, he continues God's child. Independent of sensations,
   experiences, and frames of mind; yea, tho he has never wept a tear of
   repentance, he possesses his treasure under all circumstances. Idiots
   even may possess it. Why should God have no children among them? Of
   course, under normal conditions conscious faith is the rule; but
   salvation does not depend upon the soul's actual experience. When you
   walk in the sun your shadow is visible; but your existence does not
   depend upon your shadow.

   It should be emphasized that sanctification does not imply human
   efforts and exertions to supplement Christ's work: but it is the
   additional grace of creating in the saint supernaturally a holy
   disposition.

   Sin imparts pollution, i.e., there can be no sin without begetting sin:
   Sin generates sin, imparts sin, is always the mother of sin. If this
   sin-begetting process were not stopped in our hearts, sin's chain would
   remain unbroken, link upon link, and only sin would be the result.

   But this is not the divine purpose. God wills that men should see our
   good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven. Therefore God has
   prepared good works that we should walk in them. But if the stain of
   sin were to work in us without any interruption, we could not walk in
   them. Not one of us could ever do a single good work. Light would never
   shine in the children of light, and there would be no occasion to
   glorify the Father in heaven. Good works wrought in us by the Holy
   Spirit independently of us can not offer such occasion. His works are
   always holy; there is nothing surprising in that. But when He causes
   holy works to proceed from us in such a way that they are truly our
   own, then there is occasion for praise--Matt. v. 16. Then men will ask
   in surprise, Who wrought this in them? and looking up will glorify the
   Father. And then the fearful continuity of sin called "stain" is
   broken; then the law that sin must beget sin, i.e., cultivate the
   sinful disposition, is replaced by another law which gradually
   introduces the holy disposition.

   This holy disposition can not spring from man, not even from
   regeneration. A starving child can not grow, neither can the child of
   God proceed to sanctification if left to himself. Altho sanctification
   is organically connected with the implanted life, yet it does not
   germinate without the constant showers of grace. Wherefore it is the
   free gift of the Father of Lights.

   The indwelling Spirit is the actual Worker. He performs it in all the
   saints, not partly, but wholly, both in life and in death, or in the
   hour of death alone. The latter applies to elect children, to idiots
   and insane persons, and to persons converted on their deathbed. In all
   others He performs it during their lifetime and in the hour of their
   departure.

   But there is a difference in different persons. In some the Holy Spirit
   begins sanctification in their childhood; in others at maturity. In
   some it proceeds almost without any interruption; in others it is
   hindered by conflict or apostasy. But in all He acts according to His
   pleasure. Sanctification is an artistic embroidery wrought in the soul,
   and He insures that it shall be finished at the moment appointed for
   our entrance into the New Jerusalem: but the manner and measure of
   progress depend solely upon His pleasure and purpose.

   First, sanctification is closely related to Christ, and is part of the
   Covenant grace which He insures to us as our Surety. It is not merely
   His work, but a grace inherent in His Person, and so identified with
   Him that the apostle exclaims: "Who of God is made unto us wisdom,
   righteousness, and sanctification?" It is related to the unio mystica:
   He vitally in us, and we vitally in Him; He the Vine, and we the
   branches: "It is not I that live, but Christ liveth in me"; (Gal. ii.
   20) He the Head, and we the members. All these indicate the vital union
   between the believer and the Mediator. The unborn child may be said to
   breathe through the mother's breath, and the mother to breathe in the
   child. The same is true here, altho the comparison illustrates, but
   does not exhaust the matter.

   Hence God's child can never be but in Christ. Not that he is always
   conscious of it. He often feels as tho Christ were far from him, and,
   deceived by this, he often strays so far that the bond of union seems
   to be utterly dissolved. This is really not so, for Christ never loses
   His hold; but to him it seems so. And this is the cause of the
   difficulty. In this condition his sinful nature alone is left him; all
   his treasure of grace is left with Jesus. For this reason the liturgy
   says: "Outside of Christ we lie in the midst of death." When with Dinah
   we leave the patriarchal tent to take the road to Shechem, we do so at
   our own risk and charges, having but Adam's inheritance, viz., a dead
   soul and a corrupt nature. Then to imagine that we have anything in
   ourselves acceptable to God is tantamount to a denial of Immanuel. With
   KÃ¶hlbrugge we say: "Considered outside of Christ, the converted and the
   unconverted are exactly alike."

   But, altho we forsake Him, He never forsakes us; there is between the
   converted in his deepest fall and the unconverted this immeasurable
   difference, that the soul of the former is inseparably bound to Jesus
   and the soul of the latter is not.

   Second, the sanctification of the saint is unthinkable without Christ,
   because the implanting of the holy disposition by the Divine Spirit is:
   "That we become more and more conformable to the image of God until we
   arrive at the perfection proposed to us in a life to come" (Heidelberg
   Catechism, q. 115). And is this not Christ's image?

   To be sanctified, then, means to have Christ obtain stature in us. It
   is not a few confused signs of holiness, but an organic whole of pure
   desire and inclination stamped upon the soul, embracing all the powers
   of the human spirit and disposition. Hence its progress can not be
   measured or numbered, ten degrees now and fifteen next year. It is the
   reflection of Christ's form upon the mirror-surface of the soul; first
   in dim outlines, gradually more distinct, until the experienced eye
   recognizes in it the form of Jesus. But even in the most advanced it is
   never more than a daguerreotype; Immanuel's perfect image will be
   revealed in us only in and through death.

   The holy disposition is a "perfect man," i.e., a form embracing the
   saint's whole personality; an expression of Christ's complete image,
   and therefore covering our entire human being.

   How foolish, then, to speak of sanctification as a result of human
   effort. When the person disappears, does not his shadow go with him?
   How, then, could Christ's image, form, or shadow remain in us when in
   our wanderings the soul is separated from Him? The brightness
   disappears with the light. A shadow can not be retained. This is why
   Immanuel is our sanctification in the fullest sense of the word. His
   form reflecting itself in the soul and the soul retaining that
   reflection is the whole work of sanctification.

   Finally, to the question, How can sanctification implant a holy
   disposition, if it depends upon the reflection of Jesus's form in the
   soul, since a denial or temporal apostasy separates us from Him? we
   answer: Can an inherent disposition not exist and continue without
   being exercised? One may have acquired the disposition (habit) of
   speaking fluent English, but not speak it for a whole year. So may the
   disposition or habit of holy desire cleave to the soul, even tho the
   stream of unholiness cover it for a season. And the soul is fully aware
   of this by the inward struggle of the conscience. If Jesus could lose
   His hold upon us, yea, then the holy disposition could not remain. But,
   since amid the deepest fall, the soul remains unconsciously in His
   hand, the objection has no weight.

  Sanctification in Fellowship with Immanuel

   "But now have ye your fruit unto sanctification, and the end
   everlasting life."--Rom. vi. 22.

   The third reason why our sanctification is in Christ is: that He has
   obtained it, that it flows from Him, and that He guarantees it.

   Having your mind thoroughly divested from the false idea that
   sanctification is your own embroidery, holding fast the clear doctrine
   that it is a gift of grace, this third reason will appeal to you. If
   sanctification is a gift, a favor, the question arises: What for? Is it
   a reward for the labor of your soul? Fruit of your prayer?
   Encouragement on the way? Is it on account of your loveliness, piety,
   goodness? Is it for anything in you? For there must be a motive. That
   God should bestow the precious and enduring gift of sanctification on
   persons who with both hands oppose it, and with rough fingers mar its
   beauty, is inconceivable. What was it, then, that moved the Lord God to
   favor you? You say: "His unfathomable pleasure, which is the deepest
   ground of all our salvation." Very well; but the divine counsel does
   not work as by magic. All that proceeds from that counsel runs its
   course, and shows its links that give it consistency.

   Hence the question must be asked: "Who is it that obtained for you the
   gracious gift of sanctification?" And the answer is: "Our Redeemer;
   sanctification is the fruit of the Cross."

   There is no division of labor in the redemptive work. Christ did not
   obtain on the cross our righteousness only; leaving it for us by
   conflict and self-denial to obtain our sanctification; but there is One
   who labors, the others enter into His rest; He has trodden the
   wine-press alone, and of the people there was none with Him.

   God has ordered our sanctification to flow from Christ directly. The
   Holy Spirit is the Worker, yet whatever He imparts to us He takes from
   Christ. "He shall receive of Mine; and He shall glorify Me." This is no
   empty phrase, but sober reality.

   What a redeemed soul needs is a human holiness. A man must be
   sanctified, not an angel. The latter can not be sanctified. Once
   fallen, he is lost forever. Created and fallen like Adam, he can not be
   restored like Adam. Knowing nothing of redemption, angels desire to
   look into it. Hence when, despite sin, God brings an innumerable
   company of men and angels to eternal life, He effects this by
   sanctifying the elect among unholy men; while the elect angels need no
   sanctification, for they have never become unholy. Sanctification
   refers, therefore, exclusively to men; imparts a holiness made possible
   and ordained only for men; creates a disposition bearing a human form
   and character, calculated for the peculiar needs of the human heart.

   The Holy Spirit finds this holy disposition in its required form, not
   in the Father, nor in Himself, but in Immanuel, who as the Son of God
   and the Son of man possesses holiness in that peculiar human form.

   Christ also guarantees to us this gracious gift. Justification being at
   once an accomplished fact does not require this, but sanctification is
   gradual.

   The lack of such guaranty would fill us with doubt and uncertainty
   concerning our own sanctification, seeing that its beginning is small
   and progress slow; and concerning that of deceased infants and persons
   converted late in life. Such doubts would cause us fear and rob us of
   the comfort of the finished work.

   Christ says: "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and
   I will give you rest" (Matt. xi. 28); yet experience teaches that to
   many believers the inherent unholiness causes constant unrest. They
   know that in Christ they are righteous, yet they are not comforted; for
   God says in His Word: "Be ye holy as I am holy." (1 Pet. i. 16) If it
   only read, "Act holily," Christ's merits might suffice; but it reads,
   "Be holy," and that means inherent, holy dispositions. Or if it read,
   "Become holy," their gradual approach to the ideal would inspire them
   with hope. But it reads inexorably, "Be holy," and that causes their
   wounded souls to fear.

   Not as tho every believer is troubled on this account. Alas! many
   scarcely ever, and the large majority never, give the matter any
   thought. So long as they have reconciliation and satisfaction,
   including finished good works, preached to them, they are at rest.
   Their fleshly nature is quite well satisfied with this. But there are
   others, more thoughtful and of tenderer conscience, who do not accept
   the "wide gate and the broad way" thus opened to their souls, but who
   believe the word: "Strait is the gate and narrow the way." (Matt. vii.
   14) To them it reads; "Be holy"; and there can be no rest or comfort
   for the conscience until they are reconciled with that word.

   Hence we say that it is not enough that Christ has obtained
   sanctification, that the Holy Spirit imparts it, but also that Christ
   guarantees it to us, not once, but, forever; so that whenever we appear
   before the Holy One we may be actually holy in Christ.

   And this is the blessed comfort of the Word, that Christ Himself is our
   sanctification. As in fallen Adam his descendants have the fearful
   certainty that their nature is wholly unclean, so in the risen Christ,
   His redeemed have the glorious guaranty that in Him they shall be
   completely holy.

   This is the mystery of the Vine and the branches, and of the profound
   word: "Now are ye clean through the word which I have spoken unto you."
   (John xv. 3) As our Surety He assures us hereby: (1) that the holy
   disposition once created in us, altho temporarily overwhelmed by sin,
   can never be lost; (2) that Christ's form, of which there is but a
   small beginning in us, shall attain full perfection before we enter the
   New Jerusalem; (3) that as our Surety He appears before the Father in
   our behalf, having deposited in the treasury of His merits all that we
   still lack, in our name. In this knowledge the troubled soul finds
   rest.

   Let us be careful that the precious vessel in which God presents to us
   this grace remains intact, for the sinner can suffice with nothing
   less.

   But we should also be careful to avoid the other extreme, which, under
   the plea that Christ is our sanctification, denies the work of the Holy
   Spirit in the soul. The supporters of this view concede that Christ is
   our sanctification, that the Holy Spirit works in us, and that good
   works are the result, but in such a way that our own person as such
   remains just as wicked and unprofitable as heretofore. To be regenerate
   or not, believing or unbelieving, is all the same. The only difference
   between the two is, that independently of our own person, and against
   our will, the Holy Spirit makes us walk unconsciously in the way of
   life.

   This pernicious teaching opposes Rom. vii. and the Confession of the
   Reformed churches. The apostle does not say that his desires and
   inclinations are still wicked, and that the Holy Spirit performs good
   works independently of him and yet by him; but he grieves that, while
   his desire is in sympathy with the divine will and wills the good, evil
   is still present. In similar sense the Catechism teaches that man is
   inclined to all evil so long as he is not born again, but no longer.
   For the quickening of the new man consists in a "sincere joy of heart
   in God, through Christ, and with love and delight to live according to
   the will of God" (q. 90).

   And the soul of the unconverted is not so disposed. Hence the
   difference between the two is so great that the gulf of heaven and hell
   yawns between them.

   It may therefore be profitable to our readers to lay before them once
   more the Confession of the Reformed theologians of the churches of
   Switzerland, Germany, England, and the Netherlands on this point
   (1619).

   They confessed: "That the Holy Spirit pervades the inmost recesses of
   the man; He opens the closed and softens the hardened heart, and
   circumcises that which was uncircumcised; infuses new qualities into
   the will, which, tho heretofore dead, He quickens; from being evil,
   disobedient, and refractory, He renders it good, obedient, and pliable;
   actuates and strengthens it, that, like a good tree, it may bring forth
   the fruits of good actions" (third section, fourth Head of Doctrine,
   art. 11).

   And this glorious work is, according to the unanimous Confession of the
   Reformed churches, performed in the following manner: "That the Lord
   does not take away the will and its properties, neither does violence
   thereto; but spiritually quickens, heals, corrects, and at the same
   time sweetly and powerfully bends it; that where carnal rebellion and
   resistance formerly prevailed, a ready and sincere spiritual obedience
   begins to reign; in which the true and spiritual restoration and
   freedom of our will consist" (third section, fourth Head of Doctrine,
   art. 16).

  IX.

  Implanted Dispositions.

   "Perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord."--2 Cor. vii. 1.

   To deny that the Holy Spirit creates new dispositions in the will is
   equivalent to a return to Romish error; even tho Rome argues the matter
   in a different way.

   Rome denies the total corruption of the will by sin; that its
   disposition is wholly evil. Hence, the will of the sinner not being
   wholly useless, it follows: (1) that the regenerate does not need the
   implanting of a new disposition; (2) that in this respect there is no
   difference between the regenerate and the unregenerate. They who
   introduce into the Reformed churches this and similar teachings ought
   to consider that they impair one of the foundations of the Reformation,
   and, however unintentionally, lead us back to Rome.

   The principal question in this controversy is: whether man is something
   or nothing.

   If man is absolutely nothing, as some fondly proclaim; then God can not
   work in him; for He can not work in nothing. In nothing one can make
   nothing. In nothing nothing can be implanted. To nothing nothing can
   cleave. Nothing can not be a channel for anything. If man is nothing,
   there can be neither sin nor justification, for the sin of nothing is
   nothing; and nothing is no sin. Nothing can not be born again, or be
   converted, or share the glory of the children of God. And if there is
   no sin, there is no need of a Savior to atone for sin; for to atone for
   nothing is no atonement. Then there is no need of discussing
   sanctification at all. This shows that the idea that man is nothing can
   not be taken in the absolute sense. Since man is a being, he must be
   something; and they who maintain that he is nothing show by their
   actions that they consider themselves far from nothing.

   But if we put it, "Man is nothing before God," it becomes at once
   intelligible. Then every good Christian subscribes to it
   unconditionally; he mourns only that it is so hard to become nothing
   before God; and with all the saints he prays that he may more sincerely
   deny himself, die to himself, and know himself as nothing before God.
   Measured by God, man has no value. All his endeavor to be something
   before God is ridiculous folly. Every pulpit ought to cast down, as
   with trumpet-tones, every mountain of pride, and humble man before God,
   so that, feeling himself a mere drop in the bucket--yea, less than
   nothing--he may find rest in the adoration of the divine Majesty.

   Before God man is not anything, not even the regenerate man; but in His
   hand, by His ordinance, and in His estimation, he is so great that "God
   crowns him with glory and honor," loves him as His child, makes him an
   heir of the heavenly bliss, and invites him to spend eternity with Him.

   These two may never be confounded; man's absolute nothingness before
   God may never be applied to man as an instrument in God's hand. And
   man's mighty significance as God's instrument may never tend to make
   him the merest something before God as a being.

   So we oppose pantheistic Mysticism and deadly Pelagianism..

   The essential mistake of the latter is, that it gives man as such a
   certain standing before God, and refuses to acknowledge that even the
   most learned and most excellent, whose breath is in his nostrils, "Yea,
   wherein is he to be esteemed?" is less than nothing before God. And
   false Mysticism is that injurious tendency of the human mind which, in
   all ages and among all nations, for the sake of being nothing before
   God, denies man's significance even as God's instrument. In its
   writings it is reiterated that before God man is nothing, that in God
   he disappears and loses himself, that God absorbs him. And this being
   absorbed is pushed so far that nothing remains to which sin or guilt
   can be ascribed. And thus the consciousness of responsibility and the
   conception of imputability were lost. Christian men, carried away by
   the fascination of being nothing, have sung hymns and preached sermons
   very acceptable to the Buddhists of India, but entirely outside of the
   pale of Christianity.

   Man as God's instrument is significant indeed. In creating him from
   nothing He created, not nothing, but something; and that something was
   so important that all creatures made before him pointed to him; in
   Paradise he alone was the bearer of the divine image. Dominion over all
   the earth was given to him; he is even to judge the angels. "The Son
   assumed the nature, not of angels, but of man."

   To say that this means that man is only a mirror reflecting the divine
   nature is the vain effort of this sickly mysticism to reconcile man's
   significance with its own pantheistic theories. The Scripture teaches,
   not that God reflects something in us, but that He imparts it to us.
   The love of God by the Holy Spirit is shed abroad in our hearts. The
   Lord makes us His temple and enters therein. A divine seed is placed in
   the soul. Pure water is sprinkled upon us. The Scripture uses many
   other images to warn us against the false theory that denies the
   inherent disposition in the soul and reduces man to a mere
   looking-glass. The branch is not a reflection of the vine, but grows
   from the trunk bearing leaf and cluster. A child is not a mere mirror
   of the father, but a being possessed of life and quality. An enemy is
   not one who merely fails to reflect correctly, but a being endowed with
   real existence.

   To make man, even as God's instrument, a mere mirror in principle
   denies sin, destroys the sense of responsibility, and changes actual
   life into the fancies of a dream.

   The Scripture teaches on this point that before God man is nothing;
   that only through God man is something; and that all inherent and
   acquired goodness comes only from the Fountain of all good. And,
   following in the steps of the Reformed fathers, we must maintain this
   doctrine. But to deny man's real and peculiar being is inconsistent
   with Scripture and with the Confession.

   Thus escaping from the chaos of a false mysticism, and returning to the
   purified and ordained truth, we find no more difficulty in
   sanctification. Of course, if God's child is but a polished mirror,
   then they who deny the inherent, holy disposition are right, and such
   disposition is out of the question. As a mirror, man is dead, and all
   that can be seen in him is but a faint and passing reflection of the
   image of God. But if man, as God's instrument, has being of his own
   kind, it is natural that besides being, God gave him also qualities. A
   being without qualities is unthinkable. There are qualities in every
   sphere: in the material world, for man eats, drinks, walks, and sleeps;
   in the intellectual world, for he thinks, judges, and decides; in
   matters of taste, for he judges things to be beautiful, ugly, or
   indifferent; and in the moral world, for his desires are righteous or
   unrighteous, noble or base, good or evil.

   And these qualities differ in different men. One loves food which
   another abhors. The judgment of one is blunt, and of another sharp. One
   calls handsome what another calls unsightly; good, what another deems
   evil. Hence there must be a difference in men's essential conditions,
   which may spring from their respective tempers, education, occupations,
   etc. Some men have these differences in common. Men of one group do not
   consider cursing sinful, but rather seem to enjoy it; those of another
   abhor it and protest against it. This proves that between these two
   there must be a difference of something; for without a different cause
   there can be no different effect. And this difference which causes some
   men to enjoy cursing and others to abhor it is called the disposition
   of a man's personality.

   It may be holy or unholy, but never indifferent. Being corrupt and
   unholy in unregenerate human nature, it can not be holy in the
   regenerate unless God create it in them. That which is born of the
   flesh is flesh. All our running and racing, toiling and slaving, can
   not create in us a holy disposition. God alone can do that. As He has
   the power by regeneration to change the root of life, so can He also by
   sanctification change the disposition of the affections. And He could
   have done this at once, just as in regeneration, by making our nature
   at once perfect in all its dispositions; but He that giveth no account
   of any of His matters has not been pleased to do so.

   Of course, He delivers His child at once from the bondage of sin; but
   as a rule the sanctification of his dispositions is gradual except in
   deceased infants elect, and men converted on their deathbed. In all
   others the implanting of holy dispositions goes step by step, sometimes
   even with temporal relapse. Without this increase in Christ there can
   be no sanctification; and the soul that falls short of sanctification,
   what ground has it to glory in its election?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Perfect in Parts, Imperfect in Degrees.

   And the very God of peace sanctify, you wholly; and I pray God your
   whole spirit and soul and body be
   preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- 1
   Thess. v. 23.

   The Scriptural doctrine that sanctification is a gradual process
   perfected only in death must be maintained clearly and soberly: first,
   in opposition to the Perfectionist, who says that saints may be "wholly
   sanctified" in this life; secondly, to those who deny the implanting of
   inherent holy dispositions in God's children.

   It should be noticed, therefore, that Sacred Scripture distinguishes
   sanctification, imperfect in degrees, and sanctification perfect in
   parts. A normal infant, tho small, is a perfect human being. Of course
   it must grow, but it has all the parts of the human body. The mental
   faculties can not be examined, but the bodily members are obviously
   perfect and complete. The head may not be covered with hair, various
   members may be still incomplete, but that does not impair its
   perfection: in a small beginning the constituent parts and members are
   all present. Hence the child is called perfect in parts.

   Yet it is not perfect in degrees, i.e., it has not attained its full
   growth. It must grow and increase in every respect. And this is a slow
   and imperceptible progress. A garment fitting perfectly at night is
   never too small in the morning. One night's growth is imperceptible.
   Yet we grow and increase; and until death's hour the body changes
   constantly. And this increase and the subsequent decrease of old age
   affect all the parts equally. It never happens that a child's arm
   grows, but not his leg, that his neck expands, while the head remains
   small. This gradual increase is the expanding force of an inherent
   vital principle, pervading all the members and every part.

   This applies to the children of God in the second birth even more
   forcibly, for in the divine kingdom are no deformities; all proceed
   from the hand of their Creator a perfect creation. This perfection is
   in the parts, i.e., they have what essentially belongs to them. And
   every member is internally animated and wrought upon from one vital
   principle, by the Holy Spirit, in such a way that all the parts are
   affected by it spontaneously. Hence in sanctification holy desires and
   inclinations must spring from that internal, vital principle in the
   parts and pervade every member.

   In this sense sanctification is a perfect work; not externally, but on
   God's part, in that He causes the sanctifying principle to affect every
   member. He does not first sanctify the will, then the understanding, or
   first the soul and then the body; but His work embraces the entire new
   man at once.

   But sanctification is imperfect in the degree of its development. When
   for ten years God has wrought in us, the holy desire must be much
   stronger than in the beginning. This is the result of growth, of
   gradual increase, despite many ups and downs, almost imperceptible.
   Hence there are steps, ascending from less to more with reference to
   the new man; and descending from more to less in the dying of the old;
   but in both a gradual change, ever farther from Satan and nearer to
   God.

   "Perfect in parts, imperfect in degrees," as our godly fathers used to
   say, by which they illustrated the second birth by comparing it with
   the first; and in this they simply followed Scripture; which places the
   perfection of God's gift alongside the imperfection of our gradual
   increase. The Catechism expresses it as follows: "Even the holiest men,
   while in this life, have only small beginnings of this obedience; yet
   so that with a sincere resolution they begin to live not only according
   to some, but to all, the commandments of God" (q. 114). St. Paul says
   that "Christ has given some pastors and some teachers, for the
   perfecting of saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
   the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the faith and of
   the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
   of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Ephes. iv. 12). In 2 Cor. x.
   15 he hopes to be enlarged among them when their faith shall be
   increased. To the Colossians he writes: "That ye might walk worthy of
   the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and
   increasing in the knowledge of God" (Col. i. 10). To the Thessalonians:
   "Your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you
   all toward each other aboundeth" (2 Thess. i. 3). The psalmist sings
   that "the righteous shall flourish as a palm-tree"; and St. Paul says
   to Timothy, his son in Christ: "Give thyself wholly to these things,
   that thy perfecting may appear to all" (1 Tim. iv. 15). From his own
   experience the apostle testifies: "Not as tho I had already attained,
   but I follow after if that I may apprehend." And writing to the
   Corinthians, he draws a picture of the fruit of sanctification, saying:
   "But we all are changed unto the same image from glory to glory, even
   as by the Spirit of the Lord."

   But we should not fall in the common error of applying to
   sanctification what Scripture teaches concerning the "Children" and the
   "perfect." This causes confusion. Speaking of different classes of
   believers, Scripture recognizes the fact that there are different
   degrees. This appears most clearly from St. John's first epistle (ii.
   12-14), where he addresses believers as "young men" and as "fathers,"
   evidently with reference to their age, for he places the latter as more
   mature in spiritual experience above the former. In Heb. v. 13, 14, St.
   Paul distinguishes the "perfect" who use strong meat, and the "babes"
   who depend upon milk. To the Corinthians: "Brethren, I could not speak
   unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal," i.e., to those who can
   not bear meat, but who must still be fed with milk (1 Cor. iii. 11ff:).
   That these words relate to sanctification is evident from what follows:
   "For ye are yet carnal, whereas there is among you envying and strife
   (ver. 3). Of himself he testifies: "When I was a child I understood as
   a child; but when I became a man I put away childish things" (1 Cor.
   xiii. 11). He exhorts the Ephesians (iv. 14): "Be no more children
   tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine"; and among the
   Philippians he distinguishes the perfect and the not perfect, saying:
   "Let us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded" (iii. 15).

   Hence the apostle evidently distinguished two classes of believers:
   those whose condition is normal, and those who are still in a
   preliminary condition. Scripture designates the former as "perfect,"
   "adults," "men and fathers" to whom belongs the strong meat; the latter
   as "babes," "young men" who still use the milk.

   Now the question arises whether the transition from the former unto the
   latter is the same as the gradual increase of sanctification. Generally
   the answer is affirmative; but Scripture answers it negatively, for
   reasons as clear as daylight. Convincing proof we find in Phil. iii.
   12-15. In verse 12 St. Paul says, "I am not yet perfect"; and directly
   after that (ver. 15), and in the same connection, he puts himself just
   as distinctly among the perfect; yea, he offers himself even as their
   example.

   It is evident that when St. Paul, under the direct leading of the Holy
   Spirit, declares in the same moment that he is not yet perfect, and
   that he is perfect, yea, the example of the perfect, the word "perfect"
   may not be taken in the same sense in both cases; in the one it must
   have a different meaning from that in the other.

   They who believe in gradual sanctification should not appeal to this
   and similar passages to support their doctrine. Such misapplication of
   Scripture is grist for the mill of the Perfectionists, who with good
   reason reply: "The apostles were evidently acquainted with saints
   'wholly sanctified' like ourselves."

   And what is the difference?

   A child and a man are not the same; the latter is physically full
   grown, the former is not. The latter having attained manhood enters
   upon the new process of becoming nobler, more refined, inwardly
   stronger. The oak continues to grow until it has attained its full
   height, which process covers many years. But this is not the end of its
   development. On the contrary, it does not begin to acquire its iron
   qualities until it is full grown. The child is sent to school for the
   exercise of its powers. Having passed through successive institutions,
   and being graduated from the highest, he receives his diploma which
   declares that his education is finished and that he is ready to enter
   upon his life's career; i.e., his education is finished so far as the
   school is concerned. But this does not imply that he has nothing more
   to learn. On the contrary, only now are his eyes opened to see the
   reality and actual condition of things. His education is finished, and
   yet he only begins to learn.

   And the same applies to those whom Scripture calls "perfect." A new
   convert should first go to school, and not, after the practise of
   Methodism, [36] be directly put to work to convert others as a perfect
   believer. He is only a babe, says the apostle, a partaker of milk; and
   a babe can not be expected to assist as midwife or nurse in the
   spiritual birth of other babes.

   It is the great mistake of many Sunday-schools to make sucking lambs do
   the work of ewes; of neglecting to feed the new-born babes with
   spiritual knowledge and discipline. And the insane notion, which is
   gaining ground more and more, that a young man who has evinced but a
   slight stir of spiritual life must be promoted at once to the state of
   the mature Christian, brings destruction upon the Church. This is why
   so few inquire after the truth, or seek to enrich themselves with
   spiritual knowledge; why the spiritual life seems to consist only of
   running and racing until, spiritually exhausted and impoverished, men
   sit down bitterly disappointed. This makes unhealthy Christians,
   spiritually consumptive, tall and thin, with glittering eye and hectic
   cheek, but without manly, strength and vigorous pulse. Of course, such
   can not resist the whirlwind of strange teachings without being carried
   about with every wind of doctrine.

   Wherefore we repeat that a new-born babe must first be fed with milk;
   then be sent to school, not to teach, but to learn. And the ministers
   of the Word in the pulpit, parents at home, and teachers in our
   Christian schools should examine themselves whether they understand the
   art of feeding the babes with milk, whether in the teaching the bread
   is not too heavy, whether they have not forgotten that there are
   sucking lambs in the flock.

   Of course, the time will come when the suckling will be able to digest
   solid food. Knowledge will accumulate, and by and by his education be
   finished. And then it would be exceedingly foolish not to go on to
   perfection, but to withhold solid food, and to continue to feed all the
   members of the church alike on milk. Such a course would soon empty the
   church. Men provided with spiritual teeth can not live on such diet.
   The preaching which is always laying the first foundations kills both
   preacher and people.

   Hence there is a time in the life of the saint when this first process
   of growth is finished; when believers, having become men, take their
   place among the mature and perfect. And in this sense we hear the
   apostle say: "I do not belong to the babes in their mother's lap, nor
   to the children at school, but to the adults and the perfect whose
   education is finished. But, O brethren, do not think that I am perfect
   inwardly, for I have not yet attained; but I follow after, if that I
   may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus."

   We see the same difference in plant and animal, in the natural and
   spiritual birth. There is first a growth to attain the full stature,
   then only the real development begins which in the children of God is
   the unfolding of the holy disposition in their own person.

  XI.

  The Pietist and the Perfectionist.

   "He chastens us for our profit, that we might be partakers of His
   holiness."--Heb. xii. 10.

   Sanctification is a gracious work of God, whereby in a supernatural way
   He gradually divests from sin the inclinations and dispositions of the
   regenerate and clothes them with holiness.

   Here we meet a serious objection which deserves our careful attention.
   To the superficial observer, the spiritual experience of God's children
   seems diametrically opposed to this professed gift of sanctification.
   One says: "Can it be that for more than ten years I have been the
   subject of a divine operation whereby my desires and inclinations were
   divested of sin and clothed with holiness? If this is the Gospel, then
   I belong not to the Lord's redeemed; for in myself I perceive scarcely
   any progress; I only know that my first love has become cold and that
   the inward corruption is appalling. Some dream of progress, but I
   discover in myself scarcely anything but backsliding. No gain but loss,
   is the sad footing-up of the account. My only hope is Immanuel my
   Surety."

   While the experience of a broken heart vents its grief in this way,
   others exhort us not to encourage spiritual pride. They say: "We should
   not foster spiritual pride in God's children, for by nature they are
   already thus inclined. What is more conducive to spiritual pride than
   the conceit of an ever-advancing holiness? Is not holiness the highest
   and most glorious attainment? Is it not our comprehensive prayer to be
   made partakers of His holiness? And would you have these souls imagine
   that, since they were converted a number of years ago, they have
   attained already a considerable degree of this divine perfection? Would
   you give license to older Christians to feel themselves above their
   younger brethren? Holiness wants to be noticed; hence you incite them
   to a display of their good works. What is this but to cultivate a
   spirit of Pharisaism?

   We may not rest until this objection of the sensitive conscience is
   entirely removed.

   Not as tho we could escape all dangers of Pharisaism. This would
   silence every exhortation to holy living. Light without shadows is
   impossible; the shadows disappear only in absolute darkness. In the
   days of the ancient Pharisee, Jerusalem, compared with Rome and Athens,
   was a God-fearing city. Pharisaism was never more bold than in the days
   of Jesus. And history shows that the danger of Pharisaism has always
   been least in the Romish and greatest in the Reformed churches; and
   among the latter, it is strongest where the name of God is most
   exalted. Godliness is impossible without the shadow of Pharisaism. The
   brighter the light and glory of the former, the darker the shadow of
   the latter. To escape Pharisaism altogether one must descend into the
   lowest pest-holes of society, where nothing bridles the passions of
   men.

   And this is natural. Pharisaism is not a common corruption, but the
   mildew of the noblest fruit the earth ever saw--viz., godliness. The
   circles that are free from Pharisaism also lack the highest good; how,
   then, could it decay there? And the circles in which this danger is
   greatest are the very circles in which the highest good is known and
   exalted.

   But, apart from this aimless skirmishing with the Pharisaic phantom,
   the scruple mentioned above has our heartiest sympathy. If it were true
   that sanctification so impressed the soul as to incite it to pride, it
   could not be the real article; for of all unholiness pride is the most
   abominable. It is David's sweet and sincere supplication: "Keep back
   thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion
   over me; then shall I be upright and shall be innocent from the great
   transgressions." (Psalm xix. 13) The fundamental conception of grace is
   so intimately connected with the idea of becoming a little child, and
   its gift is so strongly conditioned upon a humble disposition, that the
   gift which encourages spiritual pride can not be a gift of grace.

   But we are confident that the doctrine of sanctification, as presented
   in these pages according to the Holy Scripture, has nothing in common
   with this caricature. Since in Paradise sin sprang from the first
   satanic incitement to pride, and all spiritual and carnal unholiness
   still grows from that poisonous root, it is evident that the first
   effect of the implanted, holy disposition must be the humbling of this
   pride, the pulling down of this stronghold; and at the same time the
   quickening of a humble, meek, and childlike spirit.

   The idea that sanctification consists in inspiring the saint with
   horror for gross and outward sins, without a previous breaking down of
   self-conceit, is unscriptural and opposed by the Reformed churches. The
   Scripture teaches that the Holy Spirit never applies sanctification to
   the believer without attacking all his sins at once. "A sincere
   resolution to live not only according to some, but to all the
   commandments of God" (Heidelberg Catechism).

   Of all sins pride is the most accursed, for in all its manifestations
   it is the transgression of the first commandment. Hence real and
   divinely wrought sanctification is inconceivable without, first of all,
   destroying pride, and creating a humble, quiet, self-distrusting, and
   childlike disposition.

   And this solves the whole difficulty. He who fears that gradual
   sanctification will lead to pride and self-conceit confounds its human
   counterfeit with the real work divinely wrought. Wherefore, with this
   objection, he must attack the hypocrite, and not us.

   However, a wrong interpretation of what the Scripture calls "flesh"
   might suggest it. If "flesh" signifies sensual inclinations and bodily
   appetites, and sanctification consisted almost entirely in warring
   against these sins, sanctification thus understood might be accompanied
   by an increase of spiritual pride. But by sinful "flesh" the Scripture
   denotes the entire man, body and soul, including sins which are
   spiritual as well as sensual; hence sanctification aims at once at the
   change of man's spiritual and sensual inclinations, and first of all at
   his tendency to pride.

   In the preceding article we said that sanctification included a descent
   as well as an ascent. When the Lord raises us, we also descend. There
   is no rising of the new man without a death of the old; and every
   attempt to teach sanctification without doing full justice to both is
   unscriptural.

   We oppose, therefore, the attempts of the Pietist and of the
   Perfectionist, who say that they have nothing more to do with the old
   man, that nothing remains in them to be mortified, and that all that is
   required of them is to hurry the growth of the new man. And we equally
   oppose the opposite; which admits the dying of the old man, but denies
   the rising of the new, and that the soul receives all that it lacks.

   Every true and lasting conversion, according to our Catechism, must
   manifest itself in these two parts, viz., a mortification of the old
   man, and a rising of the new, in equal proportions.

   And in answer to the question, "What is the mortification of the old
   man?" the Heidelberg Catechism answers, "A gradual decrease," for it
   says: "It is a sincere sorrow of heart that we have provoked God by our
   sins; and more and more to hate and flee from them." While the
   quickening of the new man is expressed just as positively: "It is a
   sincere joy of heart in God through Christ, and with love and delight
   to live according to the will of God in all good works"--a declaration
   that is repeated in the answer of the 115th question, which thus
   describes this mortification: "That all our lifetime we may learn more
   and more to know our sinful nature"; and which speaks of the quickening
   of the new man as "becoming more and more conformable to the image of
   God."

   Hence there are two parts, or rather two aspects of the same thing: (1)
   the breaking down of the old man; (2) a growing conformity to the
   divine image.

   To mortify and to quicken, to kill and to make alive, more and
   more--this is, according to the Confession of the fathers, the work of
   the Triune God in sanctification.

   Sin is not merely the "lack of righteousness." As soon as
   righteousness, goodness, and wisdom disappear, unrighteousness, evil,
   and folly take their place. As God implanted in man the first three
   named, so does sin not merely rob him of them, but it puts the last
   three in their place. Sin did not only kill in Adam the man of God, but
   also quickened in him the man of sin; hence sanctification must effect
   in us the very opposite. It must mortify that which sin has quickened,
   and quicken that which sin has mortified.

   If this rule is thoroughly understood, there can be no confusion. Our
   idea of sanctification necessarily corresponds to our idea of sin. They
   who consider sin as a mere poison, and deny the loss of original
   righteousness, are Pietists; they ignore the mortification of the old
   man, and always busy themselves adorning the new. And they who say that
   sin is the loss of original righteousness, and deny its positive, evil
   effects, are inclined to Antinomianism, and reduce sanctification to a
   fancied emancipation from the old man, rejecting the rising of the new.

   Of course, this touches the doctrine of the old man and the new.

   The representation that the soul of the converted is an arena where the
   two are engaged in a hand-to-hand fight is incorrect, and has not a
   single satisfactory text for its support. We reject the two following
   representations: that of the Antinomian, who says: "The believing ego
   is the new man in Christ Jesus; I am not responsible for the old man,
   the personal, sinful ego; he may sin as much as he please"; and the
   representation of the Pietist, who considers him still the old man,
   partly renewed, and who is always busy to remodel him. These two do not
   belong to Christ's Church.

   The Scripture teaches, not that the old man is sanctified by being
   changed into the new; but that the old man must be mortified until
   nothing of him remains. Neither does it teach that in regeneration a
   small part only of the old man is renewed--the remainder to be patched
   up gradually--but that an entirely new man is implanted.

   This is of greatest importance for the right understanding of these
   holy things. Sin wrought in us an old man, the body of sin: not merely
   a part, but the whole, with all that belongs to him, body and soul.
   Hence that old man must die, and the Pietist with all his works of
   piety can never galvanize a single muscle in his body. He is altogether
   unprofitable, and must perish under his just condemnation.

   In like manner God graciously regenerates in us a new creature, which
   is also a complete man. Therefore we may not take the new man as the
   gradual restoration of the old. The two have nothing in common but the
   mutual basis of the same personality. The new does not spring from the
   old, but supersedes him. Being only in the germ, he may be buried in
   the newly regenerate, but he will arise and then God's work appears
   gloriously. God is his Author, Creator, and Father. Not the old man,
   but the new man cries out: "Abba, Father!"

   However, our ego is related to the dying old man and the rising new
   man. The ego of a non-elect person is identified with the old man; they
   are the same. But in the consummation of the heavenly glory, the ego of
   God's children is identified with the new man.

   But during the days of our earthly life this is not so. The new man of
   an unregenerate, but elect person exists apart from him, but hid in
   Christ. He is still wedded to his old man. But in regeneration and
   conversion God dissolves this unholy marriage, and He unites his ego to
   the new man. Yet, despite all this, he is not yet rid of the old man.
   Before God and the law, from the viewpoint of eternity, he may be so
   considered, but not actually and really.

   And this is the cause of the conflict within and without. All evil ties
   are not dissolved at once, and all holy ties are not united at once. By
   the mystic union with Christ the child of God actually possesses the
   entire new man, even tho he should die to-morrow; but he has not yet
   the enjoyment of it. Being weaned to the new man before God, he is, by
   a painful process, yet to die to the old man, and by divine grace the
   new man is to be raised in him. And this is his sanctification: the
   dying of the old and the rising of the new, by which God increases and
   we decrease. Blessed manifestation of faith!

  XII.

  The Old Man and the New.

   "That we being dead unto sin should
   live unto righteousness."--1 Peter iv. 24.

   The Psalmist sings: "They go from strength to strength, every one of
   them in Zion appeareth before God." (Psalm lxxxiv. 7) We must maintain
   this glorious testimony, altho our own experience often seems to
   contradict it. Not experience, but the Scripture, teaches us divine
   truth; nor is it as tho the procedure of the divine operation in our
   own heart could differ from the testimony of the Sacred Scripture, but
   that our experience often interprets our real spiritual condition
   incorrectly.

   Our knowledge of self is very small. The plummet of our
   self-consciousness scarcely reaches below the surface, while God's holy
   eye penetrates the waters of the soul to the very bottom. We are
   ignorant of much that takes place in the soul, and what we perceive of
   it often presents itself to our consciousness as different from what it
   is in reality. If our self-knowledge were perfect, the testimony of our
   spiritual experience would be as reliable as that of the Scripture. But
   this not being so, not even among God's children, spiritual experience,
   tho helpful, may never weaken the Word of God. Hence, tho we discover
   in ourselves an ever-growing weakness, the Scripture testimony is still
   sure: "They go from strength to strength."

   But who goes from strength to strength? Surely not the old man. It may
   not be said that regeneration effected a change in him which is
   constantly increasing, which enables him to make such commendable
   progress that by divine help he will probably succeed in the end. This
   is not so. Scripture teaches that the old man is dead, condemned to die
   forever; that he is incorrigible and can not be restored, saved, or
   reconciled. He is hopelessly lost. And instead of gradually becoming
   himself again he must be crucified, slain, and buried. Instead of
   expecting anything good of him, it should be our glory to die to him
   and be rid of him.

   Neither does the new man go from strength to strength. He is not being
   put together little by little until he can stand on his own legs; but,
   since we are to live forever in the new creature, it must be a real man
   born in us. And as such he can not increase nor decrease; he only
   slumbers in the germ and must arise.

   But my person, as by faith I stand in Christ, must go from strength to
   strength. That person was once born in the old man, and therefore was
   born in trespasses and sin, and is a child of wrath by nature. And he
   would never have come out and escaped from the old man of himself. That
   he could not do. He was identified with the old man so completely that
   the latter was his very ego. He had no other life or existence. But in
   regeneration a change took place. By this divine act our person is in
   principle detached from his former ego in the old man. The root was
   notched and, by the constant action of storm and gravitation, the
   severed parts separated more and more. Our person is no longer
   identified with the old man, but opposes him. Even tho he succeeds in
   enticing us again to sin, even in the yielding we do not what we will,
   but what we hate. Only hear what St. Paul says: "The good which I would
   I do not, but the evil which I would not that I do. Now, if I do that I
   would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
   (Rom vii. 19, 20)

   Wherefore the child of God must not be identified with the old man
   after regeneration, for this opposes the plain teaching of the Word. He
   is the old man no more, but wars against him. As God's child he is
   become the new man--not in part, but wholly. "Old things are passed
   away, behold all things are become new." [37] In this, and nothing
   less, is cause of his glorying. His person is passed from death into
   life. He is translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
   God's dear Son. He is so fully identified with the new man that, while
   still living in this world, he is already set with Christ in heaven,
   where his citizenship is, and where his life is hid with Christ in God.

   If the word of the Psalmist does not refer to the old man nor to the
   new, to whom, then, does it refer? The Scripture answers: to believers,
   their person, their ego, which, being detached from the old man and
   opposing him, is identified with the new. They go from strength to
   strength. It is true the use of "ego" in both senses is apt to confuse
   one; yet St. Paul does the same thing. He says "I" and "not I ": "I
   live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." (Gal. ii. 20) The same
   person who fell in Adam and out of Adam received the old man with whom
   for a time he was identified, is now changed, translated, and risen
   with Christ; out of Christ he received a new man, and with that new man
   he is being more and more identified. Hence he goes from strength to
   strength.

   This identification of our person with the new man is, immediately
   after regeneration, still very slight; while we are so thoroughly bound
   to the old man, with almost all the fibers of our being, that it seems
   as tho he were still our very self. But by the operation of the Holy
   Spirit we gradually die to the old man, and at the same time the new
   man is quickened in us more and more. And, since both the dying of the
   old and the gradual rising of the new man are profitable to our person,
   the Holy Spirit testifies concerning His own work that we, God's
   children, go from strength to strength until every one of us in Zion
   appeareth before God. It refers not only to our growing into the new
   man, but just as much to our gradual deliverance from the dying old
   man. In both it is the same working; hence both afford us increase of
   strength.

   We consider first the dying of the old man as far as it relates to
   sanctification.

   This dying has no reference to our own activity, alluded to by the
   office of baptism, "That we manfully fight and overcome sin and the
   devil and all his dominion"; on the contrary, it refers to the fruit of
   the cross of Christ. The question, "What further benefit do we receive
   from the sacrifice and death of Christ on the cross?" the Reformed
   Church answers: "That by virtue thereof our old man is crucified, and
   buried with Him; that so the corrupt inclinations of the flesh may no
   more reign in us" (Heidelberg Catechism, q. 43). Hence the dying of the
   old man is not the fruit of our labor; but Christ accomplishes it in us
   by virtue of His cross through the Holy Spirit.

   In order to effect this in us the Holy Spirit diverts our personal
   affections, inclinations, and dispositions from the old man, to whom
   hitherto they have been ardently attached, so that now we begin to hate
   him.

   It is possible for friendship to die. We may have been intimate with a
   person whom we afterward discovered to be a bad character. Then not
   only is the friendship broken, but our affection ceases. We regret our
   former intimacy, and we despise him all the more cordially as he proves
   to be more deceitful and malicious. And this applies to our relation
   with the old man. Formerly we were most intimate with him. We shared
   his will, his sympathies, and his affections. We lived one life with
   him. We felt ourselves bound to him by the tenderest ties. We could not
   be happy but in his company. But there came a change. We acquired a
   different taste. We became acquainted with another and better
   man--viz., the new man in Christ Jesus--and we became very intimate
   with him. And this noble intercourse discovered to us the thorough
   baseness and corruption of the old man. Then our love ceased and we
   began cordially to hate him.

   It is true that our former connection brings us in frequent contact
   with him. On such occasions he often entices us by his cunning, but not
   to our delight; and being only half willing, our souls protest; and as
   soon as the sin is committed we are filled with self-loathing and
   contrition.

   And this reversal of our affections is not our work, but that of the
   Holy Spirit. Not that we deny that He often uses us as instruments, or
   prompts us to exert ourselves, but the changing of our inclinations is
   not our work, but the direct operation of God the Holy Spirit.

   How it is performed we can understand but partly. Essentially it is a
   mystery, just as much as regeneration. Being God, the Holy Spirit has
   access to our heart, He discovers our personality, the nature of our
   affections, and in what way their action may be reversed. But our
   inability to fathom this mystery does not in the least affect our faith
   in the matter.

   Since the dying of the old man is effected, not by our good works, but
   by the implanting of a disposition and inclination repugnant to the old
   man, our own work is entirely out of the question; for our own heart is
   inaccessible to us. We have no power over our inward person; we lack
   the means to create another inclination; and when we deny this we are
   self-deceived. God the Creator alone can do this, and in doing it He is
   irresistible. Hatred against the old man, once having entered the soul,
   is a power that simply overwhelms us. Even when enticed by him; we can
   not but hate him.

   The seventh chapter of Romans is very instructive in this respect. St.
   Paul says, "I delight in the law of God after the inward man," (Rom
   vii. 22) i.e., after my inward affections. There is indeed another law
   in his members, which brings him into captivity to the law of sin; but
   he has not the least love or sympathy for that law, but with the law of
   his mind wars against it.

   Any other representation contradicts this positive testimony, uttered
   by the mouth of the most excellent of the apostles, under the seal of
   the Holy Spirit. He that believes embraces the Son, and can not but
   receive impressions and be swayed by influences that cause his
   affections and inclinations to become radically changed. A believer is
   internally wrought upon. All his former dealings with the old
   man--pride, hardness of heart, deceit, and thirst for revenge--now fill
   him with horror; what was formerly to him the pride of life and the
   lust of the eyes is now vexation of spirit, as he realizes how shameful
   and abominable it is.

   So he gradually dies to the old man, until, in the hour of death, he is
   fully delivered. God's child remains the old man's grave-digger until
   the hour of his own departure.

   Nevertheless he dies to him so completely that at last he loses all
   confidence in him, thoroughly convinced that he is without excuse, an
   abominable wretch, a reprobate, and a deceiver, capable of all evil.
   And when occasionally he indulges in scornful mirth at the old man's
   pride and practises, it is not in boastfulness of his own work or of
   his fellow men, but glorying only in the gracious work of his God.

  The Work of God in Our Work.

   "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
   whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming
   of the Lord Jesus Christ."--1 Thess. v. 23.

   The difference between sanctification and good works should be well
   understood.

   Many confound the two, and believe that sanctification means to lead an
   honorable and virtuous life; and, since this is equal to good works,
   sanctification, without which no man shall see God, is made to consist
   in the earnest and diligent effort to do good works.

   But this reasoning is false. The grape should not be confounded with
   the vine, lightning with thunder, the birth with the conception, any
   more than sanctification with good works. Sanctification is the kernel
   from which the blade and full ear of good works shall spring; but this
   does not identify the kernel with the blade. The former lies in the
   ground and by its fibers attaches itself to the furrow internally. The
   latter shoots from the ground externally and visibly. So is
   sanctification the implanting of the germ, of the disposition, and
   inclination which shall produce the blossom and fruit of a good work.

   Sanctification is God's work in us, whereby He imparts to our members a
   holy disposition, inwardly filling us with delight in His law and with
   repugnance to sin. But good works are acts of man, which spring from
   this holy disposition. Hence sanctification is the source of good
   works, the lamp that shall shine with their light, the capital of which
   they are the interest.

   Allow us to repeat it: "sanctification" is a work of God; "Good works"
   are of men. "Sanctification" works internally; "good works" are
   external. "Sanctification" imparts something to man; "good works" take
   something out of him. "Sanctification" forces the root into the ground;
   to do "good works" forces the fruit out of the fruitful tree. To
   confound these two leads the people astray.

   The Pietist says: "Sanctification is man's work; it can not be insisted
   upon with sufficient emphasis. It is our best effort to be godly." And
   the Mystic maintains: "We can not do good works, and may not insist
   upon them for man is unable; God alone works them in him independently
   of him."

   Of course, both are equally wrong and unscriptural. The former, in
   reducing sanctification to good works, takes it out of God's hand and
   lays it upon man, who never can perform it; and the latter, in making
   good works take the place of sanctification, releases man from the task
   laid on him and claims that God will perform it. Both errors must be
   opposed.

   Both sanctification and good works should receive recognition.
   Ministers of the Word, and through them the people of God, should
   understand that sanctification is an act of God that He performs in
   man; and that God has commanded man to do good works to the glory of
   His name. And this will have twofold effect: (1) God's people will
   acknowledge their complete inability to receive a holy disposition
   otherwise than as a gift of free grace, and then they will earnestly
   pray for this grace. (2) They will pray that His elect, in whom this
   work is already wrought, may show it forth in God-glorifying works:
   "Chosen in Christ Jesus, that we should be holy and without blame
   before Him in love" (Ephes. i. 4).

   Tho this distinction is very clear, two things may cause confusion:

   First, the fact that holiness may be attributed to the good works
   themselves. One may be holy, but also do holy works. The Confession
   speaks of the "many holy works which Christ has done for us and in our
   stead" (art. 22). Hence holiness maybe external and internal.

   The following passages refer, not to sanctification, but to good works:
   "Seeing that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of
   persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation?" (2 Peter iii. 11).
   "As He which hath called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of
   conversation" (1 Peter i. 15). "That we being delivered out of the
   hands of our enemies, may serve Him without fear, in holiness and
   righteousness all the days of our life" (Luke i. 75).

   We find that the word "holy" is used of both our inward disposition and
   of its result, the outward life. It may be said of the spring as well
   as of the water, that it contains iron; of the tree as well as of the
   fruit, that it is good; of the candle as well as of the light, that it
   is bright. And, since holiness may be attributed to both the inward
   disposition and the outward life, sanctification may be understood as
   referring to the sanctification of our life. This may lead to the
   supposition that an outwardly blameless life is the same thing as
   sanctification. And if this is so, then sanctification is but a duty
   imposed, and not a gift imparted. It should therefore be carefully
   noticed that the sanctification of the mind, affections, and
   dispositions is not our work, but God's; and that the holy life which
   springs from it is ours.

   Second, the other cause of confusion is the many Scripture passages
   that exhort and encourage us to sanctify, purify, and perfect our
   lives, yea, even "to perfect our holiness" (2 Cor. vii. 1); to "yield
   ourselves as servants to holiness" (Rom. vi. 19); and to be "unblamable
   in holiness" (1 Thess. iii. 13), etc.

   And we should not weaken these passages, as the Mystics do; who say
   that these texts mean, not that we should yield our members, but that
   God Himself will take special care that they be so yielded. These are
   tricks that lead men to trifle with the Word. It is an abuse of the
   Scripture for the sake of introducing one's own theories under the
   cover of divine authority. The preachers who for fear of imposing
   responsibilities upon men abstain from exhortation, and dull the edge
   of the divine commandments by representing them as promises, take a
   heavy responsibility upon themselves.

   For altho we know that no man bas ever performed a single good work
   without God, who wrought in him both to will and to do; altho we
   heartily agree with the Confession, "That we are beholden to God for
   our good works and not God to us" (art. 24); and rejoice with the holy
   apostle in the fact, "That God has before ordained the good works that
   we should walk therein" (Eph. ii. 10); yet this does not absolve us
   from the duty of exhorting the brethren.

   It is a fact that God is pleased to use man as an instrument, and by
   the spur of his own ability and responsibility to incite him to
   activity. A cavalryman on the battle-field is fully aware how much he
   depends upon the good services of his horse; and also that the animal
   can not run unless God enabled it. Being a godly man, he prays before
   mounting that the Lord enable his horse to bring him victory; but after
   he is mounted, with spur and knee, rein and voice, he uses all his
   strength to make the horse do what it should do. And the same is true
   of sanctification. Unless the breath of the Lord blow through the
   garden of the soul, not a leaf can stir. The Lord alone performs the
   work from the beginning to the end. But He performs, it partly by the
   aid of means; and the instrument chosen is often man himself, who
   cooperates with God. And to this human instrumentality the Scripture
   refers when, in connection with sanctification, it admonishes us to
   good works.

   As in nature God gives the seed and the forces in the soil and rain and
   sunshine to mature the fruit of the earth, while at the same time He
   uses the farmer to perfect His work, so it is also in sanctification:
   God causes it to work effectually; but He employs the human instrument
   to cooperate with Him, as the saw works together with him that handles
   it.

   However, this should not be understood as tho in sanctification God had
   made Himself absolutely dependent upon the human instrument. This is
   impossible; by nature man can indeed mar sanctification, but never
   further it. By nature he hates and opposes it. Moreover, he is
   absolutely unable to produce from his own corrupt nature anything for
   his growth in sanctification. His instrumental cooperation should
   therefore not be abused either by ascribing to man a power for good, or
   to obscure the work of God.

   Careful discrimination is necessary. He that implants the holy
   disposition is the Lord. The combined exertions of all these
   instruments could not implant one single feature of the holy mind, any
   more than all the carpenter's tools together could draw the molding of
   one panel. The artist paints upon the canvas; but with all their
   exertions his palette, brush, and paint-box could never draw a single
   figure. The sculptor molds the image; but of themselves his chisel;
   mallet, and stool can not detach a single chip from the rough marble.
   To engrave the features of holiness in the sinner is a work in the
   highest sense artistic, unspeakably divine. And the Artist who executes
   it is the Lord as St. Paul calls Him, the Artist and Architect of the
   City which has foundations. The fact that the Lord is pleased to use
   instruments for some parts of the work does not impart to them any
   value, much less any ability to accomplish anything of themselves
   without the Artist. He is the only Worker.

   But as Artist He uses three different instruments, viz., the Word, His
   providential dealings, and the regenerate person himself.

   1. The Word is a vital power in the Church which pierces even to the
   dividing asunder of the joints and the marrow, and, as such it is a
   divinely ordained instrument to create impressions in a man; and these
   impressions are the means by which holy inclinations are implanted in
   his heart.

   2. Life's experiences also make impressions in us more or less lasting;
   and these God uses also to create holy dispositions.

   3. The third instrument refers to the effect of habit. Repeated sinful
   acts make the sinner bold and create sinful habits; in this way he
   cooperates to make himself a greater sinner. In a similar sense the
   saint cooperates in his own salvation by allowing the holy disposition
   to radiate in good works. The frequent act of doing good creates the
   habit. The habit gradually becomes a second nature. And it is this
   mighty influence of habit which God uses to teach us holiness. In this
   way God can make one saint instrumental in the sanctification of
   another.

   An architect builds a palace which makes him famous as an artist. It is
   true the contractor, an important person in his place, erects the
   structure; but his name is scarcely mentioned, it is the architect
   alone for whom all the praise is reserved. In sanctification it is not
   the Word by itself that is effectual, but that Word handled by the Holy
   Spirit. Neither is it the experience of life alone, but that experience
   employed by the Holy Artist. Neither is it the regenerate person who
   serves as foreman, but the glorious, Triune God, in whose service he
   labors.

  XIV.

  The Person Sanctified.

   "The putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh."--Col. ii. 11.

   Sanctification embraces the whole man, body and soul, with all the
   parts, members, and functions that belong to each respectively. It
   embraces his person and, all of his person. This is why sanctification
   progresses from the hour of regeneration all through life, and can be
   completed only in and through death.

   St. Paul prays for the church of Thessalonica: "The God of peace
   sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be
   preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." (1
   Thess. v. 23) Sanctification is essentially a work of one piece, simply
   because our person is not pieced together, but is organically one in
   all its parts.

   The sinner's holiness or unholiness embraces his whole being. He is a
   sinner not only in his body, but in his soul, and even more so and in
   his soul not only because his will is unholy, but also because his
   understanding is unholy, and even more so. The memory, the imagination,
   and all that belongs to him as a man are radically defiled, desecrated,
   and corrupted by sin. He lies in the midst of death. Even in a small
   child, every part is affected. Without the least exertion he learns a
   street-song, while it seems almost impossible to commit one stanza of a
   psalm.

   If sanctification has reference to the inherited stain, as
   justification to the inherited guilt, it follows that sanctification
   must extend as far as the inherited stain. If man's entire person is
   covered with the poison of the stain, it must be covered much more
   abundantly by sanctification.

   Sin is disturbance, derangement, discord, and warfare in home and
   heart, and is not overcome completely until superseded by holy peace.
   This is the reason why St. Paul calls the God of sanctification the God
   of peace; and so he prays for the Church that the God of peace sanctify
   them wholly, or literally, "unto the full end," so that the end of
   sanctification may be accomplished in them perfectly. [37]

   However, the starting-point of this grace lies not in the body, but in
   the soul. Sin started in the soul, not in the body; hence the
   mortification of sin must also begin in the soul.

   It is directed, first of all, to the consciousness and to its faculties
   of cognition, contemplation, reflection, and judgment. Sanctification
   proceeds, not from the will, but from the consciousness. Sanctification
   is to make conformable to the will of God, and this requires, in the
   first place, that His good and perfect and acceptable will become a
   living reality to the consciousness, conviction, and conscience. The
   things of which one is ignorant do not affect him; but ignorance of the
   divine will is sin, and this must be overcome first of all.

   But how? By committing to memory? By learning the Catechism? By no
   means. The sanctification of the consciousness consists in God's act of
   writing His law in our hearts. True, there are still a few traces of
   that law written in the sinner's heart, as the apostle writes that the
   Gentiles who are without the law are a law unto themselves; but this is
   at the most but the fermentation of a higher principle in a sinful
   person which can not maintain itself. The Nihilist and Communist of the
   day show to what extent the heart may lose the sense of the first
   principles of right and righteousness. But when the Scripture promises
   that the Lord shall write the law in their hearts, and that they shall
   teach no more every man his neighbor, saying, "Know the Lord, for all
   shall know him from the least unto the greatest," (Heb. viii. 11) it
   offers us something entirely different and far more glorious. And this
   is accomplished, not by outward study, but by inward apprehension; not
   by an exercise of the memory, but by a renewing of the mind, as St.
   Paul writes: "Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by
   the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and
   acceptable and perfect will of God."

   Ezekiel prophesied of this renewing of the mind when he said: "A new
   heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you."
   (Ezek. xxxvi. 26) Instruction formerly received may be used as a means
   to that end; but the instruction which the human spirit receives in
   sanctification is not human, but divine. Hence it is said: "They are
   taught of the Lord" (Isa. liv. 13); "Every man, therefore, that hath
   heard and learned of the Father cometh unto Me" (John vi. 45); "I will
   put My law into their minds, and will write it in their hearts." (Jer.
   xxxi. 33)

   Since the books of Moses emphasize the fact that the tables of the law
   were written, not by Moses, Aholiab, nor Bezaliel, but directly by
   God's own finger, it follows from the nature of the case that the
   Scripture intends to present this writing upon the tables of the heart,
   not as the work of man, but as the direct work of God. The
   sanctification of the human consciousness is wrought in us by God in a
   divine, unfathomable, and irresistible way; but not independently of
   the Word, for that Word itself is divine, and the preaching of the Word
   is divinely ordained and instituted. But, since the Word and the
   preaching can only present the matter to the consciousness, it is the
   Holy Ghost who makes the heart to understand it, declares it to the
   consciousness, works conviction, and causes the consciousness to assent
   to it, and thus enables it to feel the pressure which proceeds from
   that which is written on the heart.

   Hence the sanctification of the consciousness consists, not only in
   receiving new knowledge, and in being impressed with quickened
   conceptions, but also in having the reason qualified for the exercise
   of entirely different functions. For the natural man does not
   understand the things of the Spirit of God; but the spiritual man,
   i.e., he whose consciousness is regenerated, sanctified and enlightened
   discerns all things; for such a man, says St. Paul, has the mind of
   Christ.

   However, the sanctification of our consciousness does not complete the
   sanctification of our person. On the contrary, for altho the will is
   absolutely dependent upon the consciousness, yet even the will itself
   is corrupted by sin. It did not lose its functional operation; but, as
   in the sinner the judgment still judges and the feeling still feels, so
   is the will still able to will. But its ability to reach out in every
   direction is lost; and the calamity has befallen us that by nature we
   can not will what God wills.

   And that stiffness and hardness which prevent the will's free action in
   this respect must be removed. The Scripture calls this the taking away
   of the stony heart and the giving of a heart of flesh which is no
   longer hard and insensible. Where sin had bound the will by inclining
   it to evil, thereby depriving it of the power of bending in the
   opposite direction, i.e., toward God, the gracious gift of
   sanctification now comes to relieve that bending over to hell, and to
   give it power to incline to God.

   Formerly our knowledge and conviction of the oughtness of things did
   not avail; for they left our will powerless as a chained wheel, unable
   to turn in the right direction. But not only had the consciousness a
   better idea of and clearer insight into the oughtness of things, and we
   had assented to it, but the will was also inclined by correct volition
   to choose the good; then the work of God had attained its end, had
   accomplished its purpose; and had changed the whole man.

   And thus man regains also control over his passions. Every man has
   passions and propensities which sin has made unruly and uncontrollable.
   In fact, man is their toy; they can use him as they please. It is true
   the unconverted sometimes succeed in curbing and muzzling one passion,
   but always by becoming more hopelessly the slaves of another.
   Dissipation is conquered only by the excitement of avarice; sensuality
   by cherishing inward pride; anger by nursing the thirst for revenge.
   Kamosh is cast out only to make room for Molech; the north wind
   conjured away only to be followed by a blast from the east.

   But the passions of the saint are controlled in a different way.
   Sanctification gives them another direction. He feels their whip and
   spur, but they are to him the violence of a foreign power. Wherefore
   St. Paul declares "It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
   me." (Rom. vii. 17, 20) And no passion can overtake him which in the
   power of God he can not master and control.

   Sanctification embraces, in the second place, the body. Both sin and
   holiness affect the body not as tho it were the seat of sin, which is
   Manichean heresy, but in the sense in which Scripture disapproves the
   act of touching a corpse. The body is the instrument of the soul; hence
   the members may be used for holy or unholy purposes, and offer either
   their cooperation or resistance for such purposes. Who does not know
   that an excess of blood inflames the ugly temper and excites to anger;
   that irritable nerves make one impatient; and great muscular energy
   tempts to recklessness? Many are the connections between the operations
   of body and soul; and, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit brings the bodily
   members into subjection to the reign of the new life, sanctification
   does indeed affect the life of the body. This appears from the fact
   that the body is called the temple of the Holy Spirit. St. Paul calls
   it "the putting off of the body of sin of the flesh" (Col. ii. 11); and
   again he saith: "Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should
   obey the lusts thereof" (Rom. vi. 12).

   Hence the old man is just as bad and becomes even worse; but there is
   at the same time a gradual weakening--and thus dies to his evil lusts,
   while the new man continues not only holy and intact, but gradually
   masters us and enables us to present our bodies a living sacrifice,
   holy and well-pleasing to God, which is our reasonable service (Rom.
   xii. 1).

   All this is wrought by the Holy Spirit who dwells in our hearts, the
   Comforter, Guide, and Teacher of the desolate. Christ is far from us in
   heaven sitting at the right hand of God. But the Holy Spirit is poured
   forth. He dwells in the Church on earth. Hg abides with us as our
   Comforter:

   Hence we should not imagine that we are a full-rigged, well-provisioned
   craft which, at its own risk and without a pilot, swiftly carries us to
   the haven of rest; for without wind and tide we can not move our craft
   at all. The heart of the saint is a Bethel; when he rises from blessed
   dreams he is ever surprised to find that God is in this place and he
   knew it not. When we are called to speak, act, or fight, we do so as
   tho we were doing it all ourselves, not perceiving that it is Another
   who works in us both to will and to do. But as soon as we have finished
   the task successfully and agreeably to the will of God, as men of faith
   we prostrate ourselves before Him and cry, "Lord, the work was Thine."

   And this goes against the old man. Before the work is undertaken he is
   fearful and ill at ease; but as soon as it is finished he is full of
   boasting, and the incense of human praise is sweet in his nostrils. But
   God's child works in simplicity and spontaneously, brings the sacrifice
   of his labor hoping against hope, with all the exertion of the talent
   which God gave him. But the labor finished, he wonders how he ever
   accomplished it, and he finds the only solution in the fact that there
   is One who powerfully wrought in and through him.

   [37] This is not the place to discuss the opinion held by many, that 1
   Thess. v. 23 teaches trichotomy, i.e., the threefold division of man's
   being. Let this only be observed, that it does not read, "Ehdpopovs,"
   "in all your parts," followed by the summing up of those parts, spirit,
   soul, and body; but that it reads "O2.OTEXEGS," which refers, not to
   the parts, but to the final end, "TEXOS." Moreover, it should be
   noticed that in those passages which oppose the spiritual man to the
   natural--i.e., the pneumatical to the psychical, as in 1 Cor. ii. 14,
   15--the word "rvevpa" indicates the new life-principle, of which it
   never can be said that it be preserved blameless. For this 'rvevjua "
   is sinless by nature. Calvin explains "spirit" and "soul" by making
   them to refer to our rational and moral existence as beings endowed
   with reason and volition, both modes of the soul's existence.

  Good Works.

   "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
   which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." Ephes. ii.
   10.

   Good works are the ripe fruit from the tree which God has planted in
   sanctification.

   In the saint there is life; from that life workings proceed; and those
   workings are either good or evil. Hence good works are not added to
   sanctification for mere effect, but belong to it. The discussion of
   sanctification is not complete without the discussion of Good Works.

   Whatever man may be, works always proceed from him; and since works are
   never neutral, but either conform or do not conform to the divine law,
   it follows that every man's works are either good or evil, actual sins
   (Peccata actualia)or good works. In fact, every life has its own
   energizing. Without it it is no life. Properly speaking, life in the
   saint does not proceed from sanctification, but sanctification lends it
   tone, color, and character.

   In a garden where the conditions are all equal, and there is the same
   soil, the same fertilizer, etc., different fruit-trees are planted.
   Evidently, the working that makes the trees grow is from the soil; for
   if planted in the garret, they will not grow. But the cause that
   produces peaches on one tree and grapes on another is not in the soil,
   but in the trees. Hence we must distinguish the working itself from the
   shade, the tone, the character, the peculiar property which that
   working assumes. The wind that produces sweetest music from the Eolian
   harp, by blowing through a broken window-pane produces doleful sounds.
   It is one operation but different effects. In the meadow next to the
   tender clover grows the poisonous wolf's-milk. Yet both lift their
   little heads from the same soil and drink in the same air, sunlight,
   and rain. Altho the vital energy is the same, the difference in the
   seeds causes differences in the plants, and opposite effects.

   The same applies to the garden of the soul, where the human life is in
   full activity. But that same human life produces a base act to-day and
   a heroic act to-morrow. There is but one working, but the colors vary,
   it may be white or black, dark or light.

   And this we find, that in the garden of the soul all spontaneous growth
   is a growth of weeds; while the seed which God has planted produces
   precious fruit. The effects of sanctification are evident. It causes
   sweet waters to flow from a bitter fountain. It lends to every
   operation its own quality and property, and gives it a direction which
   works for good. And thus good works proceed from the man lost in
   himself.

   Of course, in the root, this apparently identical working is twofold.
   One springs from the old nature, the other from the new; the one from
   the natural, the other from the supernatural. But since this
   distinction was discussed at large in the chapter on Regeneration, we
   treat it now simply from the unity of the person:

   Altho we heartily agree with the Confession, "That a regenerated person
   has in him a twofold life: the one temporal and corporeal, that which
   he has from the first birth and is common to all men; the other
   spiritual and heavenly, which is given him in the second birth, and
   which is peculiar to God's elect" (art. 35); yet this does not affect
   the unity of the person, nor does it alter the fact that the operations
   of both the old and the new life are my operations. If I divide my
   person, and take the natural and the supernatural each by itself, then
   there is no sanctification at all; for the corrupt life of my old
   nature is not sanctified, but crucified, dead, and buried; and my
   heavenly, spiritual, and regenerated life can not be sanctified
   inasmuch as it never was sinful nor ever can be. Hence in
   sanctification we have to consider life from the viewpoint of the unity
   and indivisibility of the person. The man who was first wedded to the
   corrupt nature, and who is now wedded to the new man, was then evil and
   is now to become good; wherefore his life must receive the holy desire,
   inclination, and disposition. And then only it is possible for it to
   produce good works.

   A work is good when it is conformable to the divine law.

   1. The first point is that God alone possesses the right to determine
   what is good or evil.

   Man also can acquire this discernment, but only by being taught of God.
   But as soon as he presumes himself to determine the difference between
   good and evil, He violates the divine majesty and God's inalienable
   right to be God. Not one man, nor many men, nor all men and angels
   together may do this. It does not belong to them. It is the eternal
   prerogative of the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth. He alone
   determines good and evil, for every creature, for time and eternity.

   That which He demands of each life shall be the law of that life, of
   all that belongs to it, and under all circumstances; a law in which all
   the divine ordinances are comprehended. His law, tho its principles are
   briefly comprehended in the Ten Commandments, rises from these ten
   stems in branches and boughs broad and dense, and forms in its
   completeness one immeasurable roof of leaves which overshadows the
   entire human family in all its variegations.

   Hence there is not the remotest chance here to compromise. God's will
   and law are absolute; rule over all; are binding in every domain, and
   can never be repealed. And where, in the delicate works of a watch, the
   thousandth part of a millimeter is allowed to a wheel for variation, in
   the divine law such play is unthinkable. The law of God brooks not even
   the deviation of a hair's breadth, nor of any infinitesimal fraction
   thereof.

   Hence a good work does not signify a work merely not evil; nor a work
   containing some good, or simply passable; nor a work whose good
   intention is evident. But a good work is nothing else and nothing less
   than a good work. And it is not good unless it is absolutely good,
   i.e., in all its parts equally conformable to the divine will and law.
   A peach is not half a pear and half a grape, but absolutely a peach; so
   a good work is not merely passable, partly well intentioned, but
   absolutely conformable to what God has determined to be good with
   regard to that work.

   It is readily seen that unless sanctification were adapted to enable
   man to perform such a work, he would never accomplish it. As it is the
   peculiar habit of a peach-tree, through its ascending life, to impart
   to the fruit the flavor of the peach, and of the grape-vine to give to
   its fruit the flavor of the grape, so it is the peculiar quality of the
   soul sanctified in principle to impart to its fruit the flavor of the
   law. Sanctification does not merely inspire the soul with a desire for
   something higher, but it imparts to it such a disposition, tone, shade,
   flavor, and character that it yields to the divine law. And the law
   puts its impress upon the soul. The soul's aspiration is no more a
   vague ideal, but it has a positive pleasure in and a desire and love
   for all, the commandments of God. And, since sanctification engrafts
   the law upon the soul, it is possible that the working which follows
   should be conformable to the law.

   We say "possible," for from his own sad experience God's child knows
   that it is possible to be otherwise, and that many summers come and go
   without reaping from his branches any noticeable harvest for the glory
   of God.

   2. This brings us to the second point. A good work must be of faith.

   Sanctification itself is not of faith. It has nothing to do with faith.
   It is wrought by God Himself. What could faith then accomplish in this
   respect?

   But it is different with reference to good works; for they must be our
   good works. Man is and should be passive in all other respects, but not
   in his work. Work is the end of one's passive condition. To work and to
   be passive are opposites. To imagine that work can be passive or
   actively passive is like imagining that a circle is square, that ink is
   white, that water is dry. Wherefore the Heidelberg Catechism rightly
   asks: "Why must we still do good works?"

   Hence there can be no good work unless it is wrought by ourselves. And
   every representation as tho man did not perform good works, but that
   the Holy Spirit performs them in him and in his place, is to subvert
   the Gospel and to wrest the Scripture.

   The work of Christ is vicarious, that of the Holy Spirit is not. He
   works in man, but not in his place. And however extensive His work may
   be in us, being wrought independently of us, it can never be counted as
   our own. Christ died and rose from the dead for us and independently of
   us. But the Holy Spirit can not draw fruit from the tree except our ego
   executes the work.

   But--and this should be emphasized--our ego can not execute it except
   the " work is wrought in us with power." The inward, higher life does
   not act like the sap in the vine, for this enters the vine naturally.
   But the working of the holy life is different. Altho a holy disposition
   is implanted, God's child does not produce any good fruit of himself.
   Altho well furnished and well equipped, if left to himself he produces
   nothing; not a single good work, however small.

   The most skilful diamond-cutter, tho supplied with the best tools, can
   not furnish the smallest diamond rose except the proprietor of the
   establishment gives him the diamond, the steam-power in his tools, and
   even the gas-light upon his hands. In like manner it is impossible for
   the most excellent among God's children, tho their souls be well
   equipped, to furnish a single good work, except the Proprietor of the
   holy-art establishment gives them the material, the power, and the
   light.

   Hence the content and entire form of every good work is not of man, but
   of the Holy Ghost, so that when it is finished we owe thanks to God,
   and not He to us. In every man who performs a good work He works both
   to will and to do.

   But when the Holy Spirit has furnished everything necessary, then one
   thing is still lacking, viz., that the saint do it and make the work
   his own. And this is the wonderful act of faith.

   There is not one good work which God has not prepared before, that we
   should walk in it; and this is why it is not wrought until we walk in
   it. The Lord says to Ezekiel, "I will cause you to walk in my
   statutes," (Ezek. xxxvi. 27) but the Lord does not cause us to walk
   therein until we actually walk in them. We shall neither be carried nor
   be wheeled into them. This would have no value before the divine
   Majesty; that would be no art. Even we can wheel the cripple in his
   carriage; but the art of making him to walk, yea, even to leap as a
   hart, is not human, but worthy of God alone. And we may not allow this
   to be taken from Him by a sickly mysticism, and thus rob God of this
   glory.

   To say, as many do, that the Lord carries His children imperceptibly
   into good paths, and that this constitutes their good works, is to
   despise holy things. No one should touch the honor of our God; and we
   may not rest until the pure doctrine burns again from the candlestick:
   that the power of God is manifest in the fact that He causes the
   cripple to walk, to run, and to leap as a hart.

   And this is the act of faith, i.e., that wonderful act of the soul of
   casting itself into the deep, knowing that it shall fall into the
   everlasting arms of mercy, tho it is utterly unable to see. Faith in
   this respect is to agree with the divine will; to accept the good work
   which God has prepared for us, as our own; to appropriate to ourselves
   what God gives us.

   An awkward schoolboy has to make a speech before a strange audience. It
   is a difficult task, and he does not even know how to begin. All his
   own efforts are useless. Then his father calls him and says: "If you
   commit this little speech which I have prepared, and recite it without
   missing a word, it will be a success." And the boy obeys. There is
   nothing of himself--it is all his father's work; he merely believes
   that what his father has prepared for him is good. And in this
   confidence he goes before the strange audience, delivers his father's
   composition, and succeeds. However, the writing of the speech did not
   end the matter, and it could not be ended until the boy had done his
   part. When God has prepared the good work for us, the matter is not
   ended until we do what God has prepared for us.

   Coming home the boy does not proudly ask a reward, but with gratitude
   he embraces his father for his love and faithfulness. Having obtained
   success, God's children are profoundly thankful for their Father's
   excellent help; and they acknowledge that they owe it all to Him. And
   if He is pleased to give them a reward, it is not because they have
   deserved it; for if it were a question of desert, the children would
   have to give everything to the Father! But it is merely a reward of
   love for the future support of their faith.

  XVI.

  Self-Denial.

   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his
   cross, and follow Me."--Matt. xvi. 24.

   Good works are not the saint's sanctification, any more than drops of
   water are the fountain; but they spring as crystal drops from the
   fountain of sanctification. They are good, not when the saint intends
   them to be good, but when they conform to the divine law and proceed
   from a true faith. Yet the intention is of great importance; the Church
   has always taught that a work could not be called good unless it is
   directed to the glory of God.

   This is a vital point which must animate and give direction to the
   whole matter: only to the glory of God. Every other intention makes the
   good work evil. Even the effort to do good works is impossible without
   the "Soli Deo Gloria."

   This is the reason why so many well-meant efforts at so-called
   sanctification become sinful. For the man who applies himself earnestly
   and diligently to good works, solely to attain a holier status and thus
   become a holier person, has lost his reward. His end in view is not
   God, but himself; and while every good work humbles a man and real
   sanctification leads to the breaking down and casting out of self, this
   wrongly planned sanctification causes self-exaltation and spiritual
   pride.

   To think that by self-sanctification God is honored and His glory
   exalted is self-deception. The divine honor and majesty are so holy and
   exalted that His glory must be the direct end in view. To work for
   self-sanctification directly, and for His honor indirectly, is unworthy
   of His holiness.

   The end and aim of all things must be the Lord God alone. Justice must
   dwell in the land, not only to preserve order, but to remove iniquity
   from before, the presence of the Lord. The missionary cause must be
   supported not only to convert souls, but to summon the nations to
   appear in Zion before God. Prayer must be offered not only to obtain
   the good which is bestowed without prayer, but because every creature,
   morning and evening, must lie in the dust, crying, "Holy, holy, holy is
   the Lord!" making the whole earth full of His glory. And hence every
   creature must do good works, and all the children of God can do good
   works; not that they may become a little more holy, but that the glory
   of holiness might shine to the praise of our God.

   3. This third point should therefore never be omitted. Tho our works
   are according to the law and of faith, but not directed to the glory of
   God, they can not please Him. It avails nothing, tho the bow be
   strongly bent and the cord of the best material, if the arrow upon the
   cord be not turned in the right direction.

   The doctrine of Good Works touches the most delicate and most sensitive
   of our internal emotions, viz., self-denial.

   Superficial minds, poor in grace and godliness, speak of self-denial
   but rarely, and then without understanding its meaning. They think that
   it consists in making room for others; in argument to be the least; to
   renounce pleasure or profit for a higher purpose; to care for others,
   not for self. Surely this is a precious fruit; earnestly to be desired;
   and if it were found more abundantly among the children of God we
   should thank Him for it. But, alas! there is such leanness of soul even
   in the most earnest, so much selfishness, ambition, anger, confidence
   in the creature, that every manifestation of nobler impulse has a most
   refreshing effect.

   But the question now before us is this, whether such making room for
   others, such self-sacrifice, deserves the name of self-denial. And the
   answer must be a most emphatic "No!" The saint's self-denial has
   reference, not to man, but to God, and for this reason it is
   superlatively high and holy, difficult and almost impossible.

   Of course God's child loves his heavenly Father, but not with an
   unalterable love. In spite of his love he is sometimes very unlovely.
   Still, when the question echoes through his soul, "Simon Bar-Jonah,
   lovest thou Me?" (John xxi. 15-17) and he feels tempted by
   self-reproach to say, "No, Lord," then the response flashes from the
   bottom of his soul against all contradiction: "Yes, Lord, Thou knowest
   that I love Thee." (John xxi. 17)

   Therefore nothing would seem more natural than to find pleasure in
   denying himself for God's sake. And this is actually the case. He
   spends his happiest moments in sincere self-denial; for then he is
   never alone, but always with Jesus, whom he follows. Then he realizes
   the holiness and transcendent glory of the claim: "If any man will come
   after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."
   (Matt. xvi. 24; Mark viii. 34; Luke ix. 23)

   But while the blessedness of his former self-denials is still fresh in
   his memory, when called to a new act of the same nature he shrinks from
   it and finds it almost impossible. Self-denial extends so far. Its
   depths can not be fathomed. When the plummet has descended the whole
   length of the line, there is still such a yawning depth beneath that
   actually the bottom is never touched. It refers, not to a few things,
   but to all things. It embraces our entire life and existence, with all
   that is in us, of us, and around us; our entire environment,
   reputation, position, influence, and possession; it includes all the
   ties of blood and affection that bind us to wife and children, parents
   and brothers, friends and associates; all our past, present, and
   future; all our gifts, talents, and endowment; all the ramifications
   and extensions of our outward and inward life; the rich life of the
   soul and the tenderest emotions of our holier impulses; our conflict
   and our strife; our faith, hope, and love--yea, our inheritance in the
   Son, our place in the mansions above, and the crown which the righteous
   judge shall one day give us; and as such, in that entire scope of life,
   we must deny ourselves before God.

   We are, to use an illustration, in all our life and existence like a
   fruit-tree, broadly rooted, full grown, planted in fertile soil,
   adorned with a crown of many branches and a glorious roof of leaves;
   and like that tree with its roots far and wide in the earth, and its
   branches high and broad in the air, are we deeply rooted, possessing an
   existence obtained by means of money, reputation, property, and
   descent, faith, hope, love, and the promises of God. And to that whole
   tree, to that entire unit, from deepest root to highest bough, which as
   our ego, full of might and majesty, stands before our consciousness and
   in our life, to all this the ax must be laid; of all this the
   self-denying soul must say: "God is all and I am nothing."

   Many say, "This is correct and exactly my idea," and say it quite too
   often; for when these most difficult and excellent words again and
   again pass the lips as mere hollow sounds, they strike a discord to the
   earnest, sensitive soul. But when we grasp the thought as an actual
   fact, then we find that this denial of our entire existence and being
   is almost entirely beyond our grasp. Self can minify itself to such
   extent that we really think that it is gone and denied, while at the
   same time it stands behind our back, grinning with Satanic glee. Self,
   big and inflated, is not hard to deny. In this way the unconverted
   stands before God, but not the saint. That has been taken from him.
   Such is no more the impulse of his desire. But self shrunk, reduced
   partly unclothed, hiding behind pious emotions and piles of good works,
   is extremely dangerous. For what more is there to be denied? There is
   scarcely anything left. He seeks no longer the world, nor his own
   glory; his only end in view is the glory of God. At least, so he
   thinks. But he is mistaken. Self is there still. It is like a spring
   tightly bent for a time, but only to rebound with accumulated force.
   And what was called self-denial is really nothing else than self taking
   care of its own. And that is the worst of it, self is so dangerously
   cunning. The heart of man is "deceitful above all things and
   desperately wicked; who can know it?"

   When we are inclined to sin, self leaves its hiding-place and with all
   its power labors hard to make us sin. But when the Holy Spirit woos and
   constrains us, weaning us from sin, then, slunk in a corner, it hides
   itself, decoying us into the delusion that it has ceased to be. It is
   then that, with evident satisfaction, deluded piety asks whether the
   denial of self is not complete.

   But the true saint is known by this: while the self-deluded one is
   satisfied with this spiritual trickery, he is not. He discovers the
   trick. Then he reproaches himself. He drives self from, its place of
   concealment. He scolds and cursed that evil being that always stands
   between him and his God. And with groans he supplicates. "Almighty,
   merciful, and gracious God, have mercy upon me."

   Self-denial is not an outward act, but an inward turning of our being.
   As the steamship is turned about by the rudder, which is swung by the
   means of a wheel, so there is within our being a rudder, or whatever
   you may call it, which is turned by a small wheel, and as we turn the
   entire craft either leeward or windward, we deny either self or God. In
   its deepest sense we always deny either the one or the other. When we
   stand well we deny self; in all other cases we deny God. And the
   internal wheel by which we turn the entire craft of our ego is our
   intention. The rudder determines the course of the ship; not its
   rigging and cargo; nor the character of the crew, but its direction,
   the destination of the voyage, its final haven. Hence, when we see our
   craft steering away from God, we swing the rudder the other way and
   compel it to turn toward God.

   Notice the rigging and the cargo. The former may be magnificent:
   excellent talent, superior mind, a rich state of grace. The latter may
   be very precious: a treasure of knowledge, of moral power, of
   consecrated love, of melting and adoring piety. And yet with that
   excellent rigging and that precious cargo, we can steer our craft away
   from God and aim at self. Then only is there self-denial when, without
   regard to rigging and lading, a man causes his craft to run directly to
   the glory of God.

   The intention is everything. And it is this very intention which can so
   bitterly mislead us. That small wheel of our intentions is so
   exceedingly sensitive that a mere touch of the finger can reverse its
   action. This is why we are such ready believers in the goodness and
   beauty of our intentions.

   Hence the need of deep, correct, intimate knowledge of self. And who
   possesses this? And since by His light the Holy Spirit constantly
   refines and chastens our self-knowledge, is it not perfectly natural
   that, while to-day we imagine ourselves to be quite advanced in
   self-denial, only next week we discover how bitterly mistaken we are?

   To seek and look for one's highest good and eternal salvation, not in
   every creature, but in God; to use spiritual or material gifts not for
   ourselves, but for His glory; to esteem all perishable things of no
   account compared to the eternal; unwilling to be one's own lord, but as
   God's servant to enter His employ; no longer to possess any precious
   things, as money or treasure, or even one's children, as one's own, but
   to know oneself the appointed steward of the Lord; to have no more care
   or anxious thought; but renouncing every trust in man, in capital or
   fixed income, or in any other creature, to trust only and solely in the
   faithful God; to be at peace with one's lot and with God's will; and,
   finally, to direct all intentions and emotions away from oneself upon
   the Beloved and Glorious One,--is this not far-reaching? And can our
   own progress in regard to it ever satisfy us?

   And yet such self-denial is required to render our works good works
   indeed, in which the angels can rejoice.

   Thus the things which the Holy Spirit took from Christ to give unto us
   return to our Surety; for it is evident that not one of our good works
   can ever be complete in that sense. Our self-denial is never perfect.
   Hence the sad complaint that "our best works are ever polluted before
   God"; and the prayer for the cleansing even, of our good works.

   And this must be so; it has been divinely ordained that God's children
   shall never leave Christ. If they really obtained perfection they would
   lose sight of their Surety; but the fact that even their best effort is
   defiled drives them to Christ for the atonement and cleansing in His
   blood. Self-denial is a fruit of the atonement made perfect only by the
   atonement. And thus, in the growing and ripening of spiritual fruit,
   God uses our thoughts, words, and deeds as instruments of
   sanctification.

   For does not the exercise of frequent self-denial and the subsequent
   yielding of the fruit of righteousness, under the Spirit's gracious
   operation, create holy habits in the soul? Is not in this way the
   natural bent of the heart transferred from Satan to God? And when the
   Holy Spirit makes these holy habits, this bent of the heart toward
   holiness, a permanent disposition, then we have become fellow workers
   with God in our own sanctification. Nor is it as tho He did one part
   and we another, but He using our work as a chisel in the sculpturing of
   our own soul.

   And from this motive the faithful ministers of the Word should
   persuade, incite, and constrain believers to be always abounding in the
   work of the Lord. Sanctification must be preached as with the mouth of
   loudest trumpet. The Church of Christ imperatively needs it. The word
   which declares that God is a God who justifieth the ungodly may not be
   severed from that other word: "Be ye holy, for I am holy." (Lev. xx. 7;
   1 Peter i. 16) The operations of the Word and of the Holy Spirit flow
   together. Therefore every young disciple of Christ should not only
   confess His name and live according to the desires of his heart, but
   flee from worldly lusts to walk holily and sincerely before the Lord.

   Ministers of the Word should be careful not to conceal the majesty of
   the Lord Jehovah behind the cross of Christ. The responsibility must be
   fearful, if ever it should appear that our preaching of the cross of
   Christ, instead of having smothered sin, had quenched holy living.

LOVE.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XVII.

  Natural Love.

   "And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in
   our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."--Rom. v. 5.

   Sanctification does not exhaust the work of the Holy Spirit. It is an
   extraordinary work, necessitated by man's fall into sin. Love, of which
   we now will treat, is His deepest and most proper work, which He would
   have wrought even if sin had never been heard of; which He will
   continue after death; which He works now already in the angels, and
   which He will continue in us in the mansions of the Father's house
   evermore. Necessarily, across the path of quickening love falls the
   dark shadow of that terrible operation of judgment and hardening which
   the Holy Spirit works in the lost. We will close with a sketch of the
   unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost.

   Our subject is not love in general, but Love. The difference is
   evident. Love signifies the only pure, true, divine Love; by love in
   general is understood every expression of kindness, attachment, mutual
   affection, and devotion wherein are seen reflections of the glory of
   Eternal Love.

   Love in its general sense is also found in the world of animals; a love
   so strong sometimes that it shames man, casting reproach upon his
   conscience. The tenderness of the mother hen is proverbial. The same
   hen which at other times runs away at the distant approach of dog or
   cat, flies at the ugliest cat or fiercest bulldog when she has chickens
   to defend. Every mother bird defends her eggs at the price of her life.
   And altho neither cat nor dog had the least consideration for the
   mother love of hen or duck, yet both manifest the same love for their
   young ones. The most bloodthirsty animals, even tigers and hyenas, are
   never more enraged than when the hunter approaches their whelps too
   closely. It is unnecessary to say that love in this sense has no moral
   value. Yet it is not valueless. Christ made the love of the mother hen
   a type of His own love for His people and for Jerusalem. And when our
   small boys are furious when they see the male rabbit kill his young
   while the female fights for them, there is in their boyish hearts a
   pure voice of praise for the superior love of that little mother.
   However, praise for this love which is merely instinctive, increated,
   and irresistible belongs, not to the mother hen or mother lion, but to
   Him who created it in them.

   Turning from the love of instinct to the world of men, we are surprised
   to meet phenomena closely resembling it. A coquettish maiden,
   apparently devoid of all devotion, becomes a wife and mother, and
   suddenly she seems to have been initiated into the mysteries of love.,
   Her infant is the only object of all her thoughts. She suffers for it
   without complaint, fondles and cherishes it; and if a cruel dog were to
   attack the babe, as a heroine the otherwise timid maiden would fight
   the monster.

   And yet with all these similarities there is a difference. Love in that
   mother is weaker than in the animal. For hours she can leave her child
   in the care of others, while the brooding mother bird scarcely leaves
   the nest at all. The former has affection for other members of the
   family, but the latter with shrieks drives away all that dare approach
   the nest. In a word, the animal's maternal love is more absolute, and
   in this respect excels the love of the young mother. But when the
   chickens are half grown, the mother forgets and forsakes them; while
   the love of most mothers for their tender infants gradually assumes a
   nobler character, rising from instinctive love to spiritual love. A
   mother's power lies in the fact that she prays for her child.

   Evidently we must distinguish here two kinds of love: a lower form
   which springs from the blood, which the mother has in common with the
   bird, but which is less constant; and a superior love of another sort
   lacking in the hen, by which the human far surpasses the animal.

   This lower form is from the blood; not altogether instinctive as in the
   dove, yet nearly so, i.e., independent of the moral development of the
   mother. This can be seen in girls of inferior moral development, who,
   when they become mothers, fall almost desperately in love with their
   babes; while in others, who stand much higher morally, maternal love is
   much more moderate. And this shows that the irresistible passion of
   maternal love lacks a higher motive. Like the animal's love it springs
   from nature. And when we see and enjoy the spectacle, we realize that
   the glory of it belongs, not to the woman, but to Him whose work we
   admire in the inclinations of the creature.

   Next to this instinctive love we find in the mother something superior;
   not only in the few, but in all. And we say this in spite of the fact
   that there are unnatural mothers who are almost entirely devoid of this
   higher love. Only, it should be remembered, that the human soul
   contains much that is suppressed, which, once was active; that in
   dehumanized women, when only partly reclaimed, this nobler feature
   often reappears; yea, that in the lives of such mothers, amid sin and
   shame, there are momentary sparks of a higher love which illumine their
   moral darkness like a flash of lightning.

   This higher grade of maternal love bears an entirely different
   character. The sight of the sweet and lovely babe may support it, but
   can not account for it, nor produce it. It has a higher origin. Its
   sign is: a mother carrying her child to holy Baptism. For altho much of
   this is done out of custom and from love of display, yet essentially it
   is the declaration that a human child is greater than young bird or
   animal's whelp. Even when the French Revolution had temporarily
   abolished holy Baptism, it replaced it by a sort of political baptism.
   The young mother is constrained to see in her child something greater
   than mere "clods of infant flesh." And altho in many mothers it has
   become almost imperceptible, sunk so low that many have been seen to
   drag their children into the paths of sin; yet in nobler natures, and
   under more favorable circumstances, this refreshing parental love has
   the power to develop the energy of the moral growth of future
   generations. In understanding the difference between father and mother
   one will be able to distinguish, this lower and higher mother love,
   even in their finer variations. Of course, the instinctive love is not
   so strong in the father as in the mother; hence the love which bears
   the moral character of duty and vocation is more conspicuous in the
   former.

   But even where this wonderful mingling of instinctive and moral love in
   the mutual love of husband and wife manifests itself most beautifully,
   in parental love and by counter-action in filial love, and as a
   connecting link in fraternal love, it is still a form of love that can
   exist in total independence of the conscious love of God. Often it
   strongly expresses itself among pronounced unbelievers.

   And the same is true of that freer expression of love which,
   independently of the ties of blood, often develops itself in beautiful
   forms between friends, between congenial minds, between comrades in the
   same struggle, between the leaders and the led; yea, which from the
   things visible can rise to embrace the things invisible, and unfold
   itself in fairest forms of love for art and science, for king and
   country, for the nation and its history, for inherited rights and
   privileges--in brief, for all that inspires the breast with the noble
   feelings of consecration and sacrifice. For, whatever its wealth and
   scintillating beauty may be, in itself it is apart from the Love of the
   Eternal. In order not to betray their accomplices, hardened criminals
   have endured cruel tortures upon the rack with marvelous constancy.
   Communists, dying upon the barricades of Paris in defense of the most
   blasphemous barbarism, have displayed a heroism similar to that of our
   heroes at Waterloo and Dogger-Bank. Profane and wanton soldiers have
   cast themselves upon the enemy with rare contempt of death. But in all
   these manifestations of love, blood heated by passion on the one hand,
   and impure motives on the other, may play their part and rob it almost
   entirely of its divine character.

   Yea, even in its highest manifestations among men, such as pity for the
   suffering and mercy toward the fallen and perishing, it may still be
   devoid of the spark of holy Love. There are natural men who can not
   bear the sight of suffering; who are so deeply affected by the
   heart-breaking spectacles of sorrow and mourning that they must show
   pity; to whom the offering of sympathy is a natural necessity; who
   count the soothing of other men's sorrow a joy rather than a sacrifice.

   But even in this highest form, most closely approaching the divine
   mercies, it is frequently without any connection with the Eternal Love.
   It may be an impulse from instinct, an inclination from temperament,
   the effect of a noble example, or for the sake of fame almost
   everywhere obtainable by works of mercy; but the love of Christ is
   lacking. It is not the throbbing of the Love of God that vibrates in
   these manifestations. There is love that is to be appreciated; but the
   Love of which St. John declares that God is Love, is found only when
   the Holy Spirit enters the soul and teaches it to glory "In the love of
   God which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is
   given us." (Rom. v. 5)

  Love in the Triune Being of God.

   "God is Love."--1 John iv. 8.

   Between natural love even in its highest forms and Holy Love there is a
   wide chasm. This had to be emphasized so that our readers might not
   mistake the nature of Love. Many say that God is Love, but measure His
   Love by the love of men. They study love's being and manifestations in
   others and in themselves, and then think themselves competent to judge
   that this human love, in a more perfect form, is the Love of God. Of
   course they are wrong. Essential Love must be studied as it is in God
   Himself; as He has manifested it in His Word. And the scintillations of
   the creature's feeble love must be looked upon only as sparks from the
   fire of the divine Love.

   Our God is the very liberal Fountain of all good. Love being the
   highest good, God must be the very liberal Fountain of all Love. And
   from that Fountain flows every earthly love of whatever name, however
   faint or feeble. The Creator alone can create in His creature the
   irresistible love of instinct, in which we see a display of His glory.
   For the same end He created a strong creaturely attachment, not wholly
   instinctive, yet to some extent unconsciously active; to this belong
   the mother's love for her babe, love at first sight, brotherly love,
   etc. Higher than this is the love of moral kinship, whereby He has
   disposed spirit to spirit for congenial fellowship and mutual love.
   These are three forms in which is found something of the Love of God,
   but still belonging to Creation and Providence, in no wise partaking of
   the treasure of the divine Life.

   Love on earth adopts this higher character only when it becomes
   self-consecrating, self-denying, self-sacrificing; when the object of
   love does not attract, but only repels. The devoted nurse caring for
   the pest-stricken stranger finds nothing in him to attract her; rather
   the reverse. And still she stays, she perseveres, not only from a sense
   of duty, but attracted by the misery and desolation of the sufferer.
   This is indeed the effect of a higher love, which flows from the
   Fountain of Eternal Love. That nurse exhibits devotion to the
   invisible, apprehension of the spiritual.

   And altho God has so constituted our nervous system that suffering
   causes us discomfort, that the sight of pain affects us painfully, so
   that from a mere fellow feeling we are instantly ready to bear relief
   to the sufferer, yet that higher form of love usually rises from the
   lower nervous life to a higher expression which is impossible without
   an inward operation of grace.

   It thus prepares the way for the highest love, that directs itself not
   only to the invisible things, but to the Invisible One, attracting the
   soul toward Him with irresistible drawings. And only then is Love
   itself reached.

   The Word declares that God is Love, and the Spirit's testimony says in
   every heart: "Amen, not in us, but in Thee, O Eternal One. Thou art
   Love. There is no love that does not spring from Thee! " And this is a
   mystery that men and angels fail to fathom. Who ever expressed its
   perfection in words? Who does not realize that it is a harmony
   marvelously beautiful, blessed, and divine which the confused ear of
   the creature can not fully appreciate? Men confess it, drink in its
   sweetness and loveliness; the heart is blessed and cherished by it; but
   after the bliss is tasted and the cup taken from the lips, we know no
   more of the nature of Love than the babe that has enjoyed love at his
   mother's breast. We can not describe or analyze it; we can not fathom
   or penetrate its hidden essence. It takes possession of us, pervades
   us, refreshes us; but as the wind, of which we know not whence it
   cometh and whither it goeth, so in our best moments are the wonderful
   drawings of the Love of our God. It is not created nor conceived. It is
   eternal as God Himself. Love was never outside of Him, so as to come to
   Him from elsewhere; nor for a single moment throughout eternity was He
   without it. Without bearing in Himself deep, eternal Love, without
   being Love, He can not be our God.

   Superficial minds, however, conceive of the Love of God only as
   forgiving sin; as too good to tolerate suffering; too peaceable to
   allow war. But the Word teaches that the Love of God is a holy Love,
   intolerant of evil, for its own sake causing the sinner to suffer that
   he may turn from his false joys. It was this very Love that said in
   Paradise, immediately after the breach of sin: "I will put enmity!"

   God's children have derived from the Word deeper and richer conceptions
   of the divine Love, for they confess a Triune God, Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost, one God in three Persons: the Father, who generates; the
   Son, who is generated; and the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from both
   Father and Son. And the Love-life whereby these Three mutually love
   each other is the Eternal Being Himself. This alone is the true and
   real life of Love. The entire Scripture teaches that nothing is more
   precious and glorious than the Love of the Father for the Son, and of
   the Son for the Father, and of the Holy Spirit for both.

   This Love is nameless: human tongue has no words to express it; no
   creature may inquisitively look into its eternal depths. It is the
   great and impenetrable mystery. We listen to its music and adore it;
   but when its glory has passed through the soul the lips are still
   unable adequately to describe any of its features. God may loose the
   tongue so that it can shout and sing to the praise of eternal Love, but
   the intellect remains powerless.

   Before God created heaven and earth with all their inhabitants, the
   eternal Love of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit shone with unseen splendor
   in the divine Being. Love exists, not for the sake of the world, but
   for God's sake; and when the world came into existence, Love remained
   unchanged; and if every creature were to disappear, it would remain
   just as rich and glorious as ever. Love exists and works in the Eternal
   Being apart from the creature; and its radiation upon the, creature is
   but a feeble reflection of its being.

   Love is not God, but God is Love; and He is sufficient to Himself to
   love absolutely and forever. He has no need of the creature, and the
   exercise of His Love did not begin with the creature whom He could
   love, but it flows and springs eternally in the Love-life of the Triune
   God. God is Love; its perfection, divine beauty, real dimensions, and
   holiness are not found in men, not even in the best of God's children,
   but scintillate only around the Throne of God.

   The unity of Love with the Confession of the Trinity is the
   starting-point from which we proceed to base Love independently in God,
   absolutely independent of the creature or anything creaturely. This is
   not to make the divine Trinity a philosophic deduction from essential
   love. That is unlawful; if God had not revealed this mystery in His
   Word we should be totally ignorant of it. But since the Scripture puts
   the Triune Being before us as the Object of our adoration, and upon
   almost every page most highly exalts the mutual Love of Father, Son,
   and Holy Spirit, and delineates it as an Eternal Love, we know and
   plainly see that this holy Love may never be represented but as
   springing from the mutual love of the divine Persons.

   Hence through the mystery of the Trinity, the Love which is in God and
   is God obtains its independent existence, apart from the creature,
   independent of the emotions of mind and heart; and it rises as a sun,
   with its own fire and rays, outside of man, in God, in whom it rests
   and from whom it radiates.

   In this way we eradicate every comparison of the Love of God with our
   love. In this way the false mingling ceases. In principle we resist the
   reversing of positions whereby arrogant man had succeeded in copying
   from himself a so-called God of Love, and into silencing all adoration.
   In this way the soul returns to the blessed confession that God is
   Love, and the way of divine mercy and pity is opened whereby the
   brightness of that Sun can radiate in a human way, i.e., in a finite
   and imperfect manner to and in the human heart, to the praise of God.

  The Manifestation of Holy Love.

   "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us." --1 John
   iv. 16.

   The question which now presents itself is: In what way is the divine,
   majestic act of making man a partaker of true love accomplished? We
   answer that this is--

   1. Prepared by the Father in Creation.

   2. Made possible by the Son in Redemption.

   3. Effectually accomplished by the Holy Spirit in Sanctification.

   There is in this respect, first a work of the Father, which the
   Heidelberg Catechism designates, "Of God the Father and our Creation,"
   following the example of St. Paul, who wrote: "But to us there is but
   one God the Father, of whom are all things" (1 Cor. viii. 6). By this
   we do not mean to deny that God the Father works also in redemption and
   in sanctification, for all the outgoing works of God belong to the
   three Persons. We only wish to indicate that seeking for the origin of
   things, one can not stop at the Holy Spirit, for He proceedeth from the
   Son and the Father; nor at the Son, for He is generated by the Father;
   but at the Father, for He neither proceedeth from any one, nor is He
   generated.

   In this Scriptural sense we say, that the work of making man a partaker
   of Love is prepared by the Father in creation.

   For every exercise of love, both in man and animal, finds its ground in
   creation. In the animal God created instinctive love directly; in the
   man He created love by making all men of one blood, by ordaining
   husband and wife to be each other's helpmeets, and by creating in the
   blood itself that wonderful attraction of the one to the other.

   Moreover, He also implanted in man's consciousness the sense of love.
   The animal loves, but without knowing it. On the contrary, not only
   does man feel the impulse of love, but this impulse is also reflected
   in the mirror of his soul wherein he beholds the beauty of love; thus
   he learns to cherish love and to rise to the act of loving with full
   consciousness.

   Finally, by His providence, which is but an effect of creation, the
   Father ordains that man should meet man, come into contact with man,
   that in this way the sense of love may become active in him. For
   whether it be a poor sufferer whose distress arouses my love, or a bold
   character that appeals to my sympathy; or lastly a pure and beautiful
   figure that attracts me irresistibly, it is always God the Father who
   allots me these meetings, who by His providential leadings makes the
   kindling of love possible.

   This is followed, in the second place, by the work of the Son, who
   became flesh to reveal to us the fulness of divine Love in the flesh.
   Hence the manifestation of Love in the redemptive work.

   This is entirely different from what the Father did in creation; for,
   altho in creation divine love was foreshadowed, its conception
   implanted, and its imperfect exercise made possible, yet the divine
   Love itself was not revealed. But it is revealed in the advent of the
   Son: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son,
   that whosoever believeth on Him might not perish, but have everlasting
   life" (John iii. 16); "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that
   He loved us, and gave us His son to be a propitiation for our sins."
   ((1 John iv. 10) This is the "Peace an earth, good will toward men"
   (Luke ii. 14) of which the angels sang in the fields of Bethlehem; this
   is the mystery that the angels desire to look into.

   Here we notice again two things:

   First, the Love wherewith God loved the world proven by the fact that
   he spares not His own Son, but delivers Him up for us all.

   Second, the love of Christ for the Father, whose work He finished, and
   for us, whom He saved.

   The second is of greatest importance to us. In Christ, whom we honor as
   God manifest in the flesh, the divine Love is seen; in Him it appeared
   and scintillated with all-surpassing, brightness. The reality of the
   divine Love appeared to men for the first time and once for all in Him:
   "That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we
   have looked upon and our hands have handled, declare we unto you" (1
   John i. 1-3); and that was always the glory of the eternal Love which
   had captivated and pervaded their whole soul.

   Until now men had walked in Love's shadow, but in Immanuel Love itself
   appeared in the flesh and after the manner of men. It was not merely a
   radiation of Love, its reflection, an increated feature, sense, or
   inclination, but the fresh, irresistible waves of Love's own
   constraining power issuing from the depths of His divine heart. It was
   this Love which, in the heart of Immanuel, brought heaven down to
   earth, and which by His ascension to heaven uplifted our world to the
   halls of eternal light. Even tho Europe had felt nothing of it, and
   America had never thought of a Savior, tho Africa had not heard the
   tidings, and it was but a small spot in Asia where His feet pressed the
   ground, yet it was the heart of Immanuel that bound every continent and
   the world--yea, the very universe around it, to the divine Mercy.

   That Love shone forth as a love for an enemy. Man had become the enemy
   of God: "There is none that doeth good, no not one." (Psalm xiv. 3;
   liii. 3; Rom. iii. 12) The creature hated God. The enmity was absolute
   and terrible. There was nothing in man to attract God; rather
   everything to repel Him. And when all was enmity and repulsion, then
   the Love of God was made manifest in that Christ died for us when we
   were enemies.

   Love among men and animals rests upon mutual attraction, sympathy, and
   inclination; even the love that relieves the sufferer feels the power
   of it. But here is a love that finds no attraction anywhere, but
   repulsion everywhere. And in this fact sparkles the sovereign liberty
   of divine Love: it loves because it will love, and by loving saves the
   object of its love.

   Since this Love attained its severest tension on Calvary, its symbol is
   and ever shall be the Cross. For the Cross is the most fearful
   manifestation of man's enmity; and by the very contrast the beauty and
   adorableness of divine Love shine most gloriously: Love that suffers
   and bears everything, Love that can die voluntarily, and in that death
   heralds the dawn of a still more glorious future.

   But even the work of the Son does not finish the work of putting the
   impress of God's Love upon the human heart. Wherefore as the Creation
   is followed by the Incarnation, so does Pentecost follow the
   Incarnation; and it is God the Holy Spirit who accomplishes this third
   work by His descent into the heart of man.

   "It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the
   Comforter will not come unto you." (John xvi. 7) This implies that the
   Holy Ghost would give the disciples still a higher good than the Son
   could give them. This is not independently of the Son; for the
   Scripture teaches emphatically that He neither will nor can do anything
   without the Son, and that He receives of the Son only to give unto us.
   However, the difference remains that, altho Jesus suffers and dies and
   rises again for us, nevertheless the actual work in the souls of men
   awaits the gracious operation of the Holy Spirit. It is, as St. Paul
   writes to the Romans, that "the Love of God is shed abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost." (Rom. v. 5)

   And this is the proper work of the Holy Spirit, that shall remain His
   forevermore. When there remains no more sin to be atoned for, nor any
   unholiness to be sanctified, when all the elect shall jubilate before
   the throne, even then the Holy Spirit shall perform this divine work of
   keeping the Love of God actively dwelling in their hearts. How, we can
   not tell; but this we understand, that it is the Holy Spirit who, being
   the same in all, unites all souls in blessed union. When at the same
   moment spiritual life is wrought in your soul and mine and in the souls
   of others, the mutual bond of Love must be the result. For, altho men
   and things are grounded in the Father, and the souls of the redeemed
   are united in the Son, yet personally to enter into every soul, making
   it His temple and dwelling-place, is the work of the Holy Spirit.

   Hence it is the same Spirit who as God enters the heart of every one of
   the redeemed, and as God performs and perfects His work in every heart
   irresistibly. And, tho different circumstances and manifold sins have
   caused differences of opinion among the persons in whom the same Holy
   Spirit has been at work, so that at times they have held strongly
   opposite views, yet the fact of their inward union remains, which by
   the working and indwelling of the Holy Spirit in their hearts is made a
   real and even indissoluble union.

   This may not always come to the surface, but inwardly the matter is all
   the more real and glorious. Moreover, the Holy Spirit is always
   actively at work to remove every outward obstacle. And if this is not
   altogether a success before we die, there is no need of fear so long as
   in death the scales shall, as it were, fall from our eyes, and Love
   shall conquer. Compared to eternity, life on earth is but a moment.
   Hence it may not be denied that the bond of union, the intertwining and
   interlacing that must bind the children of God together in the divine
   fire of Love, is, by the working and indwelling of the self-same
   Spirit, a real fact. It is the self-same Holy Spirit who, dwelling in
   every heart, directs them altogether to one end, who, consecrating
   every soul to be His tabernacle, in that He is God and therefore Love,
   brings it about that, in and through and with Himself, the Love of God
   is shed abroad in every heart. Think of Him as banished from their
   souls, and the Love of God has fled from their hearts; but let every
   grace be concealed and slumbering, let the outward appearance deny the
   inward grace, so long as we are assured that the Holy Spirit dwells in
   our hearts we may rest assured that even the Love of God dwells in us.

   Moreover, the Holy Spirit is not a Stranger in our hearts, but
   penetrates our deepest selfhood and brings to each of us a gift, a
   word, a consolation peculiarly adapted to our individual need. Of
   course this is a much varied work; but, despite its multiformity, it is
   not a pieced work without inward connection, but an executing of the
   plan of the Father in accordance with the eternal counsel. Wherefore,
   however delicate its nature may be, it is always aiming at that pure
   and perfect harmony which in God's counsel is prepared not only for
   every one of the redeemed, but for the whole house of God, and the body
   of Christ in all its proportions.

   As the selfsame Spirit, He not only works in all, uniting all, but,
   since He proceeds from Father and Son, He also arranges and directs His
   work in one soul with regard to that in another, so that the
   interlacing and welding together of the souls of the saints must be the
   result. When according to the same glorious plan one Worker works in
   all, then every wall of separation must fall; Love must prevail, and
   all its sweet and blessed influence be felt:, not as something that
   proceeds from ourselves and belongs to us, but as a Love even foreign
   to us which coming from God penetrates and refreshes the soul; not the
   mere ideal of enthusiasts, but a divine power that masters and
   overcomes us; not an abstract conception merely charming us, but the
   Holy Spirit whom we feel and discover in the soul as Love; a warm,
   full, blessed outpouring of Love that is stronger than death and that
   many waters can not quench.

  God the Holy Spirit the Love which Dwells in the Heart.

   "It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the
   beard, even Aaron's beard; that went down to the skirts of his
   garments." --Psalm cxxxiii. 2.

   The fact that love can radiate within man does not insure him the
   possession of true and real Love, unless, according to His eternal
   counsel, God is pleased to enter into personal fellowship with him. So
   long as man knows Him only from afar and not near, God is a stranger to
   him. He may admire His Love, have a faint sense of it, be pleasantly
   affected by it, and even rejoice to see others drink from its Fountain,
   yet never come a step nearer to it. In God's hand he may be the means
   of showing others the way to it, without knowing it by personal
   experience.

   The true Love is one with and inseparable from God. It may radiate its
   brightness even in the animal, but Love itself can not enter the heart
   except God come first. And God's elect have the royal privilege of
   calling this gift their own. All their wealth and treasure consist in
   the fact that from the hand of their Lord they have received this gold
   tried in the fire.

   Not, however, as tho this love, wholly possessing them, shall
   henceforth be of all their actions the only impulse. From St. Paul we
   learn that, while the Love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
   Holy Ghost, much evil may be found among us; wherefore we are
   admonished to exercise patience and self-denial. But tho, like faith,
   Love may be in the germ and nothing be visible on the surface, in the
   warm soil, germ-like, it may swell, sprout, and strike out its roots in
   the ground. Hence, however defective and incomplete its form, Love
   itself dwells in our hearts; and by our own experience we are conscious
   of it. Who of God's children does not recall the blessed moments when
   this Love fell upon the soul as mild dew drops upon the thirsty leaf,
   filling him with a felicity unknown heretofore? This blessed experience
   was heavenly and supernatural. The soul actually felt the everlasting
   arms underneath, and acknowledged that God is good and essentially
   Love. It is true the divine Majesty as it were consumed the soul, but
   at the same time it uplifted and glorified it. The soul realized that
   it was surrounded by Love, uplifted above the low plain of vanity, and,
   more blessed still, that it had received power to embrace God with the
   arms of its own love. It is true this does not last. The evening star
   of hope is followed again and again by the dawn of the common,
   every-day life; but by that experience we have seen the heavens opened,
   the sign of Eternal Love descending, and, heard the music of its voice
   saying: "Behold your God."

   Hence these two must always go together: (1) Love shed abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost, and (2) the glad tidings that our God has
   come to us. And these are one and the same, for, as we have seen
   before, when the Eternal One comes to dwell with man, it is not the
   Father, nor the Son, but the Holy Spirit whose office is to enter into
   man's spirit and to establish the most intimate relation between him
   and God. The Father and the Son will also come to dwell with him; the
   Son is even said to stand at the door and knock waiting to be admitted;
   but both, Father and Son do this through the Holy Spirit. These three
   are One: the Holy Spirit is in the creation, but only through His
   essential union with the Father and the Son. He is also in the
   redemptive work, for He is bound to the pleasure of the Father and the
   Incarnation of the Son. In like manner both the Father and the Son
   dwell in the saints, but only through the Holy Spirit.

   If witnessing of the Holy Spirit were only momentary, if He came to
   tarry only for a night, the blessed work of Love could not be wrought.
   And if He had to leave the saints in one part of the world to visit
   others in other parts, it would be altogether out of the question. But
   He is God, unlimited: in my closet He abides with me just as really as
   with thousands in all parts of the earth at the same time; and not only
   with the saints below, but in a higher sense in all the redeemed
   already arrived in the heavenly Jerusalem. As the sun shines brightly
   into your chamber, while it radiates light and heat upon millions in
   distant lands, so is the operation of the Holy Spirit not local and
   limited, but divinely omnipresent in you and me, tho neither knows the
   other's face nor yet has heard his name.

   For the Holy Spirit does not dwell in our hearts as we dwell in our
   house, independent of it, walking through it, shortly to leave it; but
   He so inheres in and cleaves to us that, tho we were thrown into the
   hottest crucible, He and we could not be separated. The fiercest fire
   could not dissolve the union. Even the body is called the temple of the
   Holy Spirit; and tho at death He may leave it at least in part, to
   bring it again in greater glory in the resurrection, yet as far as our
   inward man is concerned, He never departs from us. In that sense He
   abides with us forever.

   Distressed and overwhelmed by the sense of guilt and shame, we may cry
   with David: "Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me!" (Psalm li. 11) but His
   indwelling in our souls can not be destroyed. An ancient temple was
   remarkable for the fact that, altho visitors came and went, and
   successive generations brought their sacrifices to the altar, yet the
   same idol remained for ages standing behind that altar immovable and
   stedfast. St. Paul wrote about the temple of the Holy Spirit, not to
   the people of Jerusalem, but to the Corinthians; wherefore it is
   evident that he borrowed his image from the idol-temple in their city,
   and not from that of Jerusalem. He meant to say that, as the image of
   Diana dwelt in the temple of Corinth permanently and without being
   removed, so does the Holy Spirit dwell permanently and stedfastly in
   the souls of the called of God.

   David says of Love: "It is like the precious ointment upon the head,
   that ran down upon the beard, that went down to the skirts of his
   garments" (Psalm cxxxiii. 2),--a figure not very attractive for us who
   are unfamiliar with perfumed oils. But when you remember that the oil
   used for the anointing of the high priest was fragrant and volatile, so
   that when the precious bottle was opened it filled the whole house with
   its fragrance, you will appreciate the beauty of the figure; for when
   the golden oil is poured out upon the head and runs down the flowing
   robe of the high priest, its all-pervading fragrance is found the next
   morning in the trailing hem of the garment. The high priest, in his
   robes of office, is the image of the Church of the living God, and his
   head the image of Christ. The anointing oil represents the Holy Spirit,
   who, being poured out upon the head of Christ, flows down from Him upon
   all who belong to His glorious, mystical body; reaching down so far
   that even the least esteemed, who are but as the hem of His garment,
   are pervaded by the selfsame precious ointment.

   This beautiful figure illustrates the unity which, as the fruit of
   Love, is wrought by the selfsame Holy Spirit who in all ages, among all
   nations, in all tongues and languages, enters into the hearts of God's
   elect, abiding with them, planting Himself in them, never to leave
   them; who dwelling and working in all not according to His own choice,
   but according to the disposition of the members in the body of Christ,
   under Him as their glorious Head, has established the most blessed
   fellowship between that Head and the members; has entered every heart
   and penetrated to its deepest stratum; has united the whole assembly of
   the elect into one glorious, concordant whole, in perfect Love, now and
   forever.

   And this mighty fact, that the selfsame Holy Spirit dwells and works in
   all, is not only the prophecy of Love, but the, demonstration of the
   fact that Love exists, and that every disturbing element is but the
   dust that still covers the diamond, and the dross that prevents the
   glittering of the gold. God the Holy Spirit lives, is, and feels
   Himself One in all God's children; and altho each experiences this in
   his own way, and expresses it in his own tongue, it is One and the Same
   who comforts and works in them all.

   Hence the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, loves His own work which He
   works in others. The Holy Spirit in one, can not deny Himself in
   another. From this it follows that the indwelling of the same Holy
   Spirit in all not only guarantees a real and substantial unity for the
   future and for the present, whether visible or invisible, but the very
   fact itself causes the Love of God to be shed abroad in the hearts of
   the saints, since the Holy Spirit must always love Himself:

   If He merely hovered over the surface of the soul's life, this would
   not mean much; but there can be no stratum in the soul so low that He
   does not penetrate it. The fountain that He has opened in us pours
   forth from the spot where the first pulsations, the deepest motives and
   workings of the new man, originate. On the surface we may therefore
   cherish another love; but when, deceived and disappointed by that love,
   with contrite hearts we feel that the creature can not be trusted, then
   we find on the bottom of our own soul the same old, faithful, blessed,
   and divine Love by which the Holy Spirit comforts us and teaches us to
   comfort others. Even tho at times of indifference all may seem lost, we
   need not fear, for as soon as the foundations of the soul are uncovered
   the presence of that eternal Love manifests itself. Underneath, in the
   hidden, mystic life, lies the foundation of all love in the presence of
   the Holy Spirit.

   God is Love, and through the Holy Spirit Love dwells in all God's
   children; and these children united under their glorious Head in one
   body are one--one by the same new birth, by the same life, and the same
   Love; and, if it were possible at once to remove all earthly rubbish
   and pollution, we would see the sparkle of that Love in all and among
   all, beautiful and glorious.

  The Love of the Holy Spirit in Us.

   "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children
   together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye
   would not."--Matt. xxvii. 37.

   The Scripture teaches not only that the Holy Spirit dwells in us, and
   with Him Love, but also that He sheds abroad that Love in our hearts.

   This shedding abroad does not refer to the coming of the Holy Spirit's
   Person, for a person can not be shed abroad. He comes, takes
   possession, and dwells in us; but that which is shed abroad must
   consist of numberless particles. The verb "to pour out" (to shed
   abroad) is used primarily of water, grain, or fruit; i.e., of liquids
   or solids composed of parts or particles of one kind, passing from one
   vessel into another. In Scripture the verb is used metaphorically.
   Hannah said: "I have poured out my soul before the Lord" (1 Sam. i.
   15); the Psalmist: "Pour out your heart before Him" (Psalm lxii. 8);
   Isaiah: "They poured out a prayer before Him." (Isa. xxvi. 16) "To pour
   out," always signifies that the heart is filled to overflowing with so
   many complaints, cares, griefs, or distresses that it can no longer
   contain them, but pours them out before God or men in groans and
   prayers.

   With reference to God, we read that He poured out the fierceness of His
   anger upon His enemies; and again, "that He shall pour out the Spirit
   of prayer and supplication." In the first passage, the metaphor is
   borrowed from the hail-storm which overtakes the traveler and
   prostrates him. So shall the blows of divine wrath descend like hail
   upon the heads of its enemies and prostrate them. And in the second it
   is signified that with overwhelming power His people shall be
   constrained to prayer.

   In this latter sense, the Scripture frequently applies it to the advent
   of the Holy Spirit. Both prophets and apostles declare that the Lord
   shall pour out His Spirit upon all. Finally, we read that the Holy
   Spirit was poured out. But even here the primary meaning of the word
   must be retained, for by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit we
   understand the flowing down into our hearts, or into the Church, of a
   multitude of powers of the same kind that fill the emptiness of the
   soul.

   It may be objected--and this deserves careful consideration--that in
   this thought we contradict our former statement, that it is the Holy
   Spirit, the Third Person in the Trinity, who takes possession of the
   heart and, dwells therein; for we now say that it is, not the Person
   who comes in, but a working, an element, a power which is poured out.
   But, instead of being contradictory, these two are the same; only, by
   their mutual connection, they give us a more correct insight--and that
   is just what we need. When I carry a lighted lamp into a dark room, I
   enter as the light-bearer, while at the same moment the light is poured
   out in the room. These two should not be confounded. I am not poured
   out, but the light. I enter the room, but the light is carried into it.
   And this is exactly what the Holy Spirit does. When He enters the heart
   the brightness of His Person is poured out therein.

   It is true that in these cases the Holy Spirit is mentioned in a
   somewhat modified sense, but when we speak of the light the same is
   true. Of an approaching light we say, "There comes the light," altho we
   know that some one carries the light. At sunrise we say, "The sun is
   rising," altho it would be more correct to say: "The light of the sun
   is rising." In like manner the name of the Holy Spirit is used in
   Scripture in a twofold way: first, with reference to the Third Person
   in the Trinity; secondly, with reference to the heavenly brightness and
   blessed activity which He carries with Himself. And instead of being
   more or less incorrect, this two-fold use of the name is much more
   correct with reference to the Holy Spirit than when it refers to
   artificial light or to the sun. We should remember that there is a
   difference between the lamp and its radiating light; and that the
   immense body of the sun and its light are also two different things.
   But this is not so with reference to the Holy Spirit. There is no
   difference between Himself and His operations. We make the distinction
   to assist our representation, but in reality it has no existence. Where
   the Holy Spirit is, there He works; and where He works, there is the
   Holy Spirit. They are the same. The one is even unthinkable without the
   other.

   There is an advantage in the use of the metaphor "to pour out." It
   teaches that the dwelling of the Holy Spirit in the congregation of the
   elect is neither inactive, nor from compulsion keeping himself aloof
   from their persons; but that He can not come among them without pouring
   Himself out in them. And, dwelling in the elect, He does not slumber,
   nor does He keep an eternal Sabbath, in idleness shutting Himself up in
   their hearts; but as the divine Worker He seeks from within to fill
   their individual persons, pouring the stream of His divine brightness
   through every space.

   But we should not imagine that every believer is instantly filled and
   permeated with that brightness. On the contrary, the Holy Spirit finds
   him filled with all manner of evil and treachery. Iniquities are piled
   up on every side. Horrible sins rise from underneath. The consciousness
   of his bitter, spiritual misery harasses him. Moreover, his heart is
   divided by many walls and partitions. Even the brightest light can not
   penetrate the whole at once; and by far the greater part remains for
   the present at least in deepest darkness.

   From this it follows that, when the Holy Spirit has entered man's
   heart, His task is not ended, but only just begun--a task so difficult
   that the power of the Holy Spirit alone can perform it. His method of
   procedure is not with divine power to force a man as tho he were a
   stock or block, but by the power of love and compassion so to influence
   and energize the impulses of the feeble will that it feels the effect,
   is inclined, and finally consents to be the temple of the Holy Spirit.

   Being once firmly established, He gradually subjects the most hidden
   impulses and intentions of the saint's personality to the power of His
   Love, in order thus to prevail. For this end He uses at once the
   external means of the preached Word which penetrates the consciousness
   and takes hold of the person, and the internal operation of blessing
   the Word and making it effectual. This operation is different in each
   person. In one it proceeds with marvelous rapidity; in another,
   progress is exceedingly slow, being checked by serious reaction which
   in some rare cases is overcome only with the last breath. There are
   scarcely two men in whom this gracious operation is completely the
   same.

   It may not be denied that the Holy Spirit often meets serious
   opposition on the part of the saint: not from enmity, for he is an
   enemy no more, but because he is commanded to depart from sin, to
   renounce his idols, his sinful affections, the many things that seem
   indispensable to his joy and life, and especially when, pointing to the
   cross, the Holy Spirit imposes sacrifices, pursues him with
   afflictions, covers him with ignominy. Then that opposition can become
   so strong and grievous that one would almost say: "He is no more a
   child of God."

   And the Holy Spirit bears all this resistance with infinite pity, and
   overcomes it and casts it out with eternal mercy. Who that is not a
   stranger to his own heart does not remember how many years it took
   before he would yield a certain point of resistance; how he always
   avoided facing it; restlessly opposed it, at last thought to end the
   matter by arranging for a sort of modus vivendi between himself and the
   Holy Spirit? But the Holy Spirit did not cease, gave him no rest; again
   and again that familiar knock was heard, the calling in his heart of
   that familiar voice. And after years of resistance he could not but
   yield in the end; it became like fire in his bones, and he cried out:
   "Thou, Lord, art stronger than I; Thou hast prevailed."

   In this way the Holy Spirit breaks down every wall of partition,
   pouring out His light in all the heart's empty spaces, gradually
   opening every door, gaining access to the soul's most secret chambers,
   even to the vaults underneath the structure of our being, until
   finally, either before or in death, the outpouring of His brightness is
   complete in all our personality, and the whole heart has become His
   temple.

   This task is executed only by means of Love. The Holy Spirit allows
   Himself to be grieved, provoked, and insulted; but He never yields. He
   is never weary of repeating the same thing to the ear that once was
   deaf. In our past or present there can be no sin, however base, of
   which He does not comfort us, which He does not pardon. He gives
   healing balm for every inward wound. He always has a word in good
   season for all that are weary. It is Love always filling us with shame;
   but at the same time ever uplifting, never despairing, unceasing in its
   devotion.

   It is not merely a Love for men in general, but in the most exclusive
   sense a personal Love for the individual; not only Love for the
   redeemed taken as a multitude, but a Love individual, peculiarly tinted
   to meet the special peculiarity of our being. It is not only a pity for
   all who suffer, like that of the nurse for the patients of her ward,
   but Love that can not meet the need of any one else, but is for me
   personally just what it must and can not otherwise be.

   Hence the divine patience in winning thee. One might say:. "There are
   thousands of others whom He might take and influence with much less
   trouble perhaps." But that is not the question. With all the depth of
   His divine Love He sought thee personally. It is Love in the richest,
   purest, tenderest sense of the word.

   The Holy Spirit prevails by loving us, by proving His Love, by
   breathing Love, while, at the same time, His victory carries Love into
   our hearts. Allow Him to enter your soul, and He will carry Love
   therein, which imperceptibly imparts itself to your heart and
   inclination. We yield, not because we are compelled by superior power,
   but being drawn by Love, we are so affected that we can not resist it.

   And this is the glorious, divine, and beautiful art of which the Holy
   Spirit is the chief Artist. He alone understands it, and they whom He
   has taught. All other love is but a feeble shadow or faint imitation.
   Not until through Love the Holy Spirit has prevailed can Love enter our
   hearts, and then we, the formerly sinful and selfish, learn to
   appreciate Love.

  Love and the Comforter.

   "By the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned."--2 Cor. vi. 6.

   The question is, "In what sense is the pouring out of Love an
   ever-continued, never-finished work?

   Love is here taken in its highest, purest sense. Love which gives its
   goods to the poor and its body to be burned is out of the question. St.
   Paul declares that one may do these things and still be nothing more
   than a sounding brass, utterly devoid of the least spark of the true
   and real Love.

   In 2 Cor. vi. 6 the apostle mentions the motives of his zeal for the
   cause of Christ; and it is remarkable that among them he mentions these
   three, in the following order: "By goodness, by the Holy Ghost, by love
   unfeigned." Goodness indicates general benevolence and readiness to
   sacrifice; of these we find among worldly men many examples that make
   us ashamed. Then comes the stimulating and animating influences of the
   Holy Spirit; lastly, Love unfeigned which is the true, real, and divine
   Love.

   In his hymn of eternal Love the apostle gives us an exquisite
   delineation of this "Love unfeigned;" which shall not cease to command
   the admiration of the saints on earth as long as taste for heavenly
   melodies shall dwell in their hearts:

   "Love suffereth long and is kind; Love envieth not; Love vaunted not
   itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not
   her own; is not easily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in
   iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all
   things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love never faileth . .
   . . For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face; now I
   know in part, but then I shall know even as also I am known. And now
   abideth faith, hope, and love, these three; but the greatest of these
   is Love." ( 1 Cor. xiii. 4-8, 12-13)

   This teaches how the Holy Spirit performs His work of Love. And so,
   says the apostle, must the fruit of His work be in our hearts. Very
   well; if such is the glorious fruit of His work and men know the tree
   by its fruit, may we not conclude that this is but the description of
   His own work of Love?

   The means employed by the Holy Spirit in the shedding abroad of the
   Love of God in our hearts is simply Love. By loving us He teaches love.
   By applying love to us, by expending love upon us, He inculcates love
   on us. It is the Love of the Holy Spirit whereby the shedding abroad of
   love in our hearts has become possible. As, according to 1 Cor. xiii.,
   Love ought to manifest itself in our lives, so has the Holy Spirit
   wrought it in our hearts. With endless longsuffering and touching
   kindness He sought to win us. Of the love which we gave to the Father
   and the Son He was never envious, but rejoiced in it. His Love never
   made a display of us by leading us into unendurable temptations. It
   never impressed us as being self-seeking, but always as ministering
   love. It ever accommodated itself to the needs and conditions of our
   hearts. However much grieved, it was never provoked. It never
   misunderstood or suspected us, but ever stimulated us to new hope.
   Wherefore it rejoiced not in iniquity to sanctify it, but when the
   truth prevailed in us. And when we had strayed and done wrong, it
   covered the wrong whispering in our ear that it still believed and
   hoped all good things of us. Wherefore it endured in us all evil, all
   unloveliness, all contradictions. It failed us not as a lamp that goes
   out in the dark. The Love of the Holy Spirit never faileth. And while
   we enjoy here all its sweetness and tenderness, it prophesies that only
   hereafter it will manifest the fulness of its brightness and glory, for
   on earth it is only known in part. Its perfect bliss shall appear only
   when, looking no more by means of the glass at the phenomenal, we shall
   behold the eternal verities. For whatever may fail, being among all our
   spiritual blessings the highest, the richest, and therefore the
   greatest, Love shall abide forever.

   In this way we begin to understand something of Comfort. Christ calls
   the Holy Spirit the "Comforter." He says: "I will send you another
   Comforter, and He will abide with you forever." (John xiv. 16)

   This does not refer to the "only comfort in life and death," for that
   consists in "that I am not my own, but belong unto my faithful Savior
   Jesus Christ" (Heid. Cat., q. 1). Christ speaks, not of comfort, but of
   the Comforter. Not a thing, an event, or a fact, such as the paying of
   the ransom of Calvary, but of a Person, who by His personal appearance
   actually comes to comfort us. Overwhelmed by distress and sorrow, we
   have not lost the comfort, for nothing can come to us without the will
   of our heavenly Father; but we may have lost the Comforter. It is one
   thing to be watching by the bedside of my sick child, and to remember
   that even this affliction may be to God's glory and a blessing to the
   child; and quite another when a faithful parent enters the room, and
   seeing my tears wipes them away; reading my sorrow seeks to drive it
   from my heart; with the warmth of his love cherishing me in the
   coldness of my desolation; and leaning my head against his breast looks
   me hopefully in the eye; and smoothing my brow, with holy animation,
   points me to heaven, inspiring me with trust in my heavenly Father:

   Comfort is a deposited treasure from which I can borrow; it is like the
   sacrifice of Christ in whom is all my comfort, because, on Calvary He
   opened to all the house of Israel a fountain for sin and uncleanness.
   But a comforter is a person, who, when I can not go to the fountain nor
   even see it, goes for me and fills his pitcher and puts the refreshing
   drops to my burning lips. When Ishmael lay perishing with thirst, his
   mother's comfort was near by, in the cleft of the rock from which the
   water came gushing down; yet with comfort so near he might have died.
   But when the angel of the Lord appeared and showed her the water, then
   Hagar had found her Comforter.

   And such is the Holy Spirit. So long as Jesus walked on earth He was
   the Comforter of His disciple's. He lifted them when they stumbled;
   when discouraged and distressed by fear and doubt, He was their
   faithful Savior and Comforter. But Himself was not comforted. When in
   Gethsemane, being exceedingly sorrowful even unto death, He asked them
   for comfort, they could not give it to Him. They were powerless; they
   slept and could not watch with Him one hour. So He struggled alone,
   uncomforted and comfortless, until an angel came and did what sinners
   could not do, comforting the Savior in His distress.

   When about to depart from the earth, Jesus foreknew how desolate His
   disciples would be. They were weak, helpless, broken reeds. As the
   slender vine clings to the oak, so they cling to their Lord. And now,
   as the tree was to be removed and the vines would lie on the ground a
   tangled mass, they needed to be comforted as one whom his mother
   comforts. And were they now to be left as orphans, since He who had
   comforted them even more tenderly than a mother was to go away? And
   Jesus answers: "No, I will not leave you orphans, I will send you
   another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever."

   Thus the deep meaning of Christ's word, that the Holy Spirit is our
   Comforter, naturally discloses itself. Of course, in, order to comfort
   us He must personally be with us. One can comfort only by means of
   love. It is the lifting of the too heavy cross from the shoulders, the
   constant whispering of loving words, the gathering of tears, the
   patient listening to the complaints of our affliction, the sympathizing
   with our suffering, the being oppressed with our distresses, the
   identification with our suffering person. Surely, even a gift can
   afford comfort; a letter from a distant land can cast a ray of hope
   into the troubled soul; but to comfort us in such a way that the burden
   falls from the shoulder, and the soul revives and loves, in its love
   expecting to rejoice--such comfort we can expect only from the living
   person who, coming to us with the key to our heart, cherishes us with
   the warmth of his own soul.

   And since no one else can always be with us, wholly enter into our
   sorrows, fully understand and comfort us with infinite love, therefore
   is the Holy Spirit the Comforter. He abides with us forever, enters the
   deep places of every soul, listens to every throb of the heart, is able
   to relieve us of all our cares, takes all our troubles upon Himself,
   and by His tender and divinely loving words and sweet communion raises
   us out of our comfortless condition.

   This glorious work of the Holy Spirit must be studied with extreme
   carefulness.

   You can compare it, not to that of the artist who chisels a statue out
   of marble, but to that of the godly mother who with sacrificing love
   studies the characters of her children, watches over their souls while
   they themselves have no thought of it, nurses them in sickness, prays
   with them and for them so that they might learn to pray for themselves,
   bends a listening ear to their trifling griefs, and who in and through
   all this spends the energy of her soul with warnings and admonitions,
   now chiding, then caressing, to draw their souls to God.

   And yet, even this is no comparison; for all the sacrifices of the
   godliest mother, and all the comfort wherewith she comforts her
   children, are utterly nothing compared to the delightful and divine
   comfort of the Holy Spirit.

   Oh, that Comforter, the Holy Ghost, who never ceases to care for God's
   children, who ever resumes with new animation the weaving of their
   soul-garments, even tho their wilfulness has broken the threads! On
   earth there is no suitable comparison for it. In the human life there
   may be a type somewhere; but a full-sized image to measure this divine
   comfort there is not. It is wholly unique, wholly divine, the measure
   of all other comfort. The comfort wherewith we comfort others has value
   and significance only when it is bright with the spark, of the divine
   comfort.

   The Song of Songs contains a description of the tender love of Immanuel
   for His Church: He, the Bridegroom who calls for the bride; she, the
   bride who pines with love for her God-given Bridegroom. This is,
   therefore, something entirely different: the love, not of comfort, but
   of the tenderest, most intimate communion and mutual belonging
   together; the one not happy without the other; both destined for each
   other; by the divine ordinance united, and by virtue of that same
   ordinance wretched unless the one possesses the other. Such is not the
   Holy Spirit's love in the comforting. The communion of Christ and the
   Church is for time and eternity; but, the comfort of the Holy Ghost
   will cease--not His work of love, but that of the comforting. Comfort
   can be administered only so long as there is one uncomforted and
   comfortless. So long as Israel must pray to be delivered from
   iniquities; so long as tears flow; so long as there is bitter sorrow
   and distress,--so long will the Holy Spirit be our Comforter.

   But when sin is ended and misery is no more, when death is abolished
   and the last sorrow is endured and the last tear wiped away, then, I
   ask, what remains there for the Holy Spirit to comfort? How could there
   still be room for a Comforter?

   To the question, Why, then, did the Lord say, "I will send you another
   Comforter, that He may abide with you forever"? (John xiv. 16) I answer
   with another question: Is it to the honor of a child that, while he
   cries for his mother's comfort, he forgets her as soon as the sorrow is
   past? This can not be; this would be a denial of the nature of love. He
   that is truly comforted entertains for his comforter such intense
   feeling of gratitude, obligation, and attachment that he can not be
   silent, but after having enjoyed the comfort craves also the sweetness
   of love. The same is true regarding the Holy Spirit. When He shall have
   comforted us from our last distress, and removed us from sorrow
   forever, then we can not say, "O Holy Spirit, now Thou mayest depart in
   peace"; but, we shall be constrained to cry, "Oh, refresh and enrich us
   now with Thy Love forever?"

   This would not be so if sin still dwelled in us; for sin makes one so
   unthankful and self-sufficient that after having tasted the comfort he
   can forget the Comforter. But among the blessed there is no
   ingratitude; but from deep inward compulsion we shall love and laud Him
   who, with captivating love, has divinely comforted us.

   Hence a Comforter who is to depart after having comforted us can not be
   the Comforter of God's children. Wherefore Jesus assured His disciples:
   "I will not leave you comfortless. I will send you another Comforter,
   that He may abide with you forever."

  The Greatest of These Is Love.

   "The greatest of these is Love."-- 1 Cor. xiii. 13.

   That the shedding abroad of Love and the glowing of its fire through
   the heart is the eternal work of the Holy Spirit, is stated by no one
   so pithily as by St. Paul in the closing verse of his hymn of Love.
   Faith, Hope, and Love are God's most precious gifts; but Love far
   surpasses the others in preciousness. Compared with all heavenly gifts,
   Faith, Hope, and Love stand highest, but of these three Love is the
   greatest. All spiritual gifts are precious, and with holy jealousy the
   apostle covets them, especially the gift of prophesying; but, among the
   various paths of obtaining spiritual gifts, he knows a way still more
   excellent, viz., the royal road of Love.

   We know that some deny us the right thus to interpret the thirteenth
   verse; but with little effect. To assert that in the heavenly life
   faith and hope, like Love, will abide forever, opposes the general
   teaching of the Scripture, and especially of St. Paul's course of
   reasoning. In his Epistle to the Corinthians, he opposes faith to
   sight, saying, "We walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Cor. v. 7);
   wherefore he can not mean that after all faith shall continue when
   turned into sight. If faith is the evidence of things not seen, how can
   it continue when we shall see face to face? How is it possible to
   maintain that St. Paul represents faith as an eternal gift when in the
   twelfth verse he says, "Then we shall know even as we are known" (1
   Cor. xiii. 12)? And he makes the same representation with reference to
   hope, "For we are saved by hope," adding, "Hope which is seen is no
   hope, for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for?" (Rom. viii. 24).
   Wherefore faith and hope can not be represented as abiding and enduring
   elements in our spiritual treasure. Neither faith nor hope belongs to
   the inheritance bequeathed to us by testament. They are springs of
   spiritual life and joy to us now, because we do not yet possess the
   inheritance; but when once the inheritance is ours, why should we still
   care for the will? As proof and earnest that the inheritance can not be
   lost, the will is very precious to us; but when the inheritance is
   delivered into our hands it is mere waste paper, and only the
   inheritance is of value.

   Even Drs. Beets and Van Oosterzee, altho they choose to walk in paths
   somewhat different from those of the fathers, fully concede this point,
   as their beautiful comments on the last verse of 2 Cor. xiii. plainly
   show. Dr. Beets writes:

     "Without apparent cause, at the end of a digression upon the
     excellency of love, the apostle mentions faith and hope before love.
     It is evident that, while thinking of the latter, he can not
     overlook the former. May we not infer from this that faith and hope
     are just as essential to the Christian as love? A Christian without
     love! It is indeed a contradiction of terms. The apostle says: He
     that hath not love is nothing.' How could he be a Christian? Ah,
     what deception, what hypocrisy, what horrible sin to disguise a life
     without love, a loveless heart under the Christian name! But what do
     you think of a Christian without hope? Is not this just as absurd
     and just as offensive? What! Life and immortality brought to light
     by Jesus Christ; He the Resurrection and the Life, having the words
     of eternal life; His Evangel the glad tidings of the forgiveness of
     sin, of reconciliation to God, of an opened heaven of bliss; and
     still it is thought possible that amid present suffering and sorrow
     a Christian can live without the delightful prospect and expectation
     of such a glorious future! Without hope! Is this not a fatal feature
     in the apostle's sad picture of the blind heathen? Is it not the
     same as to be without Christ? without God? Surely without Christ no
     man can know this hope, and no one who knows Christ can be without
     it:

     "And again, can one be a Christian without faith in God, who so
     loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever
     believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life'?
     without faith in Christ who has said, Let not your heart be
     troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in Me'? without faith in
     that faithful and true word of the divine promise which centers in
     the fact that Jesus Christ has come into the world to save sinners?
     a Christian without faith--I do not say power of faith by which he
     can remove mountains, but without faith which is the evidence of
     things not seen? Reader, if perhaps you are such a Christian, what
     is your Christianity? What profit is it to you? With what right,
     with what conscience, with what purpose do you persist in claiming
     the name of a Christian? A Christian without faith is one without
     hope; and as such he is a mortal, a sinner without comfort in life
     and death.

     "Perhaps some one will answer: Even as such my Christianity may be a
     great deal to me, and serve me the highest and best purpose, if it
     only cause me to go on to love. Even tho I had faith so that I could
     move mountains, and had not love, I would be nothing. Only through
     love one is something, is much, is all. Having, love, I have enough;
     and having Love, I can not be altogether without hope. These three
     being equally indispensable, they are equally inseparable from the
     Christian. No Christian without faith, without hope, without love.
     No Christian hope nor Christian love without Christian faith. And,
     on the other hand, no Christian faith without Christian hope; nor
     Christian faith without Christian love. Faith, Hope, Love, these
     three originate the one in the other; sustain each other; these
     three are one. They become one more and more; they strengthen,
     purify, regenerate each other. Love is not first, nor hope, but
     faith. However, faith is impossible, even for a moment, without hope
     and love.

     "But among these three, that are indispensable to the Christian and
     absolutely so to each other, love is the greatest and most excellent
     of all:

     "First, because of its importance to the Christian. Faith is the
     inward salvation, and hope the new-born happiness of a fallen man;
     but love is the growing perfection of restored man.

     "Second, because of its relation to God. Of faith and hope God is
     the Object and Example. To believe in God is to cast oneself in the
     arms of God; to hope is to rest upon His heart; but, to love is to
     bear His image. His own Being is Love. To love is divine. God is
     Love, and he that abideth in love abideth in Him and He in him.

     "Third, love is greatest by its working. Of the deeply rooted tree
     of faith, it is the fruit which glorifies God and the shadow which
     diffuses a blessing. By love all that believe are one; by it they
     strengthen, serve, and bear each other. Love edifieth.' It builds up
     the Body of the Lord; it spreads His Church among a sinful race, and
     carries on the labor of His love. For love's sake His Church, His
     Cross, His Person find grace and honor in the sight of unbelievers.
     It shames unbelief and silences mockery.

     "Fourth, love is greatest by reason of its endurance; Love never
     faileth. When time is merged in eternity, prophecy shall be silent.
     When the redeemed of all nations shall join in the song of the Lamb,
     tongues shall cease; and knowledge which is in part shall vanish
     away when that which is perfect is come. And when all is sight there
     shall be no more room for faith; and where shall hope be when all
     shall be fulfilled?

     "Lastly, love never faileth. When this corruptible shall have put on
     incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality; when it
     shall be revealed to us what we shall be; when bowed down in
     adoration we shall see Him as He is, in whom, tho not seeing Him,
     yet believing, we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,
     then shall our whole being, all our faith and hope, be only love.
     Then love, purified of her last stain and having attained to her
     highest truth, shall forever be in us the inexhaustible source of
     happiness and inexhaustible power of God glorifying activity. Only
     then shall we realize perfectly, that is forever, what it means to
     love, and also how little they have known of love who, denying the
     love of God in Christ, counted the exercise of holy love consistent
     with the persevering in blasphemous unbelief."

   And Dr. Van Oosterzee has written with no less animation:

     "They are noble companions even when we consider each by herself:
     Faith, not merely a certain confidence of the soul in the reality of
     things invisible, and in the certainty of the revelation of God in
     Christ Jesus, but that saving faith which builds upon the Person and
     work of the Redeemer; which enters into closest communion with Him;
     Hope of the perfect fulfilment of all the promises of God which are
     yea and amen in Christ Jesus; and Love which unites the believer,
     not only with God and Christ, but with all his brethren and sisters
     in the Lord, and with the whole race which in heaven and earth is
     named after God.

     "Lovely picture: at the right, Faith embracing the saving Cross; at
     the left, Hope leaning upon the infallible anchor; and in the midst,
     Love holding in her hand the burning heart, her daily sacrifice
     consecrated to the God of Love. And yet, altho in representation
     they may be separated, in reality they can not be, being companions
     inseparable, not only from every Christian, but also from one
     another. For what is faith, without hope and love? A cold conviction
     of the understanding, but without quickening power in heart, and
     without ripened fruit in life. Without hope, faith could not once
     see heaven; but even if it could enter heaven without love, it would
     lose its highest felicity. And what is hope, without faith and love?
     At the most a vain delusion, followed by a painful awakening; a
     fragrant blossom soon to wither without once bearing fruit. And
     finally, what is love without hope and faith? Perhaps the welling up
     of the natural feeling; but by no means a spiritual, vital
     principle. If love does not believe, it must die; and if it does not
     hope as well as love, it must be a source of measureless suffering.

     "To separate one of these three sisters from the others is to write
     the death-sentence of the one, and to destroy the beauty of the
     others. Inseparably united, however, they deserve to be called
     companions in the fullest sense of the word. Faith is much, hope is
     more, and love is most. Faith unites us with God; hope lifts us up
     to God; but love makes us conformable to God, for God is Love. Faith
     is the child of humility, hope the offspring of persecution, but
     love the fruit of faith and hope together. By faith and hope we do
     in a certain sense seek ourselves; love alone makes us forget
     ourselves, working for the salvation of others. Faith kneels down in
     the closet, and hope, in holy ecstasy, sees the heavens opened; but
     love sends us thence back into the world to impart the treasure of
     comfort there received to others. Yea, of love, not of faith and
     hope, can it be said, that it never faileth. Faith is turned into
     sight and hope into enjoyment, for what a man seeth why doth he yet
     hope for? But even before the throne of God, love remains as young
     as when for the first time it was born in the heart. Even there the
     bond of perfection is at once the condition and the pledge of an
     infinite increase in holiness and blessedness; and, therefore, it is
     the greatest forever, both here and there, even tho its name has
     merely third place. To the Christian here these three are constant
     companions; whatever may change and vanish away, they can abide, for
     they are the unchangeable mark of every believer. They must abide,
     or our entire Christianity becomes a form without life. They will
     abide, for they are so sublimely divine and so truly human. Faith
     may have to wrestle with darkness, hope with doubt, love with
     resistance; but where Christ truly lives in the heart, they must
     abide forever."

   There are, of course, expressions in these passages for which these two
   divines alone are responsible; we mean to show only that these two men
   have strongly felt that Love's superiority of place and quality is
   principally conspicuous from the fact that, while faith and hope will
   finally cease, Love abides forever.

   Surely, faith and hope do not cease in the sense that other spiritual
   gifts cease. The word "temporal" has a twofold meaning. Temporal is the
   worm that dies and from which nothing remains. Temporal is the
   caterpillar that must die as a worm, but that rises beautiful again as
   a butterfly. The same is true of faith and hope, as compared with the
   spiritual gifts of speaking with tongues and healing the sick. The
   latter will fail altogether. They will completely disappear. They will
   vanish away, as St. Paul says in 1 Cor. xiii. 8. But the failing of
   faith and hope may not be taken in that sense. They fail only to rise
   again in the fuller, richer, and more beautiful form of sight and
   enjoyment.

   But Love does not know this metamorphosis. It not only abides forever,
   but it ever abides unchanged. In the fact that all other gifts perish
   or change, and that Love alone is eternal, we see the never-ending work
   of the Holy Spirit scintillating in the hearts of believers; in our
   meditation on Love we apprehend His proper work in all its depths, even
   to the root.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Love in the Blessed Ones.

   "That God may be all in all."-- 1 Cor. xv. 28.

   Sanctification and the shedding abroad of love are not the same. Before
   the fall Adam could not have been the subject of a single act of
   sanctification, for he was holy; but Love could have been shed abroad
   in his heart ever more richly, fully, and abundantly. And this would
   have been the work of the Holy Spirit.

   The unholy alone need sanctification; but to suppose that Love is
   exhausted in the victory over selfishness is a great mistake. Of
   course, selfishness is utterly inconsistent with Love; but Love is not
   the mere absence of selfishness, as in Adam; nor its rebuke and
   blood-bought victory in the saint; in fact, Love begins to unfold and
   develop only after the last traces of selfishness are wholly effaced.

   The same is true of health, which is not merely the throwing off of
   disease and its subtle poison; for then convalescents alone could be
   called healthy, and real healthful life and the life of health would be
   out of the question. On the contrary, health exists independent of
   sickness, antedates it, and drives it out when it invades the system;
   for this is one of its essential operations. And after its fight with
   sickness it goes on more richly and exuberantly, as tho there had been
   no sickness at all, developing powers and offering enjoyments that are
   ever new and glorious. So does Love antedate selfishness. And when
   selfishness appeared, Love immediately prepared to drive it out. And
   having succeeded, its work was not ended, but as tho nothing had
   happened it continued its life of Love.

   Victory over an invading enemy does not end the national existence, but
   the nation's development and prosperity quietly and gratefully
   continue. Satan invaded Paradise, Love's dwelling-place, and with all
   his evil powers of selfishness opposed Love. Then Love had to fight,
   not because it was in its nature, but in self-defense. Indeed, it may
   not cease to fight until all selfishness is under perfect control. And
   when Love's rule is safe, Love does not recline in everlasting slumber,
   but with strong impulse and holy animation continues the unfolding of
   its holy and restful life.

   This fight is not fought in every heart separately. The fact that Satan
   is the author and inspirer of all selfishness proves the mutual
   relation of selfishness in every heart. To some extent even selfishness
   is organized. Hence victory over individual selfishness does not avail
   so long as selfishness continues in others. The selfishness of one will
   necessarily affect the other, and Love can not celebrate its triumph.

   It is true, in death God cuts off all sin from our hearts; and so far
   as we are concerned selfishness is cast out. He who awakes in eternity
   with selfishness in his heart is on the way to hell. But altho God in
   death graciously draws the last threads of selfishness from the hearts
   of His elect, yet their warfare against selfishness is not ended. For
   even from heaven Christ wages war, until the hour when, as the true
   Michael, with all His angels He shall deliver the last blow upon Satan
   and his unholy demons. And if immediately after death the elect will
   enjoy with Immanuel the communion of Love, then of course they will
   engage with Him in the conflict against Satan and fight with Him day
   and night. No saint can see his Savior fight and remain neutral. Nay,
   the Love of God is so deep, stirring, and captivating that he can not
   but enter the conflict.

   How in heaven the redeemed partake of the conflict we do not know. When
   in times of war husbands, fathers, and sons go out to meet the foe,
   wives, mothers, and daughters stay at home and never see the
   battle-field, but nevertheless they are partakers of the conflict: in
   their hearts and prayers; by their letters of love inspiring the men in
   the field; with their own hands providing for their necessities; by
   nursing the wounded and dying; by honoring the returning heroes and
   those fallen in battle. Even on earth one can be engaged in the fight
   without moving a foot, wielding no weapon other than Love. This answers
   in some measure the question how in heaven the redeemed partake of the
   warfare with Michael against Satan: through the great Love in their
   hearts; and by anticipation they enjoy the fulfilment of the promise
   that with Immanuel they shall sit upon His throne.

   However, this condition is only provisional and will end with the dawn
   of that notable day when from heaven the cry will be heard, "It is
   done," as once it was heard from Calvary: "It is finished!" Then, the
   last enemy destroyed, all shall be subject to Christ. Then all
   selfishness, all unholiness ended, and all opposition to Love being
   vanquished, God's children shall enjoy an eternal and undisturbed
   existence in which Love shall reach its zenith; and this is, as the
   Scripture expresses it: "That God shall be all in all."

   "God all in all," considered in connection with the Spirit's work of
   shedding abroad the Love of God in the hearts of the saints, sheds new
   light upon the subject. If by His indwelling the Holy Spirit sheds
   abroad the Love of God in the hearts of the saints, and causes that
   Love like rivers of water to flow over the fields of their spiritual
   life; if this cultivating of Love is His most proper work, then this
   "God all in all " is at once flooded with light. For then it means no
   more nor less than that the Holy Ghost, having entered the last of the
   elect, shall dwell in the hearts of all the saints; shall have pervaded
   the whole body of Christ in such completeness that selfishness shall
   not only be cast out, and even the conflict with selfishness be ended,
   but it shall not even be remembered, nor its possible return be feared.

   Altho "God all in all" has undoubtedly reference to Satan and the lost,
   for they shall forever abide under the anger of the Almighty and be
   consumed by His wrath; yet in its proper and full significance it
   refers only to the elect. In them alone He takes up His abode
   personally; in them alone He became something; in them alone He became
   gradually more and more; in them alone He became all. "In all,"
   referring to the number of the elect, signifies that in them, not
   individually, but collectively as the body of Christ, Love's triumph
   shall be complete.

   But even then the work of the Holy Spirit is not finished, but
   thenceforth shall continue forevermore. Then the heavenly felicity will
   only begin to unfold itself in a way wholly divine, and without the
   slightest impediment the Rose of Love will disclose its brilliant
   beauty. When, as a bridegroom coming forth from his chamber, the sun
   rises from the womb of the morning and causes his golden rays to
   wrestle with the dark clouds of the parting night, till, having
   scattered all, he stands forth magnificent conqueror in the deep azure
   of a cloudless sky, his splendor does not then decline with the last
   vanishing vapors, but only begins to shine out in greater brightness
   and power. And the same is true of the Sun of Love. He first fights and
   wrestles to vanquish the resistance of the darkened clouds and vapors
   of selfishness; and only gradually, after what has seemed an endless
   conflict, He succeeds in scattering and in driving them away before the
   splendor of His brightness. But when the victory is His, and the Sun of
   Love stands at last in dazzling glory in the cloudless sky, then, and
   only then, does He begin to show His perfect beauty and to radiate His
   blessed, cherishing rays.

   After the day of judgment the Holy Spirit can not cease to feed,
   cultivate, and strengthen the Love of God in the elect; for, if but for
   a moment He should withdraw from them, they would cease to be His
   children, and the body of Christ would lose the bond which binds it to
   its sacred Head.

   God's elect do not exist without the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. We
   derive all that we are not from ourselves, but from that rich Dweller
   in our hearts. We, His poor host, have nothing, and from our own
   treasury can produce not even a grain of love; but our rich Guest works
   in us with all His wealth. Or rather, not with His own, but with the
   riches of Christ's cross-merits; and with lavish hands He spends these
   cross-merits upon the poor owner of the house, making him unspeakably
   rich. But He does this, not in such a way as to make the saint the
   possessor of an independent capital, to be spent without the Holy
   Spirit. Nay, it is the Holy Spirit who from moment to moment holds the
   lamp that radiates Love's brightness in the heart in His own hand.
   Hence, if after the judgment, the Holy Spirit should cease to work in,
   or depart from, the hearts of the saints, all their life, light, and
   love would at once be quenched. They are what they are by His
   indwelling, and Love can celebrate its triumph only by pervading their
   whole personality with His influences. And what is this, but that "God
   is all in all"; for by the Holy Spirit even the Father and the Son come
   to dwell in them.

   Owing to the many obstacles that now prevent Love's light and
   brightness from pervading them, this indwelling is very imperfect. Even
   in heaven it is more or less hindered, owing to the conflict of Christ
   and His people against Satan. But after the judgment, these internal
   hindrances and external conflicts being ended forever, the Holy
   Spirit's working shall penetrate from center to circumference and
   gloriously unfold the inward beauty of the body of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXV.

  The Communion of Saints.

   "There is one body and one Spirit; even as ye are called in one hope of
   your calling."--Ephes. iv. 4.

   To classify Love among the works of the Holy Spirit is not a new
   invention. In this connection, to assign Love such a conspicuous place
   may be new, but the doctrine itself is as old as the Apostolic Creed,
   which confesses: "I believe in the Holy Ghost; in the Holy, Apostolic,
   Christian Church, in the communion of saints."

   For what is the communion of saints otherwise than Love in its noblest
   and richest manifestation? And how is it here presented but as the very
   fruit of the Holy Spirit? The work of the Father is confessed first;
   that of the Son in the Incarnation second; and coming to the work of
   the Holy Spirit, the Church confesses that this is not in the creation,
   nor in the Incarnation, but in the communion of saints, which, among
   men, is Love's tenderest and most glorious expression.

   "Communion of saints," i.e., the rule of Love, not among the selfish,
   the half-hearted, or still untried, new beginners, but among the
   initiated children of God, whose life is from God; a communion the
   foretaste of which is enjoyed on earth, the full enjoyment of which can
   be found only in heaven; a communion sweet and blessed, because it is
   unalloyed, and proceeds only from holy impressions; not springing from
   man's heart, but shed abroad in him from above when from a sinner he
   became a saint, and developing in him more warmly and tenderly as in
   his person the new man becomes more pronounced; a communion found among
   saints, not by chance, but because it is born from the fact that they
   are saints, rooted in their being saints, and derived from Him who
   sanctified them to be saints. Hence it is a love which death can not
   destroy; which, stronger than death, shall continue as long as there
   are saints, unquenched, forevermore.

   From which it is evident that the fathers had a thorough grasp of the
   magnificent thought that the Spirit's real, characteristic, and
   perpetual work is the shedding abroad of love; and they have expressed
   it in a beautiful and artistic form. The Holy Spirit was to them not a
   mystic Person in the Godhead, to whom they looked up in holy wonder,
   but God the Holy Ghost working with omnipotent power within and around
   them. Hence they followed the confession of the Holy Spirit by that of
   His creation, i.e., the Holy, Catholic, Christian Church, which is the
   body of Christ; and that by the confession of the communion of saints,
   wrought by the Holy Spirit in the Church.

   The Church and the communion of saints are two things. The former
   originated and existed before there was the slightest sign of the
   latter. The Church exists and continues, tho in unfavorable times the
   communion of saints suffers loss. The new-born child is unconscious of
   his relation to the family. He lives, but without any attachment,
   inclination, love, or bond of union for the family. Love does indeed
   exert its influence upon him, and cares for him, but does not yet live
   in and through him. Hence there is no communion between him and the
   other members of the family. And the same is true of the Church. She
   can exist, live, and increase before there is any conscious communion
   of saints. For which reason the communion of saints may languish,
   apparently disappear, yea, even be turned into bitterness.

   Hence the Church and the communion of saints are two things. First the
   Church which is the body, then the communion of saints, which is its
   support and nourishment.

   Wherefore it reads, not, I see or taste, but, I believe the communion
   of saints. Communion of saints belongs to the things invisible and
   unknown, which on earth are part of the tenor of the faith, and which
   in the New Jerusalem shall be turned into a rich and blessed
   experience. For this article of faith speaks, not of a communion of a
   few saints, members of the same small circle, but of "the communion of
   saints"; and this rich and comprehensive confession may not be
   belittled by a narrow conception of it. Communion of a few saints is
   not a thing unknown on earth; there is scarcely a spot where some of
   God's dear children do not live together in sweet fellowship. But such
   a little circle is by no means the body of Christ; and such sweet
   fellowship would be injurious if the fact were overlooked, that it must
   be a communion of all God's saints on earth--of the present, the past,
   and the future.

   To one living in an obscure hamlet faith in the communion of saints is
   the consciousness that he belongs to an exceedingly wealthy, numerous,
   holy, and elect family; and that instead of ever getting estranged from
   it, he shall ever be more closely united to it. It is the sacred
   knowledge that all the saints of the Old and New Covenants, all the
   heroes and heroines, the whole cloud of witnesses, together with
   apostles, prophets, and martyrs, and the redeemed in heaven, are not
   aliens to him, but with him belong to the same body; not only in name,
   but in reality, as shall once be gloriously manifested. It is the
   precious comfort for the lonely heart that, in all the ends of the
   earth, among all nations and peoples, in every city and village, God
   has His own whom He has called out and gathered unto life eternal; and
   that I share with them the same life, possess the same hope and
   calling, and sustain to them, however imperceptibly, the tenderest and
   holiest communion; yea, the firm and positive assurance that if the
   earth came suddenly to an end, and they only were to be saved who,
   being possessed of an eternal principle, had the power to bloom
   forever, that then all God's saints would come out as one holy family,
   in which holy circle the least of His servants would glitter as
   precious gems.

   And therefore this glorious communion should no longer be belittled by
   confining it to one's own small, often shallow environment. Of course
   there is no objection, when friends living in the same place, meeting
   together in the Lord, understanding one another, and edifying one
   another through the Word, speak of their small circle, in connection
   with the communion of saints. For, wherever in love and worship saints
   dwell together, there indeed the communion of saints breaks through the
   clouds, and vouchsafes unto them a glimpse of its brightness and glory.
   But, altho such dwelling together in unity stands in connection with
   the communion of saints, and is a result of it, and affords a foretaste
   of what it some time shall be, it is only a very small part and faint
   reflection of reality. In such a circle, however good, devout, and
   holy, the hearts become exclusive. Compared to the great and wide
   world-circle, they can not be otherwise than a small company. And this
   necessarily imparts to it something private and exclusive; while the
   communion of saints is the very opposite; not exclusive, but inclusive.
   It is not an idea which closes the door and shuts the windows; but,
   throwing doors and windows wide open, it walks through the four corners
   of the earth, searches the ages of the past, and looks forward into the
   ages to come.

   Communion of saints opens its arms as wide as possible. O my God! how
   can I encompass and embrace all the dear children whom Thou throughout
   the ages hast regenerated and still dost regenerate, the redeemed both
   in heaven and earth! There are a few of former generations whose books
   lie open upon our table, so that with Calvin we can pray, or with
   Augustine glory in a sin-pardoning God, or with Owen lose ourselves in
   the contemplation of the excellencies of Christ, or with Comrie walk in
   the paths of righteousness divine. But what are these few that speak
   compared to the thousands who are silent; who were each in his own way
   divinely endowed and adorned with spiritual gifts; who in heaven will
   once appear bright with crowns, our brethren and sisters now and
   forevermore? The communion of saints cries out: "Lengthen thy cords and
   strengthen thy stakes." For it is a communion not with hundreds, but
   with thousands; not with ten thousand, but with millions; a multitude
   that no man can number, as drops of water in the crystal sea which is
   before the throne of God.

   And this communion of saints will be real: not limited as in this
   earthly life, where living together in the same city we meet each other
   at the utmost ten times a year; but an actual living together the same
   life, eating together at the same board, drinking from the same cup,
   thinking the same thought, exhilarated by the same felicity, adoring
   the same unfathomable mercies of our God.

   In Europe our fellowship with thousands is now much fuller and richer
   than our fathers ever knew it. The means of communication are
   wonderfully improved and multiplied. Telegraph and telephone afford men
   communication not confined to place nor distance. They were never
   dreamt of before. It never entered the mind of man that in fifteen
   minutes a saint in America could exchange thoughts with a brother in
   Europe. This communion of saints was therefore to them an unsolved
   riddle. But to us the veil is partly lifted. Actually we see something
   of it: intercommunication of thought in minutest detail, not confined
   by distance, crossing the oceans, uniting continents. And yet, what are
   telegraph and telephone compared to the powers of the age to come? And
   thus we grope in the dark and wonder how it shall be when distance
   shall be no more, when material aids shall be superfluous, when God's
   children, active in whatever part of heaven, shall enjoy full, rich,
   and intimate communion, one in Immanuel, all partakers of the same
   Love.

   Why is the communion of saints an article of the creed of the Church on
   earth? (1) Because in the invisible world it is even now a reality; (2)
   because it is implied in the nature of the case; and (3) because it is
   already active in the germ.

   First, it exists already in the invisible world; for there is a
   triumphant Church above. Millions upon millions are fallen asleep in
   their Lord, and have entered the halls of the eternal Light. And altho
   to them the full glory of the Kingdom is not revealed, tarrying as it
   does until after the judgment Day, and the absence of the glorified
   body still detracts from the full communion of saints, yet even now the
   departed saints and martyrs live in such heavenly felicity that the
   word of the Psalmist, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for
   brethren to dwell together in unity," can be applied only to that
   heavenly company.

   Second, and altho in that sense it is not found on the earth, yet it is
   implied and does exist in the nature of the case; and as such it must
   be the object of faith. We profess to believe in the Holy Spirit, who
   does not live apart from the Church, but has descended in the Church
   and in all the members of Christ, in whom He dwells and works; which
   fact He seeks to bring to their individual consciousness. And since it
   is the essence of self-denial on the part of the saint to let the Holy
   Spirit work in him more and more, being only a colaborer himself, it is
   evident that the activity of faith must have this one result: that
   there is in all God's saints but one Worker, working in you and me and
   in all who love the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is a fact
   of which all are conscious, the effect of which must be the most
   intimate harmony of life, one growth from the same root, and a strong
   mutual attraction between all the members. In the one Holy Spirit the
   work in the souls of all must concentrate. It may not appear on the
   surface, but underneath the surface all these waters must flow together
   in the communion of saints.

   Third, and this is verified by experience; for we clearly discover the
   germ of it in the earth. To some extent it is evident in our own
   intimate circle: in the reading of old books, and in the singing of old
   hymns; it is evident when we hear how God's work prospers or suffers in
   other places, in other countries, and among other nations. For,
   whatever the differences, this we notice, that it is the same language
   of love spoken at the ends of the earth; that among all men it is the
   same casting down and raising up of the sinner; one blessed, divine
   communion of which men testify in every human tongue. Yea, more, there
   are but few of God's children who have not at some time in their lives
   seen their spiritual horizon enlarged, and heard, as it were, the Song
   of the Lamb ascending from the ends of the earth, and unnumbered
   multitudes crying: "We also glory in the Love that is eternal,
   merciful, and divine; we also are pilgrims to Zion, the City of the
   Living God." This is the activity of faith which, escaping from the
   present limitations, glories in the unbounded communion of God's
   saints, who still bear the cross, or who already wear the crown.

  XXVI.

  The Communion of Goods.

   "If we walk in the light, we have fellowship one with another."-- 1
   John i. 7.

   The communion of saints is in the Light. In heaven alone, in the halls
   of the eternal Light, it shall shine with undimmed brightness. Even on
   earth its delights are known only inasmuch as the saints walk in the
   light.

   This communion of saints is a holy confederacy; a bond of shareholders
   in the same holy enterprise; a partnership of all God's children; an
   essential union for the enjoyment of a common good; a firm not of
   earth, but of heaven, in which the members have each an equal share,
   which is not taken from their own wealth, but bequeathed in their
   behalf by Another.

   Do not think that this savors too much of secularism. Even the Lord
   Jesus compared the kingdom of heaven to a merchant, and to one who had
   found a treasure in the field. And our Catechism also explains the
   communion of saints as the possession of a common good, saying that it
   includes two things:

   First, to be partakers of Christ and of all His riches and gifts.

   Second, the obligation to employ these gifts for the advantage and
   salvation of other members.

   Originally communion of saints was taken in the absolute sense of
   including communion of earthly possessions. Hence the peculiar
   phenomenon in Jerusalem of having all things common. They sold their
   possessions and they put the proceeds in the common treasury, which was
   in the hands of the apostles. And from this the poor and they who were
   formerly rich were supported. Hence there were no poor nor rich, but
   there was equality:

   With reference to this communion of goods, opposite opinions are held.
   Some have taken it as an indication that all Christians ought to
   renounce their private possessions, and live after the manner of monks,
   as members of one family; while others have disapproved of it as an
   extravagance of Christian fanaticism. Both extremes are untenable.

   It appears from Scripture that this generous and enthusiastic effort to
   escape from the plague of poverty was not only unprofitable to the few,
   but that it caused terrible suffering which extended over the whole
   Church. At least, in his epistles, St. Paul speaks again and again of
   the poverty-stricken saints of Jerusalem, who were always in need of a
   collection and in danger of starvation. In other places that did not
   have a communion of goods there was a surplus; and in Jerusalem, where
   on a large scale possessions had been divided, the people suffered
   lack. This shows convincingly that division of property, or communion
   of goods, is not the way ordained of God to overcome poverty or to
   attain a state of higher mutual prosperity. The subsequent efforts of
   various sects at Rome to realize a similar ideal on a smaller and more
   careful scale met with similar failures. And the secular enterprises of
   Proudhon and others led to similar miserable results.

   But it is equally erroneous to suppose that this failure justifies us
   in condemning the early church of Jerusalem for this act. This would be
   inconsistent with the upholding of the apostolic authority. The
   apostles had a part in this matter; they assisted the church in
   receiving the money for distribution. Hence to tear the apostles' seal
   from this heroic act of the church of Jerusalem is simply impossible.
   We should be careful not to condemn what the apostles have stamped with
   their own sign-manual.

   Judging from the results, this communion of goods and subsequent misery
   produced precious fruit; partly in the fact that the church of
   Jerusalem was thus kept from relapsing into worldliness and attachment
   to houses and lands; and more strongly in the other fact that this very
   impoverishing of the church became the powerful means by which the
   breach was prevented between the churches of Palestine and those of the
   Gentile world. The distress at Jerusalem quenched the rising pride of
   the Jewish heart; and the delight of imparting to others softened the
   hearts at Corinth and in Macedonia. St. Paul, traveling to Jerusalem,
   carrying with him European treasure, holds in his hand the silver cord
   that keeps together and shortly unites the troubled churches.

   But, apart from these good results, this division of property embodies
   something of still greater and more sacred importance, which
   essentially belongs to the first Christian congregation. International
   intercommunication was to be developed gradually; the translation of
   the Word of God into the languages of the world for the universal
   preaching of the Gospel would occupy many centuries. Even now it is not
   universal; and only in heaven, after the judgment, the anthem shall
   rise to the Blessed Trinity from all peoples and tongues. And yet,
   while this was tarrying, and the Church of the New Testament was just
   beginning to manifest itself, it pleased God on Pentecost, by the
   miracle of tongues, to make men listen to the glorious message which
   came from the lips of the apostles, to every one in his own language:
   And the same is true with reference to the communion of goods. Even
   this shall one day be a reality. Heaven's outward, visible goods shall
   be for the mutual enjoyment of all the redeemed. But, by reason of sin
   and present limitations, this is now impossible. In Paradise private
   possession was out of the question. Neither Adam nor Eve had anything
   that did not belong to the other. The whole garden was theirs and its
   possession mutual. Division took place only after the breach had come,
   and will continue so long as the breach shall last. But as on Pentecost
   the miracle of tongues was the prophecy, manifestation, and incipient
   realization of what before the Throne of the Lamb shall be a glorious,
   universal reality, so was the communion of goods the prophecy,
   manifestation, and incipient realization of what shall be the communion
   of external gifts in the heavenly glory.

   There is not only an immortality of the soul, but also a resurrection
   of the body. Wherefore the glory of the New Jerusalem may not be
   presented as consisting only in the spiritual and invisible. Heaven
   exists, and in that heaven Christ sits upon the throne in the body
   which the Father has prepared for Him. The Father's house is not a
   fiction, but a real city with many mansions; and when the glory shall
   have come, after the great and notable day of the Lord, the felicity of
   God's children shall be not only a spiritual delight, but also the
   enjoyment of outward and visible glory and beauty. As there were in
   Eden, so there will be in heaven, external goods in relation to man's
   external bodily appearance, when he shall walk in his glorified body.
   And, since body and soul in perfect and indissoluble union shall work
   upon each other in a harmonious manner, the communion of saints must
   have two sides: a communion of spiritual good, and a communion of the
   outward and visible glory. And inasmuch as this twofold nature of the
   communion of saints must be illustrated to the church of Jerusalem in
   its perfect unity, therefore the communion in the breaking of bread had
   to be accompanied by a communion equally intimate in the possession of
   temporal goods. The division of property contained the prophecy of this
   future communion, a glorious prophecy which contains a threefold
   exhortation for the Christian Church of all ages.

   The first exhortation is what St. Paul calls "to possess as not
   possessing"; to be loose from the world; the consistent carrying out of
   the idea that we are but stewards of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the
   only Proprietor of all men's personal property and real estate. It is
   always the choice between Jehovah and Mammon.

   Not Baal, nor Kamosh, nor Molech, but Mammon, is the idolatrous power
   in which Satan appears against the glory of Jehovah, especially among
   mercantile nations. Many men, otherwise not unspiritual, can scarcely
   separate from the altar of Mammon--visible things have such strong
   attraction, and entrench themselves so firmly in the impressionable
   heart.

   Compared to the treasures on earth, those of heaven seem to us
   something accidental and of uncertain value. To possess as not
   possessing is to our flesh such a bitter cross. And for this reason the
   early church of Jerusalem appears in the beginning of the dispensation
   of the New Covenant glorious in her communion of goods, in order to
   illustrate against the dark background of the half-heartedness of
   Ananias and Sapphira the power of the Holy Ghost to make the children
   of God at Jerusalem at once loose from their earthly possessions. Of
   course it did not last, for the spiritual forces of Paradise were
   lacking to make it lasting; but it shows the majestic act of the Holy
   Spirit, and the majestic preaching which proceeded from it: "Do not lay
   up for yourselves treasures on earth," "but let your treasure be in
   heaven."

   And the second exhortation is, that the poor be remembered. They did
   not merely sell their possessions, but they divided them among the
   poor; and from this divine manifestation of love sprang the fair flower
   of mercy, as indigenous to the Church of Christ. It may be said that it
   was the effect of excitement; but remember that, unless the impressions
   on our sinful hearts are produced in a very powerful manner, they will
   soon be effaced; and with this in view it must be acknowledged that no
   other event could have stamped upon the Church the impress of mercy,
   which was to last throughout the ages, so long as the Church was to
   last, than this general division of goods, which was wrought by the
   powerful pressure of the waves of love and the wonderful manifestation
   of the work of the Holy Spirit.

   And thus, by this communion of goods, it became the indestructible
   character of the Church of Christ to exercise mercy, to impart to the
   poor, to abound in the works of benevolence, and to interpret to men
   the mercy of God. But not as tho the Church might be reduced to a
   benevolent society; he that proposes such a thing cuts off her life at
   the root. The exercise of mercy in the Church of Christ is the fruit of
   the Cross. Where this is lacking, mercy languishes. But it is the Holy
   Spirit's pleasure to work love, to show love, to cultivate love, and to
   cause love to be glorified. And since the life of man and of the Church
   has a spiritual and a material side, the Holy Spirit perseveres with
   His work so long and so mightily that even the gold and silver of the
   earth become subject to Him and serve Him. Hence the communion of goods
   in Jerusalem is the impressive inauguration of the work of mercy for
   the whole Church of Christ, and as such it is nothing else than the
   power of the Holy Spirit penetrating to the circle of the material
   life.

   Finally, the third exhortation is contained in the never-ceasing cry:
   "Behold, He cometh." The men in Jerusalem nineteen centuries ago would
   not have sold and divided their possessions so freely and readily if
   the expectation of the Lord's return to judgment had not taken hold of
   them with overwhelming power. They did undoubtedly expect that return
   during their own lifetime; not after many days, but shortly. And since
   this expectation depreciated the value of their possessions, they
   resolved to sell and distribute them much more readily than otherwise
   would have been possible for their covetous hearts. And altho there was
   in their expectation something overstrained, which the succeeding ages
   have corrected, yet there is in this "Maranatha" of the apostolic
   Church an inestimable testimony, which exhorts the Church of all ages
   to look upon Him who shall come upon the clouds. With bread and cup we
   remember His death until He comes. All the apostles direct us to the
   future; and when, in the Revelation of St. John, the Book of Testaments
   closes, it leaves us upon the mountain-top, from which there is no
   other perspective than the glory of Christ's return.

   Putting that return far from our thoughts, or altogether ignoring it,
   we can not possibly unite our life with the life of Immanuel. The Holy
   Spirit works the eternal work of Love; but this work is never severed
   from the Love of the Son. The treasure which the Holy Spirit
   distributes is in Immanuel. Christ is the Blessed Head of this holy
   communion in which He gathers together all God's elect. And, therefore,
   the eye may never be taken from Christ; it must always look unto Him;
   it may not cease to wait for Him.

   This Love wrought by the Holy Spirit is the Bride's love for her
   Bridegroom; and thus the communion of saints finds its completion in
   the heart's most intimate communion with the Redeemer of souls.

  XXVII.

  The Communion of Gifts.

   "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of
   a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."--1 Tim. i. 5.

   Communion of goods in Jerusalem was a symbol. It typified the communion
   of the spiritual goods which constituted the real treasure of
   Jerusalem's saints. The other inhabitants of that city possessed
   houses, fields, furniture, gold, and silver just as well as the saints,
   and perhaps in greater abundance. But the latter were to receive riches
   which neither Jew, Roman, nor Greek possessed, viz., a treasure in
   heaven. The saints were holy, not in themselves, but through Him who
   had said, "Now are ye clean through the words which I have spoken unto
   you." (John xv. 3) The Lord had indeed ascended unto heaven, but only
   "to receive gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord
   God might dwell among them." And this treasure was Christ Himself.

   Speaking of the contribution which was being collected in Macedonia,
   Achaia, and Corinth for the saints in Jerusalem, the apostle admonishes
   the Corinthian church to render thanks to God for a gift infinitely
   greater than the gold which was to be sent to Jerusalem; and it is in
   this connection that he uses that captivating expression--" unspeakable
   gift "--which we received in the surrender of God's dear Son.

   It is, therefore, a mutual possession. Jesus has us, and we have Him.
   He possesses the saints, and they possess Him. That He possesses them
   is their only comfort in life and death. But that they also possess
   Him, as their own heart's treasure, is to them source of all their
   wealth and luxury. The Catechism confesses, therefore, very correctly
   that the communion of saints consists first of all in the fact that
   they are partakers of Him, and then of His gifts.

   The gift is not without the Person, nor outside of the Person, nor even
   before the Person. The saint partakes first of Christ, and from this
   sacred partnership flows every other blessing. Even as the Head
   possesses the Body, and the Body possesses the Head, so is this also a
   mutual possession. Head and Body belong to each other, even tho the
   Head has this advantage over the Body, that it commands it at will,
   while the Body must follow the Head wherever it leads. "To follow the
   Lamb wherever He goeth" is the peculiar mark of this mutual relation.

   But, with the reservation of this essential mark, the possession is
   absolute. The saints belong to Jesus, just as much because the Father
   has given and brought them to Him, as that He has bought them, not with
   gold or silver, but with His own precious blood. And, on the contrary,
   He belongs to His saints, not because by their own labor they have
   obtained Him, but as a gift of free grace. The Triune God has ordained
   the Mediator for His people, to whom He has given and brought Him; and
   the Mediator having come in the flesh, has given Himself to His people.

   Every child of God knows from his own experience that Christ is all his
   treasure. When Mary Magdalen cries out, "They have taken away my Lord,"
   (John xx. 13) she has lost all the wealth of her soul. The saints stand
   in the faith and have peace only when, in so far, and as long as they
   possess Immanuel. He is their One and All. As soon as they find Him,
   all their poverty is turned into wealth. Without Him they are blind and
   naked; with Him want and misery make place for riches and abundance.
   With Him they are set in heaven. And when they depart from this life
   their hope and lot for eternity depend upon this, whether they possess
   Him as their souls' Savior, glorious and altogether lovely.

   Hence this is the most important: the great treasure of the saints in
   Jerusalem was their Lord. This comprehended all. Every other treasure
   was theirs only through Him. To possess Him was to possess all that He
   had obtained for them, even justification and sanctification; all the
   power given Him of the Father for their assistance and protection; all
   the wisdom and light, and all the charismata, gifts of grace, received
   of the Father for distribution among His people.

   However, they could not make this partnership available, for their
   treasure lay beyond their reach; was not in earth, but in heaven.
   Actually they remained poor and perplexed; rich for the future, but now
   needy and helpless.

   The following illustration will make this clear. An English
   millionaire, well supplied with bank-notes, in an African village finds
   himself reduced to beggary. The natives, ignorant of his wealth and not
   understanding the value of bank-notes, refuse to sell him anything but
   for their own currency. Hence with all his treasure he is in that
   distant place poor and destitute. In like manner, being pilgrims, and
   sojourners in the earth, the saints would be spiritually poor and needy
   if there were no Comforter, no Go-between, who out of His heavenly
   treasure could supply all their need during all the days of their
   pilgrimage. And this Go-between is the Holy Spirit. Of Himself He has
   nothing. By Himself He could never save a sinner. He never adopted the
   flesh and blood of children and dwelled among us; never suffered, died,
   and rose again in their behalf. All that He can do is to pray for them
   with groans that can not be uttered, and in divine love come and dwell
   with them. But what the Holy Spirit does not possess Christ possesses,
   who, in our flesh, rich in His cross-merits, lives with the Father in
   our behalf.

   And from that treasure in Christ the Holy Spirit takes and imparts to
   the saints, as the money exchanger supplies the English traveler with
   the native currency. Not only does He give them the spiritual gold and
   silver as it lies in Christ's treasury, but He converts it into such
   forms as their present needs and conflicts require. And this is the
   peculiarly comforting feature of the Holy Spirit's work. He does not
   scatter this treasure from heaven promiscuously, but brings it home to
   each of us in a form adapted to meet our every condition and capacity.
   He does not give strong meat to babes nor milk to adults, but to every
   spiritual patient according to the nature of his complaint. Better than
   the patient himself does He understand the nature of his infirmity, to
   which as the divine Physician He adapts the remedy.

   To the saints of Jerusalem and to those of the present time Christ must
   be a common possession. As the former had their material property in
   common--and this the latter should have also, in higher sense, through
   the works of mercy--so had they and so have we our spiritual treasure
   as a common possession, in the same Immanuel, who enriches all. But the
   saints being unable rightly to divide their treasure, the Holy Spirit
   divides it for them. He takes every member's portion as it lies in
   Christ, marked with His name, especially adapted for his particular
   need, and distributes it carefully and without mistakes, so that every
   saint receives his own. And while thus every one partakes of Christ and
   of His gifts, the one Christ with His treasure is common to all.

   In the child we can see something of the Love cultivated by a mutual
   possession. Love between the parents may have grown cold, but so long
   as both can say of their little one, She is mine, and "mine" may become
   "ours," there is hope that the former love may return. In spite of
   their differences both possess the one child, who with all her love and
   sweetness belongs to both. And this applies in higher sense to the
   Christ. In the Church are many saints, and every one says: "Immanuel is
   my Bridegroom." And this individual testimony is turned at last into
   the general anthem of praise: "Immanuel is our Lord." Surely every
   saint finds in Christ something especially adapted to himself, yet all
   possess the one Lord and all His treasure. And this is the very power
   of love which in blessing watches over all. Love may grow cold and in
   an evil hour be turned into bitterness; but this is only temporarily;
   love must return. As in the wealth of the mutual possession husband and
   wife felt their union, so do the saints, considering their mutual
   possession of Immanuel, feel themselves bound together by Love's
   overwhelming impression.

   "One baptism, one faith, one Lord, one Jesus for every heart," "one
   Immanuel whom all call precious," and herein alone lies Love's power to
   keep in unity, and, after temporary separation, to reunite all the
   saints of God.

   And as the communion of goods in Jerusalem was symbol of the saints'
   mutual possession in Immanuel, so it was also the symbolic indication
   of their individual obligation, to have the gifts in common possession,
   by willingly and diligently using them for the highest advantage of the
   other members.

   The Lord imparts "Gifts," "ministrations," and "operations" as St. Paul
   calls them (1 Cor. xii. 4, 5, 6); adding that all these gifts are of
   the same Spirit, and these ministrations of the same Lord, and these
   operations of the God who worketh all in all. And then he shows that it
   is the duty of the saints to use these gifts, ministrations, and
   operations not selfishly for one's own glory, but for the Body of the
   Lord, which is His Church.

   And by this God's true children are best known; and they know
   themselves best in the gracious operation of which they are the
   subjects. For when the Holy Spirit imparts talents and gifts, the
   tempter whispers in the ear that it will be for their best advantage to
   use these gifts for each one's own glory, with their brightness to
   shine and to make himself a name among men, and in that way the
   blessing will crown the labor as a matter of course. And alas! many
   listen to these whisperings and thus defraud the household of faith of
   their individual gifts, not understanding the meaning of the beehive,
   which teaches that one can purify honey without eating of it.

   And we should not judge too severely; this temptation is much harder
   than many are willing to acknowledge, especially for the ministers of
   the Word. The people greatly admire your sermon, praise you for it,
   talk about it, and carry you upon their shoulders. And by this
   miserable burning of incense one is intoxicated before he knows it. It
   is no more the question whether Jesus is satisfied, whether there is a
   spiritual gain for the glory of His name, but almost exclusively: Did
   the people like it? How did it affect them? And after a ten-years'
   ministry under the influence of such evil whisperings, the result can
   scarcely be anything but the talent buried out of sight, the sacred
   office desecrated, all spiritual operation suspended, and the minister
   of the Word little more than a minister to his own glory. And the same
   evil appears among the laymen. There is a lack of tenderness, of love,
   of consecration, frequently an abuse of spiritual gifts for the
   gratifying of the ambitious heart. Oh, we are so fearfully weak and
   sinful! Surely, every talent would be buried and every good gift
   spoiled were there no Holy Spirit, who with divine and superior power
   watches against this evil. For when in the Church the conscience
   awakes, and talents and gifts are once more emancipated from the yoke
   of selfish ambition, we see in it not our work, but the Holy Spirit's.
   Then we do our duty. Then the communion of saints revives. Then the
   saints are once more ready with gift and talent to serve the Lord and
   their brethren. But the power which wrought the miracle of Love was not
   ours, but of the Holy Spirit.

  XXVIII.

  The Suffering of Love.

   "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
   his friend."--John xv. 13.

   Love suffers because the spirit of the world antagonizes the Spirit of
   God. The former is unholy, the Latter is holy, not in the sense of mere
   opposition to the world's spirit, but because He is the absolute Author
   of all holiness, being God Himself. Hence the conflict.

   There is no point along the whole line of the world's life which does
   not antagonize the Holy Spirit whenever He touches it. Whenever we are
   tempted by the world and inwardly animated by the Holy Spirit, there is
   a clash in the conscience: As soon as one member breathes a worldly
   spirit and another testifies against it in the Spirit of holiness,
   there is trouble and strife in the family. When in state, school,
   church, or society a worldly tendency appears and a current from the
   divine Spirit, there is trouble and strife in one or all. These two
   oppose each other and can not be reconciled. Compromise is impossible.
   Either one, the worldly spirit, at last closes our hearts against the
   Holy Spirit, and then we are lost; or after long conflict the Holy
   Spirit vanquishes the world's spirit; then the prince of this world
   finds nothing in us, and our names are written in the gate of the New
   Jerusalem.

   And this causes love to suffer. When love increases in our hearts,
   owing to the Holy Spirit's increasing activity, it must come into
   conflict with all that pertains to the world's spirit and seeks to
   maintain itself in the soul.

   This is evident more or less in little children. Indulgence is the
   easiest, but not the best, method of education. The indulgent mother
   does not love her children, but sacrifices them to her weakness. She
   finds it easier not to oppose their wrongdoing; thus avoiding tears,
   contradiction, and ill-will. When they call her "darling mother" it is
   sweet music to her ear; hence she never looks displeased, and rather
   than deny them anything she anticipates their desires. So she loves,
   not them, but herself. Her aim is not their good, or the doing of God's
   will concerning them and herself; but to save unpleasantness and to
   insure to herself the children's affection. But not so she who loves
   her children with the Love shed abroad by the Holy Ghost. Actuated by
   His Love, looking upon them in His light, she seeks their eternal good.
   To her each child is a patient in need of bitter medicine, which she
   may not withhold. Her aim is not the gratification of the child's wish,
   but his highest advantage in the way of life. And this causes conflict;
   for while the indulgent mother is ever pleased with her children and
   ever ready to hear men praise them, the other is often tossed between
   hope and fear, saying; "What will the end be?" Moreover, the time will
   come when her child, not understanding her love, will resist her, when
   he will think her lovely only when she indulges him, when he will
   reward her devotion with angry look and voice and wilful disobedience,
   when his conversation becomes constraint, when, regarding her as
   jealous of his pleasures, with a rebellious heart he will turn away
   from her love, while before God she is conscious that she seeks only
   his highest and holiest interests.

   There is another picture of suffering love. There never arose among men
   one that had greater love than Christ. In the human heart love never
   shone with brighter light, never glowed with brighter flame of Love.
   Without measure He had received the Holy Spirit, who abode upon Him,
   who filled Him with tenderest love that pervaded the soul and softened
   the heart. His love understood the secret of embracing in truest
   intimacy all that was human, and at the same time of breathing love
   that came like a benediction to every individual. He gave Himself to
   the whole race, and He opens His heart for an old, blind Jew in the
   gate of Jericho. Such is the infinite, rich, and almost omnipotent
   power of His love. It encompasses eternity, yet there is no outcast,
   however degraded, too low for its compassions.

   And what reception did the world prepare for Him? Did it offer Him
   love, honor, and admiration? Did it appreciate His holy love and kindle
   its own heart by its flame? On the contrary, the world was offended by
   it, could not bear it, counted it as mortal hatred; for He denied it
   its joys and sinful pleasures. He did not even smile when it was full
   of laughter, but when it begged for His applause He had only rebuke. He
   prevented the Jerusalem aristocrat from being a Pharisee, and the
   worldling from being a Sadducee. His whole appearance was a living
   protest against the world's regime. Hence the world opposed Him,
   treated His Love as hatred, and returned it with contempt. Of course,
   if He had only lamented when it mourned, or danced when it piped unto
   Him in the market-place, it would have built Him a throne. But since He
   loved it with a holy love and yielded not to its entreaty, therefore it
   beat Him, embittered His life, and covered Him with shame and mockery.
   And when He persisted to love and admonish, it pronounced its
   "Anathema," and the planting of the cross on Calvary was only a
   question of time.

   And what it did to Jesus it has done to all His followers. He that
   yields is tolerated. He that makes room for the world's spirit receives
   burning of incense. He that makes compromise with it may be assured of
   honor and glory; but he that refuses to compromise, loving the world
   with holy love, must sooner or later experience its wrath. God's people
   in every place and nation have ever sung: "Many are the afflictions of
   the righteous." Every age has its martyr-history. And the best ages of
   our race, in which the Holy Spirit exerted His mightiest power, are but
   the times when the noblest and godliest saints suffered cruelest
   tortures and endured greatest wrongs.

   Cause for love's suffering lies in its origin. Since it is the Holy
   Spirit who radiates its heat in the heart, and keeps its fire burning
   from moment to moment, the unholy hate and reject it.

   Love can bear, but not tolerate, all things. It bears sufferings,
   because it does not tolerate the worldly spirit; but the cry of
   "mildness" and "moderation" never tempts it to quench the hatred with
   which it has entered the conflict with unholiness. For real love is
   also real hatred. He that loves feebly or falsely can not hate
   energetically. But if ardent, animating love reigns in your heart, then
   hatred reigns with it. He that loves the beautiful hates the ugly. He
   that loves harmony hates discord. In like manner, he that has fallen in
   love with holiness has conceived by the Holy Spirit an equally strong
   hatred for all unholiness. Love for Jesus can not exist but with hatred
   for Satan. And the best measure for the love of God in our hearts is
   the depth of contempt for sin.

   He that loves the world hates God, and has made God his enemy; as the
   Catechism correctly remarks: "By nature we are prone to hate God and
   our neighbor." "The carnal mind is enmity against God." But the man
   whose soul overflows with the love of God hates the unholy spirit of
   the world in and around him, and fights against it until the hour of
   his death. David's testimony " Do I not hate them, O Lord, that hate
   Thee? I hate them with perfect hatred" (Psalm cxxxix. 21)--is only the
   reverse of the stamp of love. And if among those born of the will of
   man there never was one who could truly say, "Lord, I hate them with
   perfect hatred"; yet there was One in whose heart this hatred was deep
   and true, who alone could say "that He loved God with all His heart and
   soul and mind and strength."

   This mutual position is therefore very clear. There are degrees both in
   love and in hatred. In proportion as the heart beats strongly or
   feebly, i.e., in proportion as the spirit of this world or the Holy
   Spirit dwells in us and animates us to stronger expression, in that
   proportion that love or that hatred shall rise in us in higher degree.
   And according to that degree shall the proportion of our present
   conflict, sorrow, and suffering be.

   "Through suffering to glory" is true especially with reference to love.
   Being love, it can not be neutral or insensible. And while its contact
   with men causes it much suffering, this suffering is, increased by the
   conflict in its own bosom.

   For this pure, holy love loves itself, but only in a holy sense. Altho
   it can not purge its heart all at once from all unholiness and
   impurity, yet it constantly wars against them and separates itself from
   them. And since in that conflict it is often convinced of its own lack
   of love and faithfulness, and of having grieved the divine Love, it
   sorrows much. Frequently it feels so humbled in the presence of Jesus
   that it scarcely dares look up to Him; humbled in the presence of His
   cross; conscious of its inability to self-sacrifice; humbled before its
   own loved ones whom it ought to bless, whom it frequently injures; and
   especially in the presence of the Holy Spirit, who tenderly sought to
   animate it, and whom it often silenced by this lack of courage and will
   power.

   And this grieves the soul of the saint, who seeks in vain for the
   evidence of his sonship in the love of his own fickle heart. And if
   this love were of man, it would perish at last. But it is not. It is of
   the Holy Spirit, shed abroad and fanned by Him continually. Hence it is
   never quenched, but however near perishing, it is reanimated, and,
   burning anew with a bright flame, it reenters the conflict.

   History offers the evidence. There were times when the early Church was
   nearly exterminated; when the Waldensians were nearly blotted out from
   the face of the earth; when our fathers consecrated and sacrificed
   their lives on this blood-drenched soil, in order not to deny the Lord
   their God. For among these martyrs there were men and women to whom it
   seemed impossible to give their lives for Christ; who often thought:
   "When it comes to me, I will surely fail." And yet when it did come,
   the Holy Spirit so graciously and extraordinarily steeled these souls
   that the cripple at once leaped like a hart, and they who did not think
   it possible to yield their goods, sacrificed their lives for His Name's
   sake. Then it was shown that in God's child the love of Christ is an
   eternal love, which, being born of His sacrifice, is stronger than
   death--yea, fearless in the presence of torture and martyrdom.

  Love in the Old Covenant.

   "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another."-- John
   xiii. 34.

   In connection with the Holy Spirit's work of shedding abroad the love
   of God in our hearts, the question arises: What is the meaning of
   Christ's word, "A new commandment I give unto you"? How can He
   designate this natural injunction, "To love one another," a new
   commandment?

   This offers no difficulty to those who entertain the erroneous view
   that during His ministry on earth Christ established a new and higher
   religion, to supersede the antiquated religion of Israel.

   They assert that the ancient religious ideas of the Jews were crude,
   defective, and primitive, even far below pagan morality. Among Israel
   themselves it was an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. For their
   enemies they pursed vindictive hatred. They sang imprecatory psalms.
   And to crown all, they indulged the bloodthirsty desire of dashing the
   enemy's innocent babes against the stones. Among this rude and
   barbarous people Jesus arose to proclaim a higher and nobler religion.
   He said: "Ye have heard it was said of old time, An eye for an eye, a
   tooth for a tooth!' but I say: Resist him not that is evil.' Ye have
   heard that it was said, Thou shalt hate thine enemy'; but I say unto
   you: Love your enemies.' And whatever shortsighted Moses may have
   taught ancient Israel, I, Jesus, give you a new commandment, that ye
   love one another."

   In this sense the words "new commandment "offer no difficulty. "New,"
   representing the Christian religion, is opposed to the "old," which
   stands for the Mosaic law. But however plausible, this representation
   is thoroughly false and contradicted by obvious facts.

   In Matt. v. 17-20, Christ introduces the subject by showing that He
   does not oppose His Gospel as a superior code of morals to the
   antiquated and inferior Mosaic code, but that it is His aim, by
   opposing the false interpretations of Moses by the liberal, rabbinical
   schools, to restore the Mosaic law to its legitimate position. He says:
   "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, but to fulfil; not merely
   in a general sense, as tho the valuable germ which it may contain
   needed, for its development, only to be divested from its outward
   covering, but to fulfil it to its very jot or tittle. For whosoever
   shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of
   heaven." From verse 20 it is clear that He opposes, not the
   righteousness of Moses, but the false interpretation of it by the
   liberal rabbis.

   And after this introduction He continues: "Ye have heard that it was
   said to them of old time, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy
   enemy." (Matt. v. 43) Did you ever find this in the Old Testament?
   Indeed not; on the contrary, in Prov. xxv. 21 it reads: "If thine enemy
   be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water
   to drink"; and in Exod. xxiii. 3, 4, Israel was taught: "If thou meet
   thine enemy's ox or ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back
   to him again. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under
   his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help
   with him."

   Hence it is unfair to say that the Old Testament teaches a low and
   unholy morality, for it inculcates the very opposite. The words
   disapproved by Jesus are found not in the Old Testament, but in the
   writings of the liberal rabbis. "Liberal," we say, for many of the
   rabbis did not support this interpretation. This shows that a man
   actually lowers himself when he lays upon the lips of Jesus a charge
   against the Old Testament which can be preferred only against the
   liberal rabbis.

   Without going into the details of Matt. v. 21 ff., there is another
   reason why "new commandment" can not be interpreted by making it to
   oppose the law of Christian love to the Mosaic commandment of hatred.
   If Matt. v. 43, "Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love
   thy neighbor and hate thine enemy," had been the old commandment of
   Moses, Jesus could have opposed it by this new commandment: "But I say
   unto you, Love thy neighbor and thine enemy." That would have had
   sense. But of the "new commandment" He speaks, not in this passage, but
   in John xiii. 34, where He treats, not of love for the enemy, but of
   neighborly and brotherly love. He has just washed the disciples' feet;
   no enemy is present, He is among friends. And then He says, not, "Moses
   gave you the old commandment to love one another, but I say, Love even
   your enemy, and this is My new commandment"; but, "A new commandment I
   give unto you, that [in your own circle] you love one another."

   Hence it is evident that this whole representation, as tho the new
   commandment of love opposed the Mosaic commandment of hatred, can not
   for a moment be maintained. And apart from this, the divine law of
   Sinai can not be anything but a perfect law; and Jesus, Himself being
   its Author, can not contradict Himself.

   In order to prevent the drawing of such pernicious inference from the
   words "a new commandment," St. John declares emphatically: "And now I
   beseech thee, lady, not as tho I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but
   that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another" (2
   John 5). And to make it still more impossible, he calls the same
   commandment old and new, according to the viewpoint from which it is
   considered: "Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
   commandment, which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is
   the word which ye have heard from the beginning. Again a new
   commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in Him and in you;
   because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth." (1 John
   ii. 7, 8)

   The way is now open to arrive at the right understanding of this new
   commandment, especially with reference to the subject under treatment.

   Jesus and the disciples have entered the inner sanctuary of His
   passion. Golgotha discloses itself. The painful strife of the
   feet-washing and of the expulsion of the traitor is ended. And during
   these solemn moments Jesus speaks of His departure, of the coming of
   the Holy Spirit, and of the new relation which henceforth God's people
   shall sustain to the Messiah. From Paradise to the Lord's return there
   is but one salvation for all the elect, but one way in which all walk,
   but one gate through which all must pass. The whole redemptive work
   flows from one unchangeable counsel. And herein lies the unity of the
   Old and New Covenants.

   But, altho we fully acknowledge this unity, we may not overlook the
   fact that, in different dispensations and circumstances, the saints
   sustain different relations to their Lord. To see the atonement
   typified in the promises of the ceremonial sacrifice is one thing, to
   look at it as finished on Calvary is quite another; and the difference
   creates a modified relation. The same is true of living before or after
   the Incarnation. To walk with Jesus on earth, or to know Him in heaven,
   puts the saints in a different position. Our departed friends and those
   who shall live at the return of the Lord are in different relations;
   for the latter shall not die, but be changed in a moment when this
   mortal shall be swallowed up of life.

   The subject of Christ's conversation before He entered Gethsemane was
   this change of the mutual position and relation. He strongly emphasizes
   the new fact of the coming of the Holy Spirit to be their Comforter. He
   Himself will depart, but their treasure will be even richer and more
   glorious. Hence they need not fear. They will receive the Holy Spirit
   whom He will send them from the Father. Not as tho the Holy Spirit had
   not wrought already for and in Israel's saints; for then faith and
   salvation would have been impossible. In fact, His work in the souls of
   men is as old as the generation of the elect, and originates in
   Paradise. But to the saints under the Old Covenant this operation came
   from without; while now, being freed from the fetters of Israel, the
   body of the Church itself becomes the bearer of the Holy Spirit, who
   descends upon it, dwells within it, and thus works upon its members
   from within.

   This is the new thing. This is Pentecost. This is all the difference
   between the dispensation before and after Christ's Resurrection. This
   is His promise to and for His disciples and for all His saints.

   And in this connection Christ speaks of the new commandment, that they
   should love one another. The same love commanded them by Moses was now
   to affect them in a different way, since by His departure they were to
   enter into a different relation. It is not a rare occurrence when the
   children of the same family, suddenly orphaned, feel as it were a more
   intimate relation to each other than they ever felt before, and at
   their parents' grave pledge one another a new love. As they stand at
   the open sepulcher and look at each other, they suddenly feel a
   sensation in their hearts hitherto unknown; it is the realization of a
   new relation. It is the old, and yet a new love, with a new conception,
   a new motive, a new consecration. So it is here. So long as they were
   with Jesus, the disciples loved one another; yet they never understood
   the close and unique character of the relation. But when Jesus suddenly
   left them, they realized the truth of His new commandment, and their
   love became consciously deeper, more intimate, really new love.

   And this new love is the fruit of the Holy Spirit dwelling in the
   Church. It is like the difference between carrying water with great
   exertion from a distant fountain, and having a stream from that
   fountain flow by one's own door, from which he can drink copiously, by
   whose invigorating scent he feels his spirits revived, into which he
   can throw himself for a refreshing bath. The Holy Spirit comes with
   glorious blessings to the children of God under the New Covenant. They
   drink, not with scant measure, but from a full and overflowing cup.
   They revel in the fulness of eternal Love, And He that creates this
   blessedness is the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, whom Jesus has sent from
   the Father.

  Organically One.

   "From whom the whole body, fitly joined together and compacted, maketh
   increase unto the edifying of itself in love." --Ephes. iv. 16.

   The newness of holy Love lies in the Church. As we look at the withered
   state of the Church in almost every period, we almost hesitate to make
   this statement; yet in principle we maintain it to its fullest extent
   and power.

   The Church of Christ on earth is like an "incluse." The "inclusi" were
   honorable men and women who in the Middle Ages immured themselves in
   little cells of stone, built under the street, just high enough to
   allow a man to stand erect. After the incluse had descended into his
   cell, it was closed over him with a grating, and thus he spent his
   lonely, comfortless life in voluntary isolation. Passers-by could see
   but little of him. Through the grating the faint outline of a dark form
   was dimly visible; but it did not seem to possess the least attraction;
   did not once suggest what manly and noble stature might be concealed in
   that cell; much less what extraordinary power might be embodied in that
   incluse, and what hours and days were spent in inward conflict. And
   such is the image of the Church of Christ on earth. It is enclosed and
   can not reveal itself. Of its real form only a faint outline appears,
   almost always unfavorable and unprepossessing. Unless its spiritual
   wealth and nobility are discovered in some other way, no one will
   surmise that this is the Church which shall one day decide the destiny
   of heaven and earth.

   Still this is the fact. The Father loves the Son. The body of the Son
   is the Church. Hence no one can be saved but he who is incorporated
   into His body the Church.

   Surely it requires a great stretch of the imagination to believe that
   this muddy shell of the visible Church contains such a precious pearl;
   but the initiated believe it. They know that in this respect the Church
   resembles its glorious Head, in the days of His flesh; of whom it was
   said: "When we shall see Him there is no beauty that we should desire
   Him. He is despised and rejected of men; we hid, as it were, our faces
   from Him; He was despised and we esteemed Him not." (Isa. liii. 3) And
   when Herod's soldiers mocked and shamefully entreated Him, when
   stripped and dying He moaned upon the cross, "I thirst," no one but
   those who looked beneath the surface could surmise that this man was
   the Lord of Glory. And yet so He proved to be. "He received beauty for
   ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the
   spirit of heaviness." (Isa. lxi. 3) And so it may be said of the Church
   while an earth. When we see her, there is no beauty that we should
   desire her; she is despised and rejected. Every one is, as it were,
   hiding his face from her. Still, she is the Lamb's Bride-elect; and the
   holy Church, which without spot or wrinkle shall one day be presented
   to the heavenly Bridegroom, is concealed within her. And therefore holy
   Love must celebrate its triumph in the Church.

   The newness of the commandment, "Love one another," consists in the
   fact that, being freed from the bonds of the Jewish national character,
   love can effectually operate in the Church. And tho it be objected a
   thousand times that love is nowhere a greater stranger than in the
   Church, and that rather strife and division, backbiting and devouring
   one another, always have seemed to be the order of the day, yet this
   lamentable fact does not alter the foregoing positive statement.

   It should be remembered, in the first place, that strife and division
   assume the fiercest aspect among those that are most closely related;
   between brothers and sisters they are more serious than between
   strangers. Cain and Abel were too intimately connected. This is why
   differences between husband and wife leave such deep and painful
   impressions. Their mutual love can not treat the matter lightly. It is
   the very intimacy of the relation that gives the difference such a
   serious character.

   Secondly, we should not forget that even in the Church strife and
   division make the loudest noise, while love unseen quietly pursues its
   way. Among the initiated in the Church there ever has been a communion
   of soul which has nowhere its equal--an attachment and opening of
   hearts impossible but in the Christian life; a brotherly love so sweet
   as to surpass every other love.

   And finally, for the present time these discords must continue, that in
   the last day the beauty and symmetry of the structure may appear to
   highest advantage. During the construction of a palace one looks in
   vain for symmetry; the eye meets but disproportions and jarring
   contrasts. It can not be otherwise. Confusion there must be until the
   work is completed. Then the pure and perfect symmetry of the whole will
   be seen and admired. To call for it during the time of the building
   would make the final beauty impossible. It would be no profit, but
   loss. It would spoil the work. Perfect agreement of the parts, finished
   and unfinished, is out of the question so long as the whole work is not
   completed. Until then perfect harmony is a matter of faith, not of
   sight. This is why the saint can say, not, I see, but, "I believe in,
   the Holy, Catholic, Christian Church."

   This is caused by another separating element in the Church antagonizing
   love, viz., the truth. This is evident from the apostolic word warning
   us against sentimental love, saying: "That we be no more children, but,
   doing the truth (Dutch Translation) in love, we grow up in all things
   unto Him who is the Head, even Christ" (Ephes. iv. 15).

   What are we to understand by truth opposing love? Are not both from the
   same source?

   Love is union; it joins and binds together severed parts that belong
   together. And this may be done in two ways. The easiest way to match
   two non-fitting cogwheels is to remove the teeth; then their faces will
   cover each other. A much more difficult way is to file each tooth to
   the required size. Let us apply this to love. To make the wheels fit
   each other by removing the teeth is undoubtedly a work of love; for now
   the wheels are perfectly matched, they seem to be of one piece. But the
   truth is lost; the wheels are no longer cogwheels. The teeth which made
   them so are missing. It is true, to fit them by filing each tooth to
   the right size requires inexhaustible patience, but it retains the
   truth; the wheels remain cogwheels; even tho love, which is the
   matching of the wheels, comes slowly, i.e., not until the last tooth is
   filed to its proper size.

   The love which ought to reign among God's people is not the excitement
   of a dreamy, mystic feeling, destroying individuality; but such uniting
   and knitting together of the elect that each can attain the full
   measure of his individual growth ordained for him in the divine
   counsel; so that in this completion the glory of their membership in
   the same body may appear and be tasted in the blessed consciousness of
   the most tender and intimate union.

   This is contained in Ephes. iv. 16: "From which the whole body fitly
   framed together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth,
   according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
   increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love." In the first
   place, the apostle does full justice to the divine ordinance and honors
   the divine disposition in the "joining together" and "Compacting "and
   "joints of supply"; and then, by this clearly defined path, he returns
   with the words, "To the edifying of itself in love," to the deep
   mystery of this holy intimacy.

   It is easy to cultivate love without regarding the truth. It requires
   neither conflict nor exertion. We simply file down every rough place
   and rub away every wrinkle; and at last nothing remains to oppose love.
   But in that way the Lord's disposition is simply set aside, His
   ordinance made of no effect, and His truth stumbles in the street. But
   if you acknowledge the truth and the divine counsel and disposition; if
   you do not cavil at the divine ordinance and arrangement; if you do not
   plane, file, and level, but seek the union of spirits in such a way
   that together they form a whole, so that the teeth of the wheels always
   clasp each other--then the cultivation of love meets many more
   obstacles and requires infinitely more care and labor. But finally it
   will be crowned with the glorious success of obtaining love without
   sacrificing divine truth.

   Or to express it more comprehensively: God Himself is the greatest
   obstacle in the way of that quickly grown and immature love. If God did
   not exist, two seriously minded men could be made to agree much more
   easily. Then they would be at liberty to dispose and arrange matters to
   suit themselves, according to their own choice. But God exists; hence
   the disposition of things must be according to His choice. In the
   covenant of love between two persons He is always the Third, and claims
   that He and His name be not sacrificed to their mutual love. Hence all
   the conflict, difficulty; and vexation of spirit. Among God's people
   love in whatever form is ever subject to the first and greatest
   commandment: God first and last. This is why it is not lawful to
   cherish and cultivate an affection which excludes His love. In their
   mutual affection they may not ignore God; act as tho God did not exist;
   be indifferent to His name and truth as tho they were of little account
   and their mutual love the principal thing.

   Nay, the wisdom which is from above is first pure, then peaceable.
   Mutual love among the saints can not flourish unless the saint
   acknowledge God, confess His name, exalt His truth as their shield and
   buckler; praise His virtues and reverence His counsel, especially
   regarding their own person and destiny. Christian love, new and
   unfailing, born here to live forever; can scintillate only where the
   name of the Lord shines forth in His truth, where that truth, bearing
   and animating souls, is experienced and confessed. And this exists, not
   in sentimentalism, wheedling tones, or sinful indulgence, but in being
   united and knit together by the Holy Spirit according to the divine
   foreordination.

   At this point the work of the Holy Spirit returns to the eternal
   counsel of the Lord Jehovah. From that counsel it flows; in that
   counsel every life has its starting-point, and to that counsel every
   completed development must return, impelled from its own internal
   pressure. Every development, tho adorning itself with fairest names,
   which opposes that counsel, proceeds in a wrong direction, and must
   change its course or run into eternal death. That which is to receive
   consistency, endurance, and eternal, inexhaustible fulness must spring
   from that counsel, and in the end, with reference to itself, correctly
   reflect its fulness.

   And since in that counsel the parts do not lie loose, side by side, but
   are destined to form one rich, spiritual whole, it is the Holy Spirit
   who, by fitly joining together these parts--i.e., the elect children of
   God--unites and knits them together according to that counsel. Only
   when this is accomplished, love's perfect beauty shall appear. Then the
   Church of Christ shall shine as the bearer of that love in the presence
   of the Lord. And then only the Holy Spirit, even the Spirit of Truth,
   shall have finished His greatest work--that of the cultivation of Love.

  The Hardening Operation of Love.

   "Being grieved for the hardness of their heart."--Mark iii. 5.

   Love may also be reversed. Failing to cherish, to uplift, and to
   enrich, it consumes and destroys. This is a mystery which man can not
   fathom. It belongs to the unsearchable depths of the divine Being, of
   which we do not wish to know more than has been revealed. But this does
   not alter the fact.

   No creature can exclude itself from the divine control. No man can say
   that he has nothing to do with God; that he or any other creature
   exists independent of God; for God upholds, bears, and carries him from
   moment to moment, giving him life and power and all his faculties. Even
   Satan is not self-existing. If it pleased God to discontinue his
   existence, he would cease from being. Satan and all his demons and all
   flesh live and move and have their being in God. This apostolic word
   does not signify an intimate, acquaintance with the secret of the Lord,
   but is merely the clear and sober statement of every creature's
   essential relation to the Creator. Whether sinner or saint, angel in
   heaven or demon in hell, even plant or animal, each lives, moves, and
   exists in God.

   Hence to withdraw oneself from God is utterly impossible. Psalm cxxxix.
   is not merely a sketch of the divine omnipresence, but much more; in
   holy sense, a testimony and confession from the very root of man's
   being, of the creature's absolute inability to withdraw himself from
   God's active control. The misery of the lost in hell consists in the
   fact that in their unholy and wicked hearts they are subject to the
   active, divine control. The cry which once escaped from moaning lips,
   "Let me alone before I go hence" (Job xx. 21), is the presentment of
   the unavoidable control of God, which overwhelms the ungodly as a
   calamitous flood. If God would let them alone, there would be no hell
   and no misery. The unquenchable fire would be quenched, and the worm
   would die. But He does not let them alone. He continues His hold upon
   them. And this causes the eternal pain, and overwhelms them with
   destruction and condemnation forever.

   It is represented sometimes as tho God's material dealings were to be
   continued with every man, whether good or evil, while His spiritual
   dealings are confined to the elect. But this is a mistake. It is true
   His sun rises upon the good and the evil, and His rain comes down upon
   the just and the unjust; but the same is true spiritually: There is
   this difference, however, that while the just and the unjust are both
   profited by the rain and sunshine, the radiation of the Sun of
   Righteousness and the rain of grace result in blessing for the elect
   and in destruction for the lost.

   This is clearly illustrated by the effects of the rays of the sun in
   nature. In March they melt the snow and warm and fertilize the soil,
   while in August they harden the field and scorch its fruit. This is
   caused by the field's too close proximity to the sun in summer, while
   in spring it occupies the right position in relation to the sun. And
   this applies to the Sun of Righteousness. Standing in the proper
   position regarding that Sun, one feels its fostering and fertilizing
   effects; but forsaking that position through self-exaltation, aspiring
   to loftier heights, he discovers immediately that the Sun of
   Righteousness no longer can bless him, but must consume him with divine
   fire.

   The Scripture teaches this fearful truth in various, ways and under
   various images. St. Paul says that the same Gospel is to one a savor of
   life unto life, and to another a savor of death unto death. Concerning
   the holy Infant, Simeon prophesies that He is set for the fall and
   rising again of many in Israel; and the prophet declares that to the
   saints Messiah shall be a rock of defense, and to those who forsake
   their God He shall be an offense and a stone of stumbling. There are
   branches apparently on the same vine: yet some are cast into the fire,
   and others blossom and bear much fruit. It is one clay and the same
   potter; yet from the same lump are formed a vessel of honor and a
   vessel of dishonor; but in both cases it is the same power.

   The Scripture introduces this operation unto death and destruction with
   the somber word; "hardening of heart"; especially when the hardening is
   the result of resisting eternal Love,

   Not every effect, however, of the divine operation, destructive to the
   sinner, is in itself a hardening of heart. There is also a mere "giving
   up," or "letting alone." This is followed by the more gloomy
   "darkening." And only then comes the deadly operation in its proper and
   limited sense, "hardening of heart," in its worst and most fearful
   degree.

   The mildest and yet awful form of this destruction consists in the fact
   that, according to the testimony of the apostle, the Lord gives the
   impenitent sinner over to a reprobate mind: "Wherefore God gave them up
   to uncleanness; who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped
   and served the creature more than the Creator" (Rom. i. 24, 25). Again
   he declares in verse 26: "For this cause God gave them up unto vile
   affections." And for the third time in verse 28: "And as they did not
   like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a
   reprobate mind, to do things that are not convenient, being filled with
   all unrighteousness."

   This "giving up" is related to the "darkening," of which St. Paul
   speaks in the same connection (ver. 21): "They became vain in their
   imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened." In Rom. xi. 8, he
   describes the same thing in the words of Isaiah: "God hath given them
   the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, ears that they
   should not hear." Thus the "darkening" and "the spirit of slumber" are
   the gradual transitions between the "being given over to a reprobate
   mind" and the "hardening of heart" in its proper sense.

   When a sinner is given over to a reprobate mind, the Lord allows him
   the desire of his heart. He had opened for him another way; but the
   sinful heart's desires and inclinations bend in a different direction.
   At first, divine Love, watching over him, prevents him from gratifying
   these desires. And for this he would thank God, if his heart were
   right. But he murmurs at this loving interference of his heavenly
   Father, and seeks the means to obtain what God so far denies him. A
   painful tension is the result: on the one hand, the sinner bent upon
   the execution of his evil intentions; and on the other, God, who
   temporarily prevents this by withholding the opportunity. But when the
   sinner persists in his evil course and sears his conscience, then God
   finally withdraws His loving care; the tension ceases; He lets the
   sinner have his desire; and the latter, given over to a reprobate mind,
   revels in the gratification of his unholy passions; and, instead of
   mourning in repentance before the holy God, enjoys his victory.

   However, even from this awful condition return is possible. For the
   first joy of victory is followed by a positive and painful feeling of
   disappointment. Surely he has conquered, but his conquest is
   unsatisfactory: first, because every sinful gratification alarms the
   conscience, and this is misery to the soul; secondly, because unholy
   pleasure is always exhausting and disappointing, never yields what it
   promised, never proves to be what first it seemed. In such moments
   salvation is still possible. Better feelings may be aroused, and may
   lead the sinner to realize that God is right and loves him better than
   he loves himself. And, acknowledging that God is right, he may cease to
   justify himself. Then salvation's gates are open, and he may not be far
   from the heavenly kingdom.

   But, overcoming the feeling of disappointment, he falls immediately
   into a deeper depth. Then he explains his feelings in the opposite way:
   disappointed not because he has already drank too deeply from the cup
   of sin, but not deeply enough. He acknowledges his disappointment, but
   he fancies that greater boldness in sin will remedy this. And so comes
   the turning-point. When the fearful thought is once conceived and
   admitted, and the heart's demon-like desire has sprung up deeply and
   systematically to revel in sin's pleasures, then he is lost.  Then "the
   vain imagination and darkening of a foolish heart "is added to being "
   given over to a reprobate mind." Then the spirit of slumber takes
   possession of him. He can no longer discern the real cause of his
   dissatisfaction and disappointment. Sin intoxicates him more and more.
   And the more he indulges the greater his blindness for the
   consequences. Things lose their forms. The phenomenal take the place of
   the real. He has eyes, but not for the real and the true; ears, but not
   for the voice of the eternal Speaker. And so he rushes on from one sin
   to another; dissatisfied with sin, yet thirsting after more. As St.
   Paul says, even anxious to see others sin.

   In the way of salvation it is "Grace for grace"; but in the way of sin,
   it is sin for sin. To stand still is impossible. The path inclines.

   Thus God lets the sinner go. He intoxicates him so that he does not see
   the precipice that yawns before him. And this opens the way for the
   hardening. Every effort to make such a one the subject of saving grace
   is like casting pearls before swine; then Immanuel must hide His love,
   that seeing he see not, and hearing he understand not.

  The Love Which Withers.

   "Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will
   He hardeneth."--Rom. ix. 18.

   The idea of hardening is so awful that, with all its unsanctified pity
   and natural religion, the human heart rejects it as a horrible thought.
   Natural compassion can not bear the idea that a fellow man, instigated
   to evil by it, should forever ruin himself. And natural religion can
   not conceive of a God who, instead of persuading His creature to
   virtue, should give him up and incite him to sin. This entire
   representation of hardening is in such open and irreconcilable conflict
   with all the feelings of the human heart that it is impossible to
   suppose that it originated in the human mind.

   When as children we heard of this hardening of heart for the first
   time, we could not receive it. Our whole nature rose up against it. And
   later on, when, in connection with this doctrine, we heard of the
   mysterious imprecatory psalms and of an unavoidable, eternal doom, then
   our human nature rebelled against these fearful things with such
   irrepressible force that we preferred temporarily to forsake our
   confession rather than to be forced to accept such a horrible idea.
   Wherefore skeptics are right when they say that, to prove the
   inconsistency of the Scripture, its miracles need not be attacked, for
   that its doctrine of hardening and cursing antagonizes the claims of
   the heart even more than the doctrine of miracles opposes the claims of
   the reason.

   Hence the opposition against the Sacred Scripture always proceeds from
   two sides at once: on the one hand, from coldly intellectual minds that
   are always shocked at the Scripture's so-called absurdities and
   impossibilities; and on the other hand, from the emotional folk, whose
   feelings are ever hurt by Holy Writ. The effort to compromise can never
   satisfy any one. To say, "To me the Scripture is God's own precious
   Word; but when I come to the 'imprecatory Psalms' and the 'hardening of
   heart,' then I simply close my eyes and hold my tongue," is no position
   at all, but mere self-contradiction.

   And yet it should be remembered that the vast majority of Christians
   lose themselves in this unfortunate half-heartedness. The
   Arminian-tinted do this consciously; wilfully they erect their Dagon of
   the free will as often as the testimony of the Ark of the Covenant has
   cast him down. They are a singular people. When a doubter refuses to
   believe the Godhead of Christ, they are immediately ready with their
   Bible to prove from this text, that passage, and these recorded facts
   that Christ must be the Son of God and therefore God Himself. But when,
   with reference to the doctrine of salvation, one proves to them from
   the same Bible, with similar texts, passages, and facts, that there is
   indeed a hardening of heart wrought at times by God Himself, then there
   is no end to their contradiction and they refuse to submit themselves
   to the Word. They do not seem to notice the unreasonableness and
   dishonesty of this course. It only shows that, when people propose to
   decide arbitrarily which portion of the Scripture is true and which is
   spurious, they betray inward disloyalty and a culpable lack of
   conviction.

   For it is either the Scripture which decides what is true, or I decide.
   If it is the Scripture, then I must accept its statements concerning
   the Godhead of the Lord Jesus and of the hardening of the heart. But if
   I decide according to my own ideas, then I presume to make myself a
   judge of the Scripture, and, in the very nature of the case, its
   authority as being a divine and absolute testimony fails to affect me.

   We do not stop to consider those who deny the hardening wilfully. They
   have departed from the Scripture and from the divine truth. But we
   notice those who practically deny this doctrine, partly by ignoring it,
   partly by refusing to acknowledge it as part of their confession
   relating to the divine Being. They rehearse the Scriptural statements
   regarding this doctrine faithfully and correctly; if need be, they are
   ready to defend, rather than for the sake of human sensitiveness to
   deny it. On the contrary, their orthodoxy even on this point is above
   reproach. What the Scripture teaches they teach, the doctrine of the
   hardening included. But they only rehearse it. They know not how to use
   it. It leaves them cold; they are not in touch with it. While they
   never neglect to give it a place in their inventory, they do not work
   with it. And this is the serious part of their position, for it is
   inconsistent. He who treats holy things honestly and sincerely must
   consider that the acceptance or rejection of this doctrine necessarily
   affects his representation of the divine Being. The representation of
   our own heart naturally excludes the hardening. From this it follows
   that the God of Scripture who effects the hardening, and from whom it
   can not be separated, does not agree with our heart's representation of
   Himself, and therefore requires that we adopt another.

   And this is the difficulty with these practical doubters. While they
   record the doctrine as a memorial in their books, they never apply it:
   partly because they never consider the fearfulness of the thought, and
   therefore speak of it unfeelingly; partly--and this deserves special
   attention--because they never consider how the earnest confession of
   the doctrine necessarily affects their representation of the divine
   Being.

   This last point is of greatest importance. According to the
   representation of our natural heart, it is immaterial who or what God
   is really and essentially if He only loves us, whatever we are, and to
   such extent as ever to restore what we destroy. Hence God Himself is of
   no account. Man is the principal thing; and the highest aim of divine
   love is to bring man sooner or later to the highest enjoyment of bliss,
   whatever his conduct, even tho to his last breath he should kick
   against the pricks. Such a God would exactly suit us: a God without a
   character; who in matters great and small counts for nothing; who by
   reason of His ill-proportioned love is insensible to any insult that we
   may offer Him. Hence, however wicked a man may be, however insolent his
   treatment of the Holy One, the good and benevolent Father will find a
   way eventually to lead him to eternal bliss; if not in this life, then
   in the life to come. From that follows that in proportion as God
   decreases, in that proportion His love increases. His love will be
   perfect and all-excelling only when He Himself becomes nothing and
   utterly discounts Himself.

   Such representation of God is the result of a natural process. To man,
   love means self-denial and self-sacrifice. He is egotistic; and love
   can not have full sway within and around him unless he first deny
   himself, count himself nothing, mindful only of the neighbor's needs.
   His human love requires that he more and more ignore himself, and make
   the salvation of others the only object of his existence. And since
   love so works in him, he imagines that it must so work in God.
   Unconsciously he applies to God the same human conception of love; and
   finally he fancies that the love of God rises higher and higher as His
   grace becomes more universal.

   When one may say that there can be no sinner so wicked and dishonorable
   but divine Love will eventually receive him in perfect felicity, and
   another, "You are right, altho I would make Judas and those like him an
   exception," then the former appears the more plausible. He alone who
   includes even Judas among the blessed has the most worthy idea of the
   Love of God. The least doubt about it disparages that Love. And the
   measure of that disparagement is determined by his estimate both of the
   numbers of the blessed and of the lost.

   The point at issue is the Being of God. If the human conception of love
   is applied to God, then all men must be saved, and God has no right to
   be anything in relation to the creature. But if we confess that of all
   beings God is the Source, to whom therefore the conception of
   creaturely love can not be applied, for then He would cease from being
   the Supreme Being, then the whole objection becomes invalid. For then
   we ignore our own ideas concerning this mystery, and acknowledge that
   they can not but lead us astray. We also distrust the teachings of
   others, knowing that no more their heart than our own can teach us
   anything in this respect. And, from the nature of the case, we are made
   to see that on this subject God alone can enlighten us.

   Hence either we must deny that there is a revelation concerning divine
   Love, so that therefore we can neither deny nor confirm anything
   concerning it; or we must confess that the Scripture offers us such
   revelation, and then must also acknowledge as true all that Scripture
   teaches regarding it.

   We do not deny that we ourselves feel the antagonizing influence of the
   doctrine, and we confess that it does not at all agree with our
   creaturely conception of love. Neither skeptic nor Arminian need remind
   us of it. We are much too human and free and untrammeled to deny it.
   But we absolutely deny our own heart and feelings the right to decide
   this matter, or even to have any voice in it, and claim that we and our
   opponents should unreservedly submit to all that God in His Word has
   revealed in this respect.

   While the human heart contends that God can not harden any man's heart,
   Scripture meets us, whether we like it or not, with the awful
   testimony: "And whom He will He hardens." And let us reverently believe
   it, tho it be with inward trembling of soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXXIII.

  The Hardening in the Sacred Scripture.

   "He hath hardened their heart."-- John xii. 40.

   The Scripture teaches positively that the hardening and "darkening of
   their foolish heart" is a divine, intentional act.

   This is plainly evident from God's charge to Moses concerning the king
   of Egypt: "Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and I will harden
   Pharaoh's heart, and multiply My signs and wonders in the land of
   Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not harken unto you, and I will lay My hand
   upon Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord" (Exod.
   vii. 3-5). Before this the Lord had said to Moses: "When thou goest to
   return unto Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
   which I have put in thine hand; but I will make his heart stubborn,
   that he shall not let the people go" (Exod. iv. 21).

   The principal person in the Scripture in whom this awful truth obtains
   its clearest revelation is Pharaoh. Why in him we can not tell. And,
   instead of looking down on him from the heights of our own imagined
   piety, we should rather remember the word of the apostle: "And whom He
   will He hardens."

   However, the subject of this terrible judgment of hardening is not the
   individual Pharaoh in his private life, but the king, the mighty prince
   and sovereign, the ruler and despot, who in the majesty of his crown
   and scepter represented the supremacy of the first great world-empire
   over the nations of the earth.

   In those days Egypt occupied the position subsequently attained by
   Nineveh, Babylon, Macedonia, and Rome; it was the embodiment of all the
   luster and glory which the natural, sinful, and God-rejecting world
   could create. In the cities of Upper and Lower Egypt men reveled in the
   refined pleasures of life. From all the surrounding countries gold came
   pouring into Egypt. The rulers built themselves great cities and strong
   fortresses, sphinxes and mountain-like pyramids. Cities of the dead
   were hewn out of the rocks. Magnificent sarcophagi were chiseled out of
   exquisitely beautiful marble. In a word, the world's proud and majestic
   creations of those days were found on the shores of the Nile. The
   Pharaoh of Egypt was the mightiest man of the earth.

   And as such he is the subject of the hardening. That St. Paul views the
   conflict between Jehovah and Pharaoh in this light is evident from his
   quotation of Exod. ix. 16, where it is expressed in strongest and
   plainest language: "For I will at this time send all My plagues upon
   thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou
   mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth. And in very
   deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show in thee My
   power; and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth" (Rom.
   ix. 11).

   These words are meaningless if they are made to refer to the private
   life of the individual Pharaoh. No private individual ever possessed
   such power. But if they are understood as referring to Pharaoh the
   great world-ruler, they assume an entirely different aspect. For he was
   not the creator of that power, neither was that power the creation of a
   day, but the result of a gradual development under God's own direction.
   Four centuries before Moses, God had already spoken to Abraham of this
   mighty Egypt and predicted the conflict which His power would bring
   upon it. Many dynasties of absolute monarchs had succeeded one another.
   And when Pharaoh's dynasty ascended the throne, the centralized
   government of the empire was thoroughly vested in his person.

   In His unfathomable counsel the Lord had evidently led the godless
   world of that day to concentrate all its wisdom, power, intellect, and
   refinement in Egypt's limited territory. Himself had raised up Egypt,
   Himself had raised up its great dynasties, and lastly raised up
   Pharaoh, who, wholly absorbed into Egypt's luxury, power, and
   world-majesty, was the embodiment of what the world could oppose in one
   man, and he therefore a man of sin, against the majesty of God.

   And this haughty monarch enclosed Israel in the bonds of death, and
   with them the Hope of the fathers, the preparation of Messiah after the
   flesh, and the Church of God in its patriarchal state. He should have
   honored and blessed this people, but he treated it cruelly. The
   sciences of those days flourished in Egypt. Historical events were
   chiseled in hieroglyphs upon stone, and published upon obelisks and
   sarcophagi for the information of the public. Hence Egypt could not
   plead ignorance as an excuse; at the royal court Joseph was still
   remembered as the benefactor of Egypt, who saved it from famine; and
   the Egyptians could not have forgotten their solemn promises to the
   Hebrews. And yet Pharaoh tyrannized over the people, and even sought to
   prevent their increase by ordering the destruction of all male infants.

   Hence Pharaoh, enslaving Israel, represents the evil world-power which
   kept the Christ in bondage. Wherefore God said: "I have called My Son
   out of Egypt." With Israel He called the Messiah out of Egypt. The
   fearful conflict was for Messiah against Pharaoh.

   This sheds some light upon the puzzling words: "For this cause have I
   raised thee up." Having lost its prop by its departure from God, the
   world could not manifest its sinful power but in a world-empire, and in
   individual monarchs. And such manifestation was not fortuitous, but a
   logical necessity, divinely intended, that the divine power might
   triumph over it. For this reason it is repeatedly stated: "But the Lord
   hardened Pharaoh's heart" (Exod. x. 20); "And I will harden Pharaoh's
   heart, that he shall follow after them, and I will be honored upon
   Pharaoh and upon his host, that the Egyptians may know that I am the
   Lord" (Exod. xiv. 4); "And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and
   he pursued after the children of Israel" (Exod. xiv. 8). Later on the
   hardening came upon all Egypt: "And I, behold, I will make stubborn the
   hearts of the Egyptians, and I will get Me honor upon pharaoh and upon
   all his host" (Exod. xiv. 17).

   Throughout this whole terrible history the prospective hardening is
   first announced, then carried into effect, and finally, recorded as
   accomplished in Pharaoh. For--and this deserves special notice--every
   announcement of the divine hardening is followed by the announcement
   from the subjective standpoint that Pharaoh himself hardened his
   heart:"And Pharaoh's heart was stubborn" (Exod. vii. 13); and again:
   "And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments, and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened" [38] (Exod. vii. 13); and again: "And
   Pharaoh's heart was stubborn; neither would he let the children of
   Israel go" (Exod. ix. 35). And for this reason St. Paul writes: "Is
   there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For He saith to Moses, I
   will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not
   of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
   mercy. For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
   have I raised thee up, that I might show My power in thee" (Rom. ix.
   14-17).

   Altho Pharaoh is the most conspicuous figure in this respect, yet the
   hardening is not confined to him alone. Of Sihon, the feared despot of
   Hesbon, it is written: "The Lord thy God hardened his spirit and made
   his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thine hand, as
   appeareth this day." (Deut. 2:30) Of the allied kings of North
   Palestine, who under Jabin, king of Hazor, declared war against Joshua,
   it is written: "For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that
   they should come against Israel in battle" (Joshua xi. 20).

   Satan said that he tempted David to number the people (1 Chron. xxi.
   1); but, from 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, it is evident that he did not act without
   divine direction and obeyed only reluctantly.

   The prophet mournfully asks: "O Lord, why hast Thou made us to err from
   Thy ways and hardened our hearts from Thy fear?" (Isa. lxiii. 17); a
   touching complaint which echoes the awful prophecy of his installation:
   "Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed but understand not, and see ye
   indeed but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat and make
   their heart heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes
   and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and convert
   and be healed" (Isa. vi. 9, 10).

   To the objection that this is Old-Testament theology, but that such
   harshness is foreign to the Christian Church in which Christ has
   instituted the reign of Love, we reply that that Church is as old as
   Paradise, that in both covenants it is the same divine Speaker, and
   that Christ and His apostles reveal the same hardening. In Matt. xiii.
   14, Mark iv. 12, 14, Luke viii. 10, Christ largely dwells upon the
   fact, and states it, even for the direction of conduct, in the very
   words of Isaiah's inauguration prophecy, that sometimes God causes the
   Word to come to a man in such a way that hearing he hears not, but
   hardens his heart. And St. Paul addressed the same words to the Romans
   (Acts xxviii. 26; x. 8). We have already noticed his words, "To give
   over to a reprobate mind," and to the darkening of heart, which have
   the same effect as the hardening. It is remarkable that the New
   Testament especially presents the idea of hardening in a passive form,
   not as an act of the subjects themselves, but as a calamity which has
   come upon them as a terrible consequence of their sins. In Rom. xi. 25
   it reads: "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of
   this mystery, that a hardening in part is happened to Israel"; in 2
   Cor. iii. 14: "But their minds were hardened"; in Rom. xi. 7, "And the
   rest were hardened." So also in Mark vi. 52: "Their heart was
   hardened"; in Acts xix. 9: "But divers were hardened"; and lastly in
   Heb. iii. 13: "But exhort one another while it is called to-day; lest
   any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."

   With these passages before us, it is impossible to deny that the
   Scripture reveals God as the Author of the hardening. And he who says
   that the God whom he worships can not harden any man's heart, ought to
   see that he does not worship the God of the Scripture.

   The objection that if hardening is a divine operation, then warning and
   admonition are vain and useless, points to another extreme. The same
   Scripture which says, "And whom He will He hardeneth," (Rom. ix. 18)
   says also, "But exhort one another while it is called to-day, lest any
   of you be hardened." (Heb. iii. 13) To both these passages we submit,
   bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the Word.

  Temporary Hardening.

   "Lord, why hast Thou hardened our heart? "--Isa. lxiii. 17.

   That there is a hardening of heart which culminates in the sin against
   the Holy Spirit can not be denied. When dealing with spiritual things
   we must take account of it; for it is one of the most fearful
   instruments of the divine wrath. For, whether we say that Satan or
   David or the Lord tempted the king, it amounts to the same thing. The
   cause is always in man's sin; and in each of these three cases the
   destructive fatality whereby sin poisons and destroys the soul can not
   be severed from the government of God.

   However, in studying this matter, we should remember for our own
   comfort that the hardening is not essentially and invariably absolute
   and irreparable. We should distinguish between a temporary and a
   permanent hardening. The latter is absolute; the former passes away and
   dissolves into saving faith.

   Crying, "Lord, why hast Thou hardened our heart?" Isaiah represents
   persons who are now in glory before the throne; moreover, the question
   itself, the sorrow expressed, and the longing after God of which it
   speaks, suffice to assure us that Isaiah was no Pharaoh. That Israel is
   exhorted, "Harden not your hearts as in the provocation" (Psalm xcv.
   8), proves that the hardening spoken of had not been intended forever.
   And the hardening that, according to St. Paul, had come "in part" to
   Israel was not absolute, as appears from the words "in part."

   The temporal and the permanent hardening should not be confounded. This
   would drive the guilty sinner into spiritual despair, and raise the
   Cain-thought in his heart--a danger that requires the most earnest and
   watchful care. Satan, the enemy of souls, thoroughly understands all
   the weaknesses of the human heart. In this respect he knows more than
   the best informed among men. He knows whether to attack a man in the
   front or from behind, to ruin him with threats or with flattery, to
   frighten him with despair or to ensnare him with the prospects of
   peace. This is why he delights again and again in making a man either
   trifle with the deadly danger of his soul, or to believe that he is
   hopelessly lost and beyond the power of redemption.

   How many souls has not Satan terrified with the sin against the Holy
   Spirit!--souls who never thought of such a thing; who, on the contrary,
   had a tender regard for the Holy Spirit's honor in the hope of their
   salvation, but whom nevertheless he decoyed into the fearful belief of
   being utterly cast away, of having committed the unpardonable sin. Of
   course, if such souls had lived nearer the Word, more earnestly
   searched it, and adhered more closely to the guidance of the Church's
   interpretation of this dark mystery, they would not have fallen into
   this snare. But as it was, Satan whispered it into their ear, and,
   almost smothering their spiritual life, kept them, sometimes for years,
   languishing in the mortal fear of being lost forever. And so dark was
   the spiritual night that it seemed that no ray of light would ever
   pierce it.

   And the same is true of the hardening. Even with this awful spiritual
   operation Satan plays his horrible game of robbing God's children of
   their spiritual peace. Of course, this is never without their own
   fault. All the spiritual distress of the saints is the necessary result
   of their transgressions, whether public or private. But he that sowed
   the hurtful seed, in the field fertilized by sin, was no other than the
   tempter of souls, who stealthily came to their side and suggested that
   their grievous state was worse than being merely "forsaken"; that there
   must be signs of hardening which would steadily increase; wherefore the
   flower of hope was withered and all expectation cut off.

   And for this danger the soul must be prepared by the clear and definite
   distinction between the temporary and the permanent hardening. The
   former comes to every one of God's children. There is not one, among
   those grown old in the way, who can not recall the time when he felt
   the love of God drawing him to separate him from some sin or unbelief;
   but this seemed only to incite him all the more to resist that love, to
   close his ears to it and with greater energy to embrace the evil. It
   was not with the intention to persist in it, but merely to gain time
   wherein to enjoy the sinful delights a little longer, while the divine
   love is resisted. We say: "Once more, and then we will stop our
   resistance." In reality, while we thus trifle with the love of God, we
   believe that it is quite strong enough to endure this little
   opposition.- And this may result in a temporary hardening, which is
   sometimes very serious, and which is marked by and consists in the fact
   that the saint who intended the next time to break with his sin, then
   discovers, to his dismay, that by his temporary indulgence the power to
   resist has been lost.

   And this is God's righteous reward. The love that the disobedient saint
   resisted for the sake of sin is insulted and refuses to be trifled
   with. Altho he did not expect it, yet by his obstinate resistance of
   that first love the power of sin was strengthened, the soul's tender
   sensitiveness was dulled, and the heart was made callous. What was
   first a mere sliver in the flesh became a malignant boil. An evil power
   developed itself imperceptibly and unexpectedly. He fights against it,
   but in vain. After repeated falls, he ceases the fight, and gradually
   lapses into a condition of hardening so grievous that he can not
   discover in his heart the least trace of the divine love.

   However, this hardening is only partial, for it has reference only to
   some special matter; and this is the difference between it and the
   permanent hardening. Apart from this matter, he can still burn with
   love and zeal for his God; he can still open his heart for the
   operation of the gracious powers of eternal life, and even have blessed
   communion with the Lord. But these slowly disappear. The malignant
   abscess gradually imparts its fever-heat from one part to another. The
   blood in the veins of the soul is kept in restless tension, and to this
   partial hardening is added a sense of general forsakenness that causes
   his communion to become more rare and less refreshing. There may be an
   occasional drop of oil, but there is never a full, fresh anointing. As
   a result, he feels himself poor, dry, and dead; he goes about with the
   sentence of condemnation in his conscience; but in the midst of his
   anguish his soul groans unto God.

   And the Lord hears that groan. There may be no prayer, and the Holy
   Spirit may be too far gone to enable his soul to pour itself out in
   supplications; yet so long as there is a smoking flax and a broken reed
   that vainly tries to lift itself, so long as there is a sense of shame
   and an inward groan to God for deliverance, the Lord inclines His ear,
   full of compassion, and the hour approaches when the Sun of
   Righteousness shall dispel the clouds and melt the hardness of his
   heart. The love first resisted now returns with irresistible power to
   gladden his soul. The crust of ice begins to melt. A blessed emotion
   unknown for years makes itself felt. The dry eye becomes dim and the
   inflexible knee and stiff neck bend in prayer. And the mercy and
   long-suffering of God cause the fresh oil to flow, and, with a
   self-abasement hitherto unknown, the soul believes and praises and
   adores once more the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the rich mercy
   of His God.

   Altho a real hardening, yet it is like that which falls upon the
   streams and fields in winter, when the yellow leaves fall from the
   trees, the sun-rays slant, and the waters congeal. But that winter does
   not last forever. Spring is coming soon. And when the grass is green
   again and the birds sing in the woods, it seems as tho, after its
   winter sleep, nature is quickened into a richer and more glorious life.
   Such is the temporal hardening of the called of God: a winter followed
   by spring, until the dawn of the eternal morning in the realms of the
   everlasting light.

   But the permanent, the eternal hardening is not so. This causes us to
   think of the world of eternal snow and ice in the polar regions, where
   it freezes never to thaw, and where nature is covered with somber
   cerements, to be uncovered only when the Lord shall come upon the
   clouds, and the whole world shall melt with fervent heat.

   It is true, even amid that eternal snow and ice, a singly ray may for a
   while pierce the darkness, the icicles may drop, and the ice-fields may
   separate; but the heart of that ice-world remains unaffected and its
   eternal foundations unmoved. One iceberg may get loose from the rest,
   but it remains an iceberg. It can not thaw out; eternally hardened,
   even in nature!

   And that world of ice is the awful image of the Sihons and Pharaohs,
   and of every one who is permanently hardened and given over to the
   judgment of God. The Love of God has been sinned against forever, and
   every expression of life only adds to the callousness of the heart,
   until all feeling, conception, and sensibility with reference to
   spiritual things are utterly gone. And if there be any life and growth
   left, they are the life and growth of the mildew which poisons, of the
   parasite which destroys. So fearful is the hardening that the subject
   himself is utterly insensible of it. In his temporal hardening the
   child of God shall weep at last; but the other moves on with boisterous
   laughter to meet his doom.

   The Lord God have mercy on us! God's judgment of hardening is such an
   awful thing!

  XXXV.

  The Hardening of Nations.

   "The election hath obtained it, and the rest were hardened."-- Rom. xi.
   7.

   St. Paul's word, at the head of this article, is strikingly impressive,
   and its content exceedingly rich and instructive. It clearly announces
   the fact that the hardening is not exceptional or occasional, but
   universal, affecting all, who, being in contact with the divine Love,
   are not saved by it.

   The last limitation is necessary, for of the heathen it can not be said
   that they are hardened. Only they can be hardened who live under the
   Covenant of Grace. It is true that the heathen develop a reprobate
   mind. Their heart is darkened. Walking in their own ways they are
   impelled irresistibly, for the process of sin can not be stopped; but
   this is not the proper conception of the hardening as the Scripture
   presents it.

   Heathen nations and individuals may come in direct contact with the
   Lord and His Anointed, as Pharaoh and Sihon through their relations
   with Israel; and as the Turks and the peoples of India and China who
   now are in touch with Christian nations and missionaries. Of course, we
   do not mean to say that mere casual contact with a Christian nation or
   missionary makes a Mohammedan or heathen nation responsible. This is
   impossible. When in Epirus the Turks meet hordes who call themselves
   Christians, but are utterly devoid of the Spirit of Christ and in
   savagery rather surpass the bashi-bazouks, then no ray from the cross
   falls upon the crescent by this meeting. The fact that a missionary
   settles in an obscure corner of a heathen nation, opens a little
   school, and talks about the Scripture with a few individuals, in a
   manner which betrays his ignorance of human nature, does not make that
   nation responsible. They know nothing about it; it leaves the national
   life wholly untouched.

   The Christian nations, their governments, their churches, and their
   missionaries, may well ask themselves whether by such playing at
   missions they do not increase their own responsibilities rather than
   those of the heathen nations. How serious these responsibilities,
   especially regarding the heathen and Mohammedan nations! Owing to the
   divine pleasure the Christian nations possess a moral and material
   superiority. England alone is perfectly able to control China, Japan,
   the whole of India and Turkey besides. There is not the slightest
   prospect that the heathen nations will, for a long time to come, be
   able to cope successfully with the nations of Christendom. In their own
   native jungles they may be able to maintain themselves, but as soon as
   they come in the open field they are vanquished. We may harass the
   Chinese, but it never enters our minds that they will effect a landing
   upon our shores.

   Whether this will so continue is another question. As the Christian
   nations return more and more to Judaism, and thence to heathenism, it
   is very possible that they will lose also their material superiority.
   There are already signs showing that China may some time seriously vex
   the Christian nations; and in India our possession is not as
   undisturbed as once it was. The ancient moral greatness and
   world-supremacy of the heathen nations should not be forgotten; it is
   only fifteen centuries ago that that state of things was reversed. All
   the more reason why the Christian nations should consider that they owe
   their power and glory only to the name of Christ; and that they are
   responsible unto God for the performance of their duty toward these
   nations. God demands that we bring them in contact with Christ; and
   they themselves are entitled to it.

   This contact should be comprehensive. It should be noticeable in the
   European and American settlers in those countries; in the laws and
   institutions which we impose upon them; in the writings and information
   which we bring them; especially in our preaching of Christ among them.
   And comparing these moderate claims with the reported shameful manner
   in which men calling themselves Christians act in those countries,
   their immoralities, their cruelties, their grasping, their corrupting
   of the nations by, their unjust laws and iniquitous practises--e.g.,
   the opium traffic--it is obvious that, instead of our being the cause
   of the hardening of the heathen nations, our own debt and
   responsibilities, with regard to them are largely increased.

   It is true that some nations have labored among the heathen with great
   success; there are even some small heathen nations which, owing to
   their contact with excellent Christian men, governors and missionaries,
   may be said to have come into contact with Christ; and, if they did not
   receive Him, such contact must be the cause of their hardening. But
   these are exceptions, and we members of the Reformed churches can not
   boast that our share in revolutionizing the heathen world will be very
   great.

   But with these exceptions we limit the hardening to men who, living in
   Christian countries, have long been under the influence of the Gospel.
   This applies also to Israel under the Old Covenant. The Church now
   spread among the nations was hid in Israel. The hardening seldom
   occurred among the heathen, and as a rule was confined to the Jews. In
   saying that the elect have obtained it, while the rest were hardened
   (Rom. xi. 7), St. Paul evidently refers to Israel exclusively, as
   appears from the context: "Israel hath not obtained that which he
   seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it; and the rest were
   hardened." And then follows a description of this hardening, borrowed
   from Isa. xxix. 10: "The Lord hath poured out upon them a spirit of
   deep sleep; eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should
   not hear." Hence the hardening which now manifests itself as a new
   working is confined to the Christian Church. The hardening still upon
   Israel is an after-effect of the ancient judgment; it is not new. By
   their Christ-rejection before Gabbatha, on Calvary, and on Pentecost,
   they brought it upon themselves, and can not be delivered from it
   except through the gift of new grace. Hence in the discussion of
   present hardening it does not come into consideration.

   As a rule, the hardening which in our days and in our own circles
   manifests itself is confined to the Christian Church, and follows in
   the track of holy Baptism.

   And here we distinguish a personal and a collective hardening. With
   reference to the latter, a sad but well-known fact will explain our
   meaning. In many districts, here and elsewhere, the correct ideas of
   holy wedlock are falsified; not only recently, but for ages. This is
   evident from the fact that the marital relation is entered upon through
   sin before the marriage is confirmed, making it "obligatory," as it is
   said. This is a collective hardening against the divine blessing of
   holy wedlock. It is a popular sin which affects not only the
   individual, but his entire generation and whole environment. In like
   manner there is sin in every trade and business, without which it is
   said one can not be a business man. "Every man is a thief in his own
   store"; and with such-like sinful jests the matter is dismissed. Every
   new clerk is properly initiated. He that does not know the tricks is
   deemed incompetent, and the unwilling are said to spoil the game.

   In this sense there is a collective hardening in many countries and
   churches which has fallen upon the multitudes as a spirit of slumber.
   One has only to compare the churches of Scotland and of Spain to be
   convinced of the fact. The churches of both countries confess the name
   of the same Lord Jesus Christ; they read the same Gospel; partly sing
   the same psalms; there is scarcely one mystery of faith confessed in
   Scotland that is not confessed in Spain. But with all this similarity,
   what immeasurable difference! In both nations one is baptized with the
   same Baptism and nourished with the same Lord's Supper; but how vastly
   different the manifestation of the ecclesiastical life! We do not deny
   that in the churches of Scotland there maybe many a lack and defect. We
   even allow that in the Church of Spain there may be an occasional
   tender glow of love, while in the north of Great Britain we find
   something cold and chilling. But apart from this, what clear and
   positive consciousness in Scotland, and how heavy the veil which covers
   the face of Christ's Church in Spain! It is true Spain still possesses
   the confession of saving truth, but deeply buried under numberless
   human institutions. The luster of holy things divine is dim and feeble.
   We deny not the working of divine grace in the Spanish Church, and we
   gladly admit that Christ is preached even under the veil, and that His
   elect are being gathered unto eternal life. But for the rest, what
   dulness of soul, what hardening of spirit! It is evident that in that
   grandly beautiful country an evil power oppresses the spirits, against
   which they wrestle in vain,

   Altho less conspicuously and on a smaller scale, the same collective
   hardening is found everywhere. In the Scottish Highlands the Church is
   much purer than in the Lowlands. In the Lutheran Church in Norway
   spiritual life is much tenderer than in Saxony. In the Canton du Vaud
   it is much more energetic than in Berne. And in our own land, who does
   not mourn for Drente as compared to Zeeland? Who does not know that the
   rural districts of South Holland are spiritually much more susceptible
   than those of North Holland? And who can fail to notice the difference
   between sand and clay in Friesland and in Gelderland? But if we possess
   deeper insight and larger life, owing to the more favorable
   circumstances of environment and education, we should not boast
   ourselves. If we had been planted in such dry ground, we should
   probably have grown up just as thin and ill-favored.

   To measure every man's guilt with reference to this collective
   hardening is not our business, but the Lord is the judge of all the
   earth. But it is our business to oppose this hardening, wherever we
   meet it, with the leaven of the Word, and to pray without ceasing for
   deliverance from this spiritual plague. Again and again the hardening,
   which had been upon villages and cities--and whole countries, has been
   lifted by the boldness of a single preacher of righteousness. It may be
   incurable as in Sodom and Gomorrah, which were to be destroyed, while
   Nineveh could still repent. But this is exceptional. Ordinarily we see
   the most hardened nations awake from their spiritual slumber as soon as
   the preacher of repentance summons them to return to God.

   Altogether different is the personal hardening which, in greater or
   smaller measure, comes upon all who live under the influence of the
   Gospel without being quickened by it--who were baptized with water and
   not with the Holy Spirit; and of this personal hardening the apostle
   testifies: "The election hath obtained it, but the rest were hardened."
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXXVI.

  The Apostolic Love.

   "He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts."-- John xii. 40.

   It is singular that the hardening, in its most awful manifestation,
   finds its exponent not in Jeremiah, the stern preacher of repentance,
   nor in St. Paul, the logic confessor and witness of the divine
   sovereignty, but in St. John, the apostle of love. St. John knows men
   whom he designates as "children of the devil," who as such are the
   opposite of the children of God.

   Jesus had entered the holy city amid the hosannas of the enthusiastic
   multitudes. All Jerusalem apparently came out to hail Him. Even the
   resident Greeks asked for Him. It was the hour of triumph and glory.
   And yet, in the midst of this popular applause, Jesus knows that He is
   the "Man of Sorrows," and declares to His disciples that He is like the
   grain of wheat which, "except it fall into the ground and die, abideth
   alone, but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit." (John xii. 12) Then
   He cried out: "Now is My soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father,
   save Me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour.
   Father, glorify Thy name." (John xii. 27, 28) And immediately there
   came a voice from heaven, saying: "I have both glorified it and will
   glorify it again." (John xii. 28) The people that surrounded Him
   "thought that it had thundered, and others said that an angel had
   spoken to Him." (John xii. 29) It was one of the most solemn and
   impressive signs that ever have attended the preaching of the Word--an
   event like that of Carmel; a direct answer from heaven.

   Still under its impression, Jesus continues His words to the multitude,
   saying: "While ye have the light believe in the light, that ye may be
   the children of the light." (John xii. 36) And what was the answer?
   Another hosanna like that when Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead,
   and which was honestly meant by some? Indeed not. When, instead of
   promising them that He would raise up the kingdom and deliver it from
   Roman bondage, Jesus presented to them the claims of faith, then they
   resisted Him, and the evil in their eyes betrayed the opposite of peace
   in their hearts. The same Nazarene whom a moment ago they had hailed
   with the waving of palms, they now are ready to bury under showers of
   stones. Jesus, seeing this, departed and hid Himself from them. And
   thus, on that public square of Jerusalem, the multitude was left alone.
   They had rejected the King whom they should have adored. A voice had
   spoken from heaven, but they had stopped their ears.

   Deluded people! You know not whom ye have rejected, and that your
   rejection of today must lead to His crucifixion tomorrow. You rejected
   Him, and, with Him, yourselves forever. For this is what St. John, the
   witness of peace and love, under the direct inspiration of the Holy
   Spirit, writes concerning them:. "Tho He had done so many miracles
   before them, yet they believed not on Him, that the saying of Esaias
   the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed
   our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? Therefore they
   could not believe, because Esaias said again, He hath blinded their
   eyes and hardened their hearts; that they should not see with their
   eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should
   heal them." (John xii. 37-40)

   "They could not believe." No judgment could be keener, more direct,
   more fearful! Who can hear these words without an aching heart? Who
   trembles not when the holy apostle declares, that such are the
   ordinances of the Kingdom? Who does not bow the head in the presence of
   such blinding mysteries? Oh, that we might erase these words from the
   Gospel! But we may not. Tho they most painfully affect us, tho we can
   not sufficiently admonish one another never to speak of these fearful
   mysteries but with a loving and sorrowing heart, yet they may not be
   taken from the Gospel. Without them even St. John's Evangel would not
   be intact, rich, and complete. The Scripture may not be emasculated.

   It was Jesus who discovered that these wretchedly sinful men of
   Jerusalem were hardened and stiffnecked. This comes, not to men in Rome
   or Athens, but to men in the Jewish capital. It is remarkable that when
   the Greeks came to Philip naively asking for Jesus, these children of
   Abraham should be manifested as hardened in their hearts. There had
   been such men in Jericho, Bethany, and Jerusalem twenty years ago; but
   the apostle declares that this somber prophecy of the completed
   hardening was fulfilled to its fullest extent only in the men who were
   then the leaders of public opinion in Jerusalem, who were hardened by
   their contact, not with John the Baptist, but with Jesus.

   The effect of contact with Jesus is so decisive that it determines the
   whole subsequent course of a man's life and being forever. There is no
   one greater and more glorious than Jesus. Whom Jesus does not save can
   not be saved. He who sees no light in Jesus must forever wander in
   darkness. He is the touchstone. Tested by Him, the soul stands
   revealed.

   From this narrative, and from all that the Scripture reveals on this
   subject, it is therefore piteously evident that our greatest glory,
   viz., our Christian assurance and the most awful misery which the soul
   can conceive, the hardening of a human being, stand side by side,
   belong together in causal connection. Rock of offense; fall and rising
   again for many in Israel; a sign that shall be spoken against; savor of
   life, but also savor of death--we wonder how it is possible that He who
   is the Savior of the soul can also cause its deadly corruption to
   become manifest!

   And yet it is a fact; the Word of God leaves no room for doubt. And
   what is still more wonderful, this fearful operation of being a savor
   of death proceeds from Christ in one of the most glorious moments of
   His life: in the moment when He shines in all the greatness of His
   majesty. The hour had come when, like a grain of mustard-seed, He
   should fall into the ground. The Galileans saw their Lord. The Greeks
   asked after Him. The voice from heaven was still vibrating in their
   ears. With touching entreaty He called them to repentance. And it is in
   that moment that the enmity of the human heart shows Him its deadly
   hatred, and in its base resistance compels Him to hide Himself. And
   then their hardening of heart becomes manifest.

   There is no escape from this critical moment. Every man must be drawn
   to Christ. And he that has come to Him must see more and more of His
   greatness and holiness, and become more intimately acquainted with Him.
   And by this very entrance into the inner sanctuary the lost soul
   discovers its own true inwardness, and whether it will ever come to a
   rending of the veil.

   But from this we should never draw the wrong inference, that it is then
   the safest course never to bring our children to Jesus. This is not
   left to our decision. The Lord of Hosts is He who commands us: "Suffer
   the little children to come unto Me." (Mark x. 14) But what this deep
   mystery ought to teach us is, not to throw holy things to the dogs, nor
   to make an ostentatious display of divine truth. Altho we do not judge
   others, but rather let their zeal in spreading the Gospel rebuke our
   luke-warmness, yet we must remind them of the fact that they deal with
   fire. Surely no other than the sharp two-edged sword of the Spirit can
   reach the inward seat of corruption; but remember, carelessly handled,
   it may wound some vital part. And therefore; in the spirit of love, we
   must ever admonish the brethren never to preach the awful Gospel in a
   thoughtless and careless manner, but always with greatest caution and
   holy earnestness. For the work of preaching the Gospel is exceedingly
   delicate.

   As to the question, How does the hardening occur? we simply say that
   every effort to be wise above that which is written must be opposed;
   being conscious of our own limitations, we prefer to watch lest our own
   soul fall under this terrible judgment, rather than to lose ourselves
   in the vain effort to analyze what we can not conceive of but in the
   unity of the holy mystery.

   But this we may say: that in nature God offers us many illustrations of
   the fact that in its highest activity the same power can have opposite
   effects. Without rain the field parches and vegetation burns; but the
   same rain that elsewhere makes the grain to grow, in the ill-drained
   field causes the crop to decay. The same sun that warms the ground and
   matures the grain in one acre, will harden the ground and scorch the
   crop in another. The same food that nourishes and strengthens the
   healthful, burdens the weak and endangers the life of the sick.
   Knowledge is glorious, and at its fountain man loves to quench his
   thirst; but how appalling the corruption caused, either by its
   one-sided application or by an ill-proportioned estimate of its value!
   Holy and tender is the bond between husband and wife, mother and child;
   but is there any passion that has added more to the pollution and
   desecration of human life than this very desire for the married state
   and this longing to become a mother?

   The law is universal that the highest excellency, failing to accomplish
   its purpose, reverses its action and causes destruction, pollution, and
   often hopeless ruin, in much greater measure than if it were less
   excellent. And knowing this; is it strange that the same law prevails
   in the highest domain, viz., the Love of God?

   Hardening is but the effect of the divine Love turned in the opposite
   direction. It cherishes or it consumes. It draws to heaven or it
   blights in hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXXVII.

  The Sin Against the Holy Ghost.

   "The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto
   men."-- Matt. xii. 31.

   Altho the love of God, failing of its purpose, always causes hardening
   of heart, yet at times it has a still more terrible effect, for it may
   lead to the sin against the Holy Ghost.

   The results of this sin are especially crushing and terrible. Christ's
   words concerning it are startling and penetrating, casting the guilty
   soul into everlasting despair:

   "He that is not with Me is against Me; and he that gathereth not with
   Me scattereth abroad. Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and
   blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the
   Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a
   word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever
   speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither
   in this world, neither in the world to come" (Matt. xii. 30-32).

   St. Mark puts it still more harshly: "Verily I say unto you, All sins
   shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith
   soever they shall blaspheme. But he that shall blaspheme against the
   Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"
   (Mark iii. 28, 29, R. V.).

   St. John writes concerning it: "If any man see his brother sin a sin
   which is not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life for
   him that sins not unto death. There is a sin unto death; I do not say
   that he shall pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a
   sin not unto death. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not;
   but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one
   toucheth him not" (1 John v. 16-18).

   And St. Paul writes: "For it is impossible for those who were once
   enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made
   partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good Word of God, and
   the powers of the age to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them
   again unto repentance; seeing they crucify unto themselves the Son of
   God afresh, and put Him to an open shame. For the earth which drinketh
   in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for
   them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God; but that which
   beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose
   end is to, be burned" (Heb. vi. 4-8). Such cutting words would perplex
   the soul, if he had not added: "But, beloved, we are persuaded better
   things of you, and things that accompany salvation, tho we thus speak.
   For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which
   ye have showed toward His name" (vs. 9, 10).

   They are words of comfort, which, however, do not detract from the dead
   earnestness with which he speaks in the tenth chapter: "For if we sin
   wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
   remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for
   of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
   He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three
   witnesses. Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
   thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
   counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an
   unclean thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? For we
   know Him that saith, Vengeance belongeth unto Me, I will recompense;
   saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people. It is a
   fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Heb. x.
   26-31).

   Much more might be added. It is written of Esau that he could find no
   place of repentance. St. Peter and St. Jude, full of indignation, write
   of persons who "have gone the way of Cain," who "ran greedily after the
   error of Balaam," and who "perished in the gainsaying of Korach." But
   these words have no direct reference to the sin against the Holy
   Spirit. Enough has been said to convince our readers that we treat this
   fearful sin, not upon our own authority, but upon the authority of the
   Holy Spirit.

   We open the discussion by emphasizing that no child of God could or
   ever can commit this sin. It is necessary to say this to prevent many
   souls from being troubled. There is such unutterable distress in these
   words of Jesus: "All manner of sin shall be forgiven unto men, but the
   blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven; neither in the
   present world, neither in the world to come." (Matt. xii. 31-32) For
   that sin there is no intercession either in heaven or on earth. Such
   prayer is even denounced and forbidden as unholy. Indeed, we realize
   how afflicted souls, tossed with tempest and not comforted, especially
   when suffering from a weak brain and unsound nerves, can become so
   morbid as to ask: Have I committed that sin? And if so, what is the use
   of prayers and tears? For then I am lost, hopelessly and forever.

   And such cruel spiritual distress may not be allowed. It is the result
   of a defective religious training, and, still more, of the preaching
   which, culpably ignorant of the deep ways of the soul, prates about
   many things, but scarcely ever treats the solemn things that pertain to
   eternity. It must be reiterated to these afflicted souls referred to,
   clearly and distinctly, that no child of God ever can commit this sin.
   It does not belong to the broken and contrite heart, but cankers only
   in the proud spirit that opposes the Lord and His holy ordinances.

   It is true the apostle declares that the men guilty of this sin "were
   once enlightened," and "have tasted of the heavenly gift," and "were
   made partakers of the Holy Ghost," and " have tasted the good Word of
   God and the powers of the age to come"; but they are never said to have
   had a broken and a contrite heart. On the contrary, they mind high
   things; they rely upon their exalted experiences; boast of a certain
   partiality which the Lord has lately shown them; but give no evidence
   that they ever smote the breast, or fell down as dead before the divine
   Majesty, or ever found it a consuming fire.

   It is a singular fact that the very persons who make us think of the
   word of Scripture, "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
   fall," are never afraid of eternal perdition; while those who are in
   not the least likely to sin against the Holy Ghost are frequently in
   fear and trembling lest they fall into it. Physicians of insane asylums
   are familiar with the facts.

   And there is but one remedy for these afflicted souls, viz., to feed
   them with Scripture before they are afflicted. Of course, he that
   broods and mutters about his sin outside of the Word can not escape
   being haunted by the Cain-thought of a sin too great to be forgiven,
   and in the end the loss of his mind. But he who lives near the Word is
   safe and can not be so afflicted.

   The Scripture gives a clear and transparent exposition of the sin
   against the Holy Spirit. The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem
   were seeing glorious things and were hearing heavenly words, for Jesus
   was standing in their midst. And while with eye and ear they were
   tasting of these heavenly gifts, they dared say: "He hath Beelzebub,
   the prince of the devils." (Mark iii. 22) And to this blasphemous
   statement Jesus answered immediately that these persons had committed
   the sin against the Holy Ghost, "because they said He had an unclean
   spirit." (Mark iii. 30) Wherefore, among well-disposed persons, there
   can be no difference of opinion in this matter. The sin against the
   Holy Spirit can be committed only by persons who, beholding the beauty
   and majesty of the Lord, turn the light into darkness and deem the
   highest glory of the Son of God's love to belong to Satan and his
   demons. And, since the afflicted souls already referred to are
   conscious of their inability to grasp holy things, and are acquainted
   with the sinful suggestions of their own heart, yet, despite these
   suggestions, earnestly desire to be persuaded of their Savior's love,
   therefore it is impossible that they can ever become the guilty victims
   of despair.

   It may not be denied, however, that in the hearts of the saints awful
   thoughts sometimes arise against the Holy One. The pool of iniquity
   underneath our hearts, with its poisonous gases, continues until death.
   While we are engaged in the reading of the Word, in prayer, or in holy
   meditation, suggestions sometimes flash through the mind which startle
   us as the poisoned sting of a wasp, which we would like to tear from
   head and heart, from which we shrink with the cry as tho struck by
   lightning: O God, deliver me! But these suggestions have nothing to do
   with the sin against the Holy Spirit; for we do not identify ourselves
   with them, do not cherish them, but cast them aside as we would an
   adder. They come through us, but are not of us. Or, rather, they spring
   from our sinful nature, but are unwedded to our will--in fact,
   repugnant to our will.

   We should take heed, therefore, lest, by departing from the Scripture,
   we estrange our souls from the love of God. This would please Satan
   only too well. He loves to use that sin against the Holy Spirit to vex
   weak souls, and their anguish delights his heart. Therefore they must
   not be allowed to brood upon this fearful word of Scripture. It is true
   the Gospel is terribly in earnest, but at the same time it is the
   Gospel of all consolation, and no man may ever rob it of that
   character.

   In close adherence to the Word, we add that ordinary wanderers from God
   do not commit the sin against the Holy Spirit; for they have seen
   naught of the powers and glories of the age to come (Heb. vi.). To
   commit this sin two things are required, which absolutely belong
   together:

   First, close contact with the glory which is manifest in Christ or in
   His people.

   Second, not mere contempt of that glory, but the declaration that the
   Spirit which manifests itself in that glory, which is the Holy Spirit,
   is a manifestation of Satan.

   One may sin against the Son and not be lost forever. There is hope of
   pardon in the day of judgment for the men who crucified Him. But he who
   desecrates, despises, and slanders the Spirit, who speaks in Christ, in
   His Word, and in His work, as tho He were the spirit of Satan, is lost
   in eternal darkness. This is a wilful sin, intentionally malicious. It
   betrays systematic opposition to God. That sinner can not be saved, for
   he has done despite unto the Spirit of all grace. He has lost the last
   remnant in the sinner, the taste for grace, and, with it the
   possibility of receiving grace.

   Hence this word of Jesus is divinely intended to put souls on their
   guard; the souls of the saints, lest they treat the Word of God coldly,
   carelessly, indifferently; the souls of false shepherds and deceivers
   of the people who, ministering in the holy mysteries of the cross,
   contemptuously speak of the "blood theology"--blaspheming the supremest
   manifestation of divine love as an unrighteous abomination; the souls
   of all who have forsaken the way; who once knew the truth and now
   reject it, and who in their self-concept decry their still believing
   brethren as ignorant fanatics. Their judgment shall be heavy indeed.
   Nineveh did not resist the prophet, and was exalted above Capernaum and
   Bethsaida!

   From this, Christian love deduces a twofold exhortation:

   First, to professed believers, by ignorance and presumption not to
   tempt others to fall into this sin.

   Second, to erring brethren, not to say that skepticism is the way
   leading to the truth. For this very skepticism is the fatal gate by
   which the sinner enters upon the awful sin against the Holy Spirit.

  Christ or Satan.

   "But the greatest of these is Love." --1 Cor. xiii. 13.

   However fearful the Scripture's revelation of the hardening of heart,
   yet it is the only price at which the Almighty offers man the blessed
   promise of Love's infinite wealth.

   Light without shadow is inconceivable; and the purer and the more
   brilliant the light, the darker and the more distinctly delineated the
   shadows must be. In like manner, faith is inconceivable without the
   opposite of doubt; hope without the distressful tension of despair; the
   highest enjoyment of love without the keenest incision of hatred. If
   this is so among men, how much more strongly must it appear when God
   sheds abroad His love by the Holy Spirit?

   Even among men love always loses in depth what it gains in breadth.
   Hence there are multitudes of men of whom all speak well and no one
   speaks ill; who, tho not pursued by hatred, are neither loved with
   passionate love. And there are men whom no one can treat with
   indifference; who inspire some with ardent love and others with violent
   hatred. How devoted the love of Timothy and Philemon for St. Paul, and
   with what hatred did the Jewish teachers persecute him! How
   affectionate the attachment of the circle of German Reformers for
   Martin Luther, and how bitter the violence of the Romish hierarchy
   against him! How deep and tender the love of our Christian people for
   Groen van Prinsteren, the noble champion of our Christian interests,
   and how fierce the hatred and bitterness wherewith the men of
   neutrality have pursued him all the days of his life! The court circles
   of St. Petersburg almost worship the Russian Czar, while every nihilist
   abhors him as an incarnate devil.

   And this is true in every country and every age. As soon as love has
   taken root in the soil of principles, it separates the best friends and
   finds its opposite pole in the most fearful hatred. Love which is
   inspired only by amiable traits, which has no other ground than mutual
   good will, which is the daughter of a compliant disposition, which is
   supported by mutual service, burning of incense or self-interest, never
   arouses such hatred. But as soon as love adopts a nobler and holier
   character; when it loves the friend not for his appearance,
   disposition, winning ways, and pleasing forms, but in spite of his
   unyielding nature, stern claims, and disagreeable traits, simply
   because he is the bearer of a conviction, the interpreter of a
   principle, the mighty pleader of an ideal, then hatred can not tarry a
   year, but follows love in its wake, and rages as bitterly and violently
   as love's attachment is tender and animating.

   This was never more obvious than in the Person of Christ. His
   contemporaries are entitled to fair treatment. With the exception of
   those to whom it had been specially revealed, not one saw in the Rabbi
   of Nazareth the Son of God, the Hope of the Fathers, and the Promised
   Messiah. The great mass of the people hailed Him merely as the Hero of
   His conviction, the Preacher of Righteousness, One who was filled with
   zeal for high and holy principles.

   And what does the history of His life reveal? That at the first
   meeting, enchanted by His holy eye, touched by His eloquent word,
   overcome by His word of love, men offer Him homage and join the
   hosannas of the multitudes. But also that this superficial acquaintance
   is soon followed by a change of inclination and disposition, in some
   developing into positive faith and entire surrender to His Person, and
   in others into hatred which becomes more violent day by day.

   Jesus troubled no one. No bitter word ever escaped His lips. There were
   thousands whom He blessed and not one whom He harmed. Even the little
   children He drew to Himself and kissed their smiling lips. And yet,
   already at His first appearance in Nazareth, evil passions begin to
   rage against Him. What the wrong was that He had done no one could
   tell; but they could not bear Him; He annoyed them; He was to them an
   eyesore; He must go. So long as He remains in the land of the living,
   there can be no rest in Palestine, so they thought.

   This accounts for the frequent efforts of the mob to stone and kill
   Him; for the foul epithets they applied to Him, saying "that He was
   beside Himself," "that He had a devil and was mad," "that He stirred up
   the people," that He was a "glutton" and "wine-bibber." And when all
   this was of no avail, and Jesus continued to inspire the few with still
   greater love, and the number of the Johns and Marys increased, then
   they judged that severer measures should be taken; then the hatred
   became persecution; then the honest women of Jerusalem cried, "His
   blood be upon us and upon our children" (Matt. xxvii. 25); and,
   thirsting after His blood, the mob cried, "Crucify Him!" and the
   tempest of unholy passion abated not until they saw Him dying upon the
   cross. Hence by the cross stood John and Mary, whose love for Jesus was
   never surpassed, side by side with the leaders of Jerusalem, who dare
   mock and defy Him even in His dying moments, while they almost
   suffocate with their own rage.

   If Jesus had not come and openly testified of the Father, Jerusalem's
   grave gentlemen would never have been guilty of such base and
   dishonorable passions. In fact, His public appearance in Jerusalem and
   in Judea was the spark which ignited these passions. Without Him the
   rabbis would never have committed such heinous sin; if Jesus had not
   come from heaven, the earth would never have looked upon a hatred so
   base, bitter, and violent.

   Why, then, did He not rather stay away? Why did He come on the earth?
   For He knew what hatred His coming would arouse. He knew that
   -indirectly- He would cause Iscariot to become a Judas, a child of the
   devil. He knew that He would become a fall and a rising again of many;
   a stone of stumbling; a sign that should be spoken against. He knew
   that by contact with Him thousands would become transgressors, and some
   even would commit the sin against the Holy Ghost. He knew all this, for
   He suffered all by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
   And yet He came. He spoke. He executed His awful task upon the earth,
   to be a Savior to thousands of souls, but also a rock of offense to
   thousands of others.

   And why was He not prevented from coming, that all this terrible evil
   might be avoided? For the sake of Love, O children of the Kingdom!

   For Love is greatest; Love is the highest right; and Love, full, rich,
   and divine, could not be shed abroad in the hearts of men but at this
   price. Love less great would have stirred up hatred less violent. If
   this Love had not come at all, hatred would have been wholly quenched.
   This Love alone aroused that hatred. Inflamed by the perfection of this
   Love, it broke forth into such demoniac maliciousness. No sooner does
   Love show its shining countenance than hatred belches forth its lurid
   flames. Without this fearful outbreak of unholiness, holiness can not
   exist in this sinful world.

   This brings us back to the Holy Spirit. The character and power of any
   form of love are determined by the holy or unholy nature of the spirit
   which dwells in it. Of course, earthly love can not realize its highest
   power unless the Holy Spirit dwell in it and kindle its holy spark in
   the human heart. And since He animates all created life, He animates
   also the life of love; and then it begins to live, receives a soul, is
   truly animated, and the promise of the Father is fulfilled in the
   Church and in our hearts, and love is shed abroad by the Holy Ghost.

   So the full and penetrating operation of love came only on Pentecost.
   Then the walls that separated Israel were broken down, and the river of
   its life disclosed its bed broad and deep for every people and nation.
   There were tongues as of fire, and there was a speaking with the
   tongues of all nations. They had all things in common. They were
   embraced in the union of one purpose. The melody of the psalm of praise
   pervaded every circle which called upon the name of the Lord.

   But, alas! with the light of love came also the fearful shadow of
   hatred, which works obstinacy, ends in hardening, and adds unto itself
   the death by the sin against the Holy Ghost.

   And this is a fearful thing. Yet if you could prevail upon the Father
   of Lights to quench the pure light of love, would you say: "Lord,
   quench it"? Would you dare pray that the shedding abroad of that love
   should cease from the earth?

   And thus, amid the differences, wranglings, and discords, amid the
   tumult of hatred and the din of profanity and blasphemy, the work of
   redemption goes on, and the operation of the Holy Spirit continues to
   fulfil the counsel of God. Thus the King reigns royally; souls are
   converted; the rebellious are comforted; acts of self-denial and noble
   consecration are multiplied; pity shines and mercy scintillates; and,
   hid from the eyes of men, perfect love cherishes the soul that was
   chilled by its own guilt, and imparts to the earth something of the
   sweetness and blessedness of its owm holy being.

   And all this will continue until the Church militant has finished its
   last fight. Then shall the end come, the token of the Son of Man shall
   be seen in the clouds, and then only the consummation of glory shall
   appear, wherein every work of the profane spirit shall be destroyed and
   the work of the Holy Spirit shall be completed--completed in the
   manifestation of glory, in the wiping away of many tears, in the
   removing of every hindrance, in the beholding of what eyes have never
   seen and the hearing of what ears have never heard, in the ecstasy of
   what never has entered the human heart; but, more than all this, in the
   perfect revelation of love in its holiest and purest manifestation, in
   the undisturbed communion with the Lord our God.

PRAYER.
     __________________________________________________________________

  XXXIX.

  The Essence of Prayer.

   "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
   watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
   saints."--Ephes. vi. 18.

   In the last place we consider the work of the Holy Spirit in prayer.

   It appears from Scripture, more than has been emphasized, that in the
   holy act of prayer there is a manifestation of the Holy Spirit working
   both in us and with us. And yet this appears clearly from the apostolic
   word: "Likewise the Spirit helpeth also our infirmities: for we know
   not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered. And He
   that knoweth the heart, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because
   He maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God"
   (Rom. viii. 26, 27). Christ expresses this with equal clearness when He
   teaches the woman of Samaria that "God is a Spirit, and the true
   worshipers worship the Father in spirit and in truth" (John iv. 24);
   for, so He adds, "the Father seeketh such to worship Him." In almost
   similar sense St. Paul writes to the Ephesians: "Praying always with
   all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
   all perseverance and supplication for all saints." (Ephes. vi. 18)

   They already possessed the ancient promise to Zacharias: "And I will
   pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
   the Spirit of grace and of supplication" (Zach. xii. 10). And this
   promise was fulfilled when the apostle could testify concerning Christ:
   "For through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father"
   (Ephes. ii. 18). In the "Abba, Father" of our prayers the Holy Spirit
   beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God (Rom.
   viii. 15). And in her longing for the coming of the Bridegroom, not
   only the Bride, but the Spirit and the Bride pray: "Come, Lord Jesus,
   come quickly." Upon closer examination, it appears that prayer can not
   be separated from the spiritual rule that we must pray: "Not as tho we
   had received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit of God, that we
   might know the things that are freely given us of God"; a prayer which
   we then offer, "Not with the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but
   which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with
   spiritual" (1 Cor. ii. 12, 13).

   Hence there can be no doubt that even in our prayers we must
   acknowledge and honor a work of the Holy Spirit; and the special
   treatment of this tender subject may bear fruit in the exercise of our
   own prayers. We do not propose, however, to treat here the entire
   subject of prayer, which belongs to the explanation of the Heidelberg
   Catechism on this point; but we wish simply to emphasize the
   significance of the Holy Spirit's work for the prayers of the saint.

   In the first place, we must discover the silver thread that, in the
   nature of the case, connects the essence of our prayer with the work of
   the Holy Spirit.

   For all prayer is not equal. There is a great difference between the
   high-priestly prayer of the Lord Jesus and the prayer of the Holy
   Spirit with groans that can not be uttered. The supplications of the
   saints on earth differ from those of the saints in heaven, those who
   rejoice before the throne and those who cry from under the altar. Even
   the prayers of the saints of earth are not the same in the various
   spiritual conditions from which they pray. There are prayers of the
   Bride, that is, from all the saints on earth as a whole; and prayers of
   the local assemblies of believers, supplications from the circles of
   brethren when two or three are gathered in the name of Jesus; and
   supplications of individual believers poured out in the solitude of the
   closet. And distinguished in the root from these prayers of the saints
   are the prayers of the still unconverted, whether regenerate or not,
   who cry unto God whom they do not know and whom they oppose.

   The question is whether the Holy Spirit is active, either in one or in
   all these prayers. Does He affect our prayers only when, in the rare
   moments of exalted spiritual life, we have intimate communion with God?
   Or does He affect only the prayers of the saint, excluding those of the
   unconverted? Or does He affect all prayer and supplication, whether
   from saint or sinner?

   Before we answer this question, it is necessary accurately to define
   prayer. For prayer may be taken in a limited sense, as a religious act
   requesting something of God, in which case it is merely the expression
   of a desire springing from a conscious want, void, or need which we ask
   God to supply; an application to the divine power and providence, in
   poverty to be enriched, in danger to be protected, in temptation to be
   kept standing. Or it may be taken in a wider sense and include
   thanksgiving. In the Reformed Church the Service of Prayer always
   includes the Service of Thanksgiving. In this sense the Heidelberg
   Catechism treats it, calling prayer the chief part of thankfulness (q.
   116). In fact, we can scarcely conceive of prayer, in the higher sense,
   ascending to the Throne of Grace without thanksgiving.

   Moreover, prayer also includes praise and every outpouring of the soul.
   Prayer without praise and thanksgiving is no prayer. In the
   supplication of saints, prayer and adoration go together. Oppressed
   with the multitude of thoughts, the soul may have no definite
   supplication, or thanksgiving, or hymn of praise, yet frequently feels
   constrained to pour out those thoughts before the Lord. When, in Psalm
   xc., Moses pours out his prayer, there is: (1) a supplication, "Lord
   how long! and let it repent Thee concerning Thy servants"; (2)
   thanksgiving, "Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all
   generations"; (3) praise, "Before the mountains were brought forth, or
   ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting
   to everlasting Thou art God." And besides these there is (4) an
   outpouring of the thoughts that fill his soul, "We are consumed by
   Thine anger, and by Thy wrath are we troubled"; and stronger still,
   "The days of our years are threescore years and ten, and, if by reason
   of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and
   sorrow, for it is soon cut off and we fly away."

   And so we find in the high-priestly prayer of Christ (John xvii): (1) a
   supplication, "And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self,
   with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was"; or, "Holy
   Father, keep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me, that
   they may be one as We are"; (2) thanksgiving, "Thou hast given Me power
   over all flesh, that I should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast
   given Me"; (3) praise, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known
   Thee, but I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent
   Me"; (4) and besides these a manifold outpouring of the soul, which is
   neither prayer, praise, nor thanksgiving, "All Mine are Thine, and
   Thine are Mine"; "I have glorified Thee on the earth; I have finished
   the work which Thou gavest Me to do"; "For their sakes I sanctify
   Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."

   We did not assign a special place to the confession of guilt and sin,
   because this is included in supplication, to which it leads and of
   which it is the moving cause; while the confession of the soul's lost
   condition and natural liability to condemnation necessarily must lead
   to the pouring out of the soul.

   Therefore, speaking comprehensively, we understand by prayer: every
   religious act by which we take upon ourselves directly to speak to the
   Eternal Being.

   The only difficulty is in the Hymn of Praise. For it can not be denied
   that in a number of psalms there is a direct speaking to God in hymns
   of praise; and thus the distinction between the Prayer and the Hymn of
   Praise might be lost sight of.

   There are four steps in the Hymn of Praise: it may be a singing of the
   praise of God before one's own soul; or before the ear of the brethren;
   or before the world and the demons; or lastly, before the Lord God
   Himself.

   When the flame of holy joy burns freely in the heart of the saint,
   altho he be alone or in chains in the dungeon, he feels constrained,
   for his own satisfaction as it were, with a loud voice to sing a psalm
   to the praise of God. Thus it was that David sang: "I love the Lord
   because He hath heard my voice and my supplication." Different is the
   Hymn of Praise when, with and for the brethren, the saint sings in
   their company; for then they sing, "Blessed is the people that know the
   joyful sound; they, shall walk in the light of Thy countenance"; or
   directly addressing the people of God: "O ye seed of Abraham, His
   servant, ye children of Jacob His chosen, He is the Lord our God, His
   judgments are in all the earth." And another is the Hymn of Triumph,
   which the Church sings as it were before the world and the demons; then
   the saints sing: "Thou art the glory of our strength; and in Thy favor
   our horn shall be exalted; for the Lord is our defense; the Holy One of
   Israel is our King."

   But the Hymn of Praise rises highest when it addresses the Eternal One
   directly; when the saint thinks not of himself, nor of his brethren,
   nor of the demons, but of the Lord God alone. This is praise in its
   most solemn aspect. In the singing of the opening sentences of Psalm
   li. or Psalm cxxx. the difference is immediately felt:


   "After Thy loving-kindness, Lord, have mercy upon me,

   For Thy compassion great blot out all my iniquity";

   or:


   "Lord, from the depths to Thee I cried,

   My voice, Lord, do Thou hear;

   Unto my supplication's voice

   Give an attentive ear."

   Then praying and singing are actually become one. In order to pray
   aloud, the Church must sing, altho more for the sake of the
   supplication than of the singing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Prayer and the Consciousness.

   "Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou
   shalt glorify Me."--Psalm 1. 15.

   The form of prayer does not affect its character. It may be a mere
   groaning in thought, or a sigh in which the oppressed soul finds
   relief; it may consist of a single cry, a flow of words, or an
   elaborate invocation of the Eternal. It may even turn into speaking or
   singing. But so long as the soul, in the consciousness that God lives
   and hears its cry, addresses itself directly to Him as tho it stood in
   His immediate presence, the character of prayer remains intact.
   However, discrimination between these various forms of prayer is
   necessary in order to discover, in the root of prayer itself, the work
   of the Holy Spirit.

   The suppliant is you; your ego; neither your body nor your soul, but
   your person. It is true, both body and soul are engaged in prayer, but
   yet in such a way that your person, your ego, your self, pours out the
   soul; in the soul becomes conscious of your prayer, and through the
   body gives it utterance.

   This will become clear when we consider the part which the body takes
   in prayer; for no one will deny that the body has something to do with
   prayer. Mutual prayer is simply impossible without the aid of the body,
   for that requires a voice to utter prayer in one, and hearing ears in
   the others. Moreover, prayer without words rarely satisfies the soul.
   Mere mental prayer is necessarily imperfect; earnest, fervent prayer
   constrains us to express it in words. There maybe a depth of prayer
   that can not be expressed, but then we are conscious of the lack; and
   the fact that the Holy Spirit prays for us with groans that can not be
   uttered is to us source of very great comfort.

   When the soul is perfectly composed, mere mental meditation may be very
   sweet and blessed; but no sooner do the waters of the soul heave with
   broader swell than we feel irresistibly constrained to utter prayer in
   words; and altho in the solitude of the closet yet the silent prayer
   becomes an audible and sometimes a loud invocation of the mercies of
   our God. Even Christ in Gethsemane prayed, not in silent meditation nor
   in unuttered groans, but with strong words which still seem to sound in
   our ears.

   And not only in this, but in other ways, the body largely affects our
   prayer.

   There is, in the first place, a natural desire to make the whole body
   partake of it. For this reason we kneel when we humble ourselves before
   the majesty of God. We close the eyes not to be distracted by the
   world. We lift up the hands as invoking His grace. The agonized
   wrestler in prayer prostrates himself on the ground. We uncover the
   head in token of reverence. In the assembly of the saints the men stand
   on their feet, as they would if the King of Glory should come in.

   In the second place, the effect of the body upon prayer is evident from
   the influence which bodily conditions frequently exert upon it.
   Depressing headache, muscular or nervous pains, congestive disorders
   causing undue excitement, often prevent not the sigh, but the full
   outpouring of: prayer. Every one knows what effect drowsiness has upon
   the exercise of warm and earnest prayer. While, on the other hand, a
   vigorous constitution, clear head, and tranquil mind are peculiarly
   conducive to prayer. For this reason the Scripture and the example of
   the fathers speak of fasting as means to assist the saints in this
   exercise.

   Lastly, bodily distress prior to distress of the soul has often opened
   mute lips in prayer before God. Families that were strangers to prayer
   have learned to pray in times of serious illness. In threatening
   dangers of fire or water, lips that were used to cursing have
   frequently cried aloud in supplication. Compelled by war, famine, and
   pestilence, godless cities have frequently appointed days of prayer
   with the same zeal wherewith formerly they appointed days of rejoicing.

   Hence the significance of the body in this respect is very great - in
   fact, so great that when abnormal conditions cause the bond between
   body and soul to become inactive, prayer ceases at the same time.
   However, mere bodily exercise is not prayer, but lip-service. Mere
   imitation of the form, mere sounds of prayer tolling from the lips,
   mere words addressed to the Eternal One without conscious purpose in
   the soul, are the form of prayer, but not the power thereof.

   And this is not all. To trace the work of the Holy Spirit in prayer we
   must enter more deeply into this matter. According to the ordinary
   representation, which is partly correct, prayer is impossible without
   an act of the memory, by which we recall our sins and the mercies of
   God; without an act of the mind, choosing the words to express our
   adoration of the divine virtues; without an act of the consciousness,
   to represent our needs in prayer; without an act of love, enabling us
   to enter into the needs of our country, church, and place of
   habitation, of our relatives, children, and friends; and lastly,
   without meditating upon the fundamentals of prayer, recalling the
   promises of God, the experiences of the fathers, and the conditions of
   the Kingdom.

   All these are activities of the brain, which is the seat of the
   thinking mind; as soon as this is disturbed by abnormal conditions, the
   consciousness is obscured and the thinking ceases or becomes confused.
   Without the brain, therefore, there can be no thinking; without
   thinking there can be no thoughts; without thoughts there can be no
   accumulation of thoughts in the memory; and without meditation, which
   is the result of the former two, there can be no prayer in the proper
   sense of the word. From which it is evident that prayer depends upon
   the exercise of bodily functions much more largely than is generally
   supposed.

   And yet, let us be on our guard not to push this too far; and imagine
   that the root of prayer is in the brain, i.e., in a member of the body;
   for it is not. Our own experience in prayer teaches us, agreeably to
   the Scripture, that it is in the heart. As from the heart are the
   issues of life, so are also the issues of prayer. Unless the heart
   compels us to pray, all our cries are in vain. Men with magnificent
   brains but cold hearts have never been men of prayer; and, on the
   contrary, among the men of poor mental development, but with large,
   warm hearts, are found a number of souls mighty in prayer.

   And even this is not all; for the heart itself is a bodily organ. In
   proportion as the blood circulates through the heart with strong or
   feeble pulsation, in that proportion is the soul's vital expression
   strong and overwhelming, or weak and weary; and, dependent upon this,
   prayer is warm and animated, or cold and formal. When the heart is weak
   and suffering, the life of prayer generally loses something of its
   freshness and power.

   We are men, and not spirits; and, unlike angels, we can not exist
   without the body. God created us body and soul. The former belongs to
   our being essentially and forever. Hence an utterance of our life like
   prayer must necessarily be dependent upon soul and body, and that in
   much stronger sense than we usually suppose.

   However, the fact must be emphasized that prayer's dependence upon the
   body is not absolute. Otherwise there could be no prayer among the
   angels, nor in the Holy Spirit. Our prayer depends upon the
   consciousness; when that is lost, prayer ceases. And, since we are men,
   consisting of body and soul, the human consciousness is, in the
   ordinary sense, related also to the body. But that this dependence is
   not absolute is evident from the fact that the Eternal Being, whose
   divine consciousness is but dimly reflected in that of man, has no
   body. "God is Spirit." And the same is true of the world of spirits,
   who, altho incorporeal, yet possess a consciousness; and of the three
   Persons of the Trinity, especially of the Holy Spirit.

   Hence the question arises whether man separated by death from the body
   loses consciousness. To this we reply in the affirmative. Our human
   consciousness, as we possess it in our present earthly existence, is
   lost in death, to be restored to us in the resurrection, in a form
   stronger, purer, and holier. St. Paul says: "We,"--that is, our human
   consciousness,--" now know in part, but then we," --the same human
   consciousness,-- "shall know face to face, even as we are known."

   But from this it does not follow that in the intermediate state the
   soul must be denied all self-consciousness. The Scripture teaches the
   very contrary. Of course, for this knowledge we depend upon the
   Scripture alone. The dead can not tell us anything of their state after
   death. No one but God, who ordained the conditions of life in the
   intermediate state, can reveal to us what those conditions are. And He
   has revealed to us that immediately after death the redeemed are with
   Jesus. St. Paul says: "I have a desire to depart and to be with
   Christ." And, since a friend's presence does not afford us pleasure
   except we are conscious of it, it follows that the souls of the saints,
   in the intermediate state, must possess some sort of consciousness
   different from that which we now possess, but sufficient to realize and
   enjoy the presence of Christ. For which reasons the fathers rejected
   every representation of death as a sleep; as tho our persons from the
   moment of death to that of the resurrection should sleep in perfect
   forgetfulness of the glorious things of God; altho they denied not the
   intermediate state in which the soul is separated from the body.

   Wherefore it seems possible for the soul to be conscious in a higher
   sense, without the aid of the body, independently of the heart and the
   brains--a consciousness which enables us to realize the glorious things
   of God and the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   How this higher consciousness operates is a deep mystery; nor is the
   nature of its operation revealed. And since we can have no other
   representations than those formed by means of the brain, it is
   impossible for us to have the slightest idea of this higher
   consciousness. Its existence is revealed, but no more.

   The following may be considered as settled, and this is the principal
   thing in our present inquiry: In that temporary consciousness in which
   we will work in the intermediate state, the same person will become
   self-conscious who now is conscious by means of heart and brain. Even
   after death it shall be our own person that shall be bearer of that
   consciousness, and by it I shall be conscious of myself. It can not be
   otherwise; or else consciousness after death is impossible, for the
   simple reason that consciousness alone can not exist without a person.
   And another person it can not be. Hence my own person shall be bearer
   of that consciousness; and thus shall I be enabled to enjoy the
   presence of Jesus.

   From this we draw the following important conclusion: that so far as
   the form of the ordinary consciousness is concerned, it is dependent
   upon the body; while essentially it is not so dependent. Essentially it
   continues to exist, even when sleep obscures the thought, or insanity
   estranges me from myself, or a swoon makes me lose consciousness;
   essentially it continues to exist even when death temporarily separates
   me from the body. From which it follows that the root and seat of the
   consciousness must be looked for in the soul, and that heart and brain
   are but the vehicles, conductors, which our person uses to manifest
   that consciousness in ideas and representations.

   And since prayer is a speaking to the Eternal, i.e., a conscious
   standing before Him, it follows that the root of prayer has its seat in
   our person and in our spiritual being; and, altho bound also to the
   body, so far as the germ is concerned rests in our personal ego, in so
   far as the ego, conscious of the existence of the divine Persons and of
   the bond that unites it to them, allows that bond to operate.

   And thus we come to this final conclusion: that the possibility of
   prayer finds its deepest ground in the fact of our being created after
   the image of God. Not only is our self-consciousness a result of that
   fact, for God is eternally self-conscious, but from it also springs
   that other mighty fact that I, as a man, can be conscious of the
   existence of the Eternal, and of the intimate bond which unites me to
   Him. The consciousness of this bond and relation manifests itself in
   prayer as soon as we address ourselves to God. Hence the work of the
   Holy Spirit in prayer must be looked for in His work of the creation of
   man. And since, in our former study on this point, we discovered that
   it is God the Holy Spirit who in man's creation caused this
   consciousness to awake, carrying into it and maintaining by it the
   consciousness of the existence of God and of the bond which unites man
   to Him, it is evident that prayer, as a phenomenon in man's spiritual
   life, finds its basis directly in the work of the Holy Spirit in man's
   creation.

  XLI.

  Prayer in the Unconverted.

   "When Thou saidst, Seek ye My face, my heart said unto Thee, Thy face,
   Lord, will I seek." --Psalm xxvii. 8.

   The faculty of prayer is not an acquisition of later years, but is
   created in us, inherent in the root of our being, inseparable from our
   nature.

   And yet consistent with this fact is the fact that the great majority
   of men do not pray. It is possible to possess a faculty dormant in us
   for a whole lifetime. The Malay possesses the faculty for studying
   modern languages as well as we, but he never uses it. In sleep we
   retain our faculties of seeing and hearing, but then they are inactive.
   Altho possessed of great power, the big fellow did not lift a finger
   against the little scamp who tormented him. Hence a faculty may remain
   in us wholly undeveloped and dormant for a lifetime, or partly
   developed but suppressed. And the same is true of the faculty of
   prayer. Among the fourteen hundred millions of the earth's population,
   there are scarcely two hundred million who do not appear to be
   acquainted with prayer, altho their form of prayer is very defective.
   Of the non-praying masses, who almost exclusively occupy Europe, one
   half remember the time when, in some way or other, they used to pray.
   Many of those who have lost even that, still breathe an occasional
   prayer. And the number of them who wish that they could pray is very
   large; and among the non-praying people they represent undoubtedly the
   noblest.

   Hence we maintain our starting-point, that we owe the faculty of prayer
   to our creation. God created man as a being disposed to prayer. If this
   were not so, the faculty of prayer could not be among his endowments.
   We are created for prayer, otherwise we could never have tasted of its
   sweetness.

   To the question, Why in our creation is this a peculiar work of the
   Holy Spirit? we answer: Prayer is the drawing and pressing of the
   impressed image toward its Original, which is the Triune God. To be the
   bearers of that impressed image is the marvelous honor bestowed upon
   men. Altho marred by sin--God grant by regeneration restored in
   you--yet the original features of that image are still the original
   features of our human being. Without that image we would cease to be
   men.

   And, owing its origin to the impress of that original Image, our inward
   being draws toward It, naturally, urgently, and persistently. It can
   not live without it, and the fact that, on the other hand, the original
   Image of the Eternal One draws the impressed image in man to Himself,
   is the ultimate and constraining power of all prayer. However, to be
   exalted to the dignity of prayer, this drawing to God must not be like
   the involuntary suction of water to the deep, or the turning of the
   opening rose-bud toward the light. For the water knows not whither it
   is going, and the rosebud is unconscious of the sunshine which governs
   it. That almost irresistible drawing can be called prayer only when we
   know that it is prayer, when we perceive it, and, knowing to whom it
   draws us, make it our own conscious, cooperating act.

   Hence prayer does not spring from the will. The Triune God is He who
   rouses the soul to prayer, who draws us, and not we ourselves.
   Wherefore the Psalmist says: "When Thou saidst, Seek ye My face, my
   heart said unto Thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek." (Psalm xxvii. 8)
   And how does this first impulse from God reach us? Not externally as
   the wind, but internally in the heart. And knowing that it does not
   proceed from me, but comes to me, it must be from the Holy Spirit who
   works in me. Are not all the internal impulses that proceed from the
   Eternal One the proper work of the Holy Spirit? We can have no
   fellowship with the Son but through the Holy Spirit; none with the
   Father but through the Son to whom the Holy Spirit has introduced us.

   However, we do not speak now of the state of regeneration. In our
   treatment of prayer thus far, we have reference to man in his original
   state, and independent of the restoration; and in that state we say,
   prayer is not the cry of an independent being for a God to him unknown,
   with whom he hopes thus to become acquainted; but, on the contrary,
   that all prayer presupposes, on man's part, an inward sense of the
   Eternal Being of God, and of the fact that, being created after His
   image, he belongs to Him and consciously draws to his original Image.
   Wherefore we may call it a spiritual magnetism, which operates
   unceasingly upon him, and originated in his creation. However, it is
   different from magnetism in a twofold aspect: (1) in that man is
   conscious of it; (2) in that it is a mutual attraction.

   The second point needs special emphasis. In magnetic attraction the
   magnet is active and the iron passive; but in prayer it is not so.
   Prayer rests upon the foundation of mutual attraction. So long as it
   proceeds from God's side alone, there is no prayer; but there is, when
   our being begins to draw to God, when we feel the impulse if possible
   to draw God to us: "Come, Lord, how long! Lord, delay not! come
   quickly!"

   This is the power of love which finds in prayer its most glorious
   manifestation. Prayer is the fairest flower that grows upon the stem of
   holy love. Then love works in God for man, on account of the image in
   which He created him. And in man love works for God, because of the
   Image after which he was created. In fact, every distress from which we
   cry to be delivered is to the soul but the conscious need of the power
   and faithfulness of God. So love labors to meet love, that in tranquil
   whisperings it may pray not for deliverance from trouble, but to
   possess Him for whose love alone the heart is yearning.

   Upon a lower level prayer certainly assumes a lower form, which by sin
   has become so low and selfish that prayer, which should be love's
   breath, has become an egoistic cry. But we discuss prayer as it was
   originally, before sin had affected it. And as the true heir of heaven
   yearns for his heavenly home not for the sake of crown and palm and
   golden harp, but for his God alone; so is prayer, pure and undefiled, a
   longing, not for God's gifts, but for God Himself. As the Shulamite
   calls for her bridegroom, so does the praying soul, from the consuming
   desire of love, pray and thirst for the possession of its Maker and to
   be possessed of Him.

   Since it is the Third Person in the Godhead who makes this communion
   between God and the soul possible, working and maintaining it in the
   soul, it is evident that prayer belongs to the proper domain of the
   Holy Spirit; only when thus considered can prayer be understood in its
   deepest significance.

   The other question now arises, regarding the work of the Holy Spirit in
   our prayer, after that we became sinners.

   For even sinners pray. This is evident from the heathen world, which,
   however low its forms of prayer, yet offers up supplications and
   petitions. It is evident from the ease with which a little child,
   taught by its mother, learns to pray; and from the many who, estranged
   from prayer, in sudden calamities bend the knees, and, altho they can
   not pray, still assume the attitude of prayer, willing to give half
   their kingdom if they only could pray. And lastly, it is evident from
   the thousands and tens of thousands who, convinced of the impossibility
   of praying for themselves, cry to others: "Pray for us!"

   Prayer in higher, holier sense the sinner can not offer. Everything in
   him is sinful, even his prayer. In his sin he has reversed the
   established order of things: not he existing for God, but God existing
   for him. Confirmed in his selfishness, the God of heaven and earth is
   to him little more than a Physician in every sickness and a Provider in
   every need; a wonderful Being, ever ready at his first cry to supply
   out of His fulness his every necessity.

   This is the egoism that inseparably belongs to every sinner's prayer.
   The prayer of the redeemed saint is: "Our Father, who art in heaven,
   hallowed be Thy name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it
   is in heaven. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory
   forever. Amen." The converted sinner offers first the petitions for His
   name, His Kingdom, and His will; then he adds the petitions for bread,
   for forgiveness, for protection from sin. But the unconverted sinner
   has no conception of a prayer for God's name, Kingdom, and will. He
   prays for bread only; for forgiveness also, but only from the motive
   that bread and luxury and deliverance from trouble may not be denied
   him.

   Wherefore it is impossible to have too low an estimate of the sinner's
   prayer. The depth of our fall is in nothing so apparent as in the sin
   of this degenerate, bastardized prayer. All such prayer may be
   designated as a defying and vexing of God and His eternal love. In this
   sense the prayer of the sinner contains nothing of the work of the Holy
   Spirit. All this prayer springs from the egoism of the sinful heart,
   and has not the least value, rather the opposite.

   But--and this is the principal thing--altho our hands have unstrung the
   harp so that it produces nothing but discord, yet the artist is just as
   great, for he had so planned and constructed and tuned the instrument
   that it could produce the purest tones and fairest music. And such is
   man's heart. Sin did not remove the strings, for then it could not
   produce even discord; but sin has put it out of tune, and now its tones
   are harsh and grating upon the ear. And yet these very strings testify
   of the work of the original Master, for by His original work they are
   still sound-producing. So long as the strings are only loose upon the
   harp, it may be repaired; but when they are altogether broken and gone,
   it is no longer a harp, but a useless piece of wood. Every prayer of
   the sinner is a discord which jars against the beautiful harmony of the
   eternal love of God; nevertheless the very discords of that prayer are
   the evidences that the Holy Spirit had originally placed the strings
   upon the heart.

   If the Holy Spirit had never performed such a work upon the heart,
   there would be no harp at all; the heart could not produce even the
   discord. The fact that it does, shows that there are strings which
   originally were perfectly attuned. Hence prayer in the sinner is
   unthinkable without the work of the Holy Spirit.

   But this is not all. Not only the possibility of such discordant
   prayer, but the discord itself is but the reversed working of a power
   created, supported, and actuated by the Holy Spirit's work. To put this
   in the strongest light, we add: that all cursing and blasphemy is the
   reversed action of a power of the Holy Spirit. Blasphemers and men
   given to profanity indulge in their terrible sin, because they realize
   that the Almighty God lives, and that His power is something terrible.
   Cursing and blasphemy are hellish tones and vibrations from the same
   harp of prayer, which the Holy Spirit created in the soul. An animal
   can not curse; and if the Holy Spirit had not strung the soul with
   these strings of prayer, no curse could ever have passed the lips of
   man. Cursing is a malignant boil, but it springs directly from the
   artery of prayer. Consider it well, even Satan has not a single power
   directly from himself; and all the power with which, in his blasphemous
   and insane rage, he wars against God is a power from God reversed by
   Satan.

   Even the sinner's prayer is a manifestation of power. There must be an
   impulse and incitement, however weak, which causes him to pray. And
   this requires strength of consciousness and an expression of the will.
   And these powers he does not create himself, but the Holy Ghost; he
   only abuses or corrupts them.

   When an unpractised hand touches the harp-strings and produces
   discords, it does not create those discords; but they are formed from
   the sounds and tones which are in the vibrating strings of the harp.
   The same is true of the sinner's prayer. He could not offer his sinful
   prayer if there were no tone of prayer in the strings of his heart.
   That he can pray at all, he owes to the fact that the Holy Spirit
   created the tones of payer in his heart; which he brings forth, alas!
   only to make them discords.

   However, in this respect, ordinary grace in its sometimes preparatory
   character ought not to be overlooked. The sinner is on earth, and not
   yet in hell. Between the two is, first, this difference, that on the
   former there is preventive grace, which bridles the power of sin and
   prevents it from breaking out in all its violence. Sin on earth is like
   a chained bulldog or a muzzled hyena. Secondly, God loves this world.
   He has thoughts of peace concerning it. He does not forsake the work of
   His creation, and by His sovereign grace He provides a redemption which
   saves the organism of the world and of the race; so that the tree is
   saved, while the useless shoots and dry leaves are gathered to be cast
   into hell. Having this is in view, ordinary or general grace aims at
   the preservation of the powers of the original creation, to develop
   them to some extent, and thus to prepare the field in which by and by
   the seed of eternal life will be planted., And, altho this ordinary
   grace is not effectual to salvation, any more than the mere plowing of
   the field can ever germinate the wheat which is not sown in the
   furrows, yet this plowing of ordinary grace has real significance for
   the future growth of the seed of eternal life.

   And in this general grace, the grace of prayer occupies an important
   place. If there were no general grace, muzzling sin and plowing the
   field, the sinner could no more pray than Satan, but like him would
   curse God without ceasing. But now he still prays, he has prayed for
   ages, and by his prayer, even tho it is the fruit of tradition, he has
   sometimes risen above the sinful egoism of his heart. But this prayer
   never sprang from the root of sin, nor from something good which he had
   kept along with sin in the holy closet of his heart; it was but the
   gracious work of the Holy Spirit.

   Evidence of the deep inworking of this grace is found in the exalted
   devotions that still sound in our ears from the most ancient
   traditional prayers of Indian, Egyptian, and Greek antiquity; and in
   the ministry of prayer from the pulpit by unconverted ministers whose
   supplications often move and touch the soul.

   However, the glory of this does not belong to the sinner; nor does it
   in the least affect the absolute character of man's depravity by sin.
   But it shows that the Lord God did not leave the sinner to his sin; but
   even in the absence of regeneration, and to the glory of His name,
   caused general grace to intervene, which frequently illuminated the
   life of prayer.

   And when such a people, still acquainted with these holy traditions and
   gracious operations, received the knowledge of Christ crucified and of
   His power to save, it became evident afterward that the prayers which,
   independently of himself, were laid upon the sinner's lips had prepared
   a way and opened a gate through which the King of Glory could come into
   such a people. And taking it in individual cases, it appears from the
   experience of many that, long before the soul became conscious of
   saving grace, the grace of God not only kept him from violent outbreaks
   of sin, but, through the tradition of prayer, wrought a work in him the
   blessed effects of which were understood only long afterward.

   And all these operations of general grace are, as soon as they touch
   the life of prayer, the work of the Holy Spirit. He who in creation
   strung the harp of prayer in the soul is the same who causes not only
   the tone of prayer to vibrate even in our egoistic petitions, but who,
   in a more glorious way, sometimes even as tho the soul were an Ã†olian
   harp, touches the strings with the breath of His mouth, and draws from
   it the beautiful and entrancing tones of prayers and supplications.

  XLII.

  The Prayer of the Regenerated.

   "Likewise the Spirit helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we
   should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession
   for us with groanings which can not be uttered." --Rom. viii. 26.

   Next in order comes the question: What is the work of the Holy Spirit
   in the prayer of the regenerated?

   Here we distinguish (1) the prayer of the saint, and (2) that of the
   Holy Spirit for him.

   The last we consider first, because, through the Apostle Paul, we
   receive clearest revelation concerning it: "Likewise the Spirit helpeth
   our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought;
   but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that
   can not be uttered" (Rom. viii. 26). For the better understanding of
   this passage, observe:

   In the first place, that the apostle refers to the prayer or groan
   arising not from the regenerated person himself, but from another in
   his behalf. It is not a prayer, but an intercession from the Holy
   Spirit for him." [39]

   In the second place, it is necessary to distinguish between the
   intercession of the Holy Spirit and of Jesus Christ the Righteous.

   Christ intercedes for us in heaven, and the Holy Spirit on earth.
   Christ our Holy Head, being absent from us, intercedes outside of us;
   the Holy Spirit our Comforter intercedes in our own heart which He has
   chosen as His temple.

   There is a difference, not only of place, but also in the nature of
   this twofold intercession. The glorified Christ intercedes in heaven
   for His elect and redeemed, to obtain for them the fruit of His
   sacrifice: "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the Righteous" (1 John ii. i). But the object of the Holy
   Spirit's petitions is the laying bare of all the deep and hidden needs
   of the saints before the eye of the Triune God.

   In Christ there is a union of God and man, since, being in the form of
   God, He took upon Himself the human nature. Hence His prayer is that of
   the Son of God, but in union with the nature of man. He prays as the
   Head of the new race, as King of His people, as the one that seals the
   covenant of the New Testament in His blood. In like manner, there is to
   some extent a union between God and man, when the Holy Spirit prays for
   the saints. For, by His indwelling in the hearts of the saints, He has
   established a lasting and most intimate union, and by virtue of that
   union putting Himself in their place, He prays for them and in their
   stead.

   In each instance there is intercession, but in each in a different
   manner. In his priestly capacity, as head of the family, the father
   prays for his family not because the members could not offer similar
   prayer, but on account of his calling as their head to represent them
   before God. All pray, but he as their head prays for them all. And
   thus, as the Head of the Body, it is the calling of Christ to pray for
   the Body. Tho their prayer were perfect, His prayer would still be
   needed. All the members must pray, but He must pray for them all.
   Entirely different, however, is the prayer of the mother for her dying
   child. Being only five or six years old, the little one can scarcely
   pray for himself. He has not the slightest conception of what is
   happening to him, nor of his own needs. Then his mother kneels by his
   side and prays for him, "helping his infirmities, for he knoweth not
   what to pray for as he ought." If he were twenty years older, there
   would be no need of it; he himself could understand his condition and
   pray for himself. And this applies to the intercession of the Holy
   Ghost. If the saint were what he ought to be, and could pray as he
   ought, there would be no need of this intercession. But, being
   imperfect and beset by weaknesses, not knowing what to pray for, the
   Holy Spirit helpeth his infirmities, and prays for him.

   Christ intercedes for the body because He is the Head; even tho the
   prayers of the members were perfect and mature, He would still
   intercede with the Father in their behalf. But the Holy Spirit prays
   because the prayers of the saints are imperfect, immature, and
   insufficient. His prayer is, complementary and necessary, inasmuch as
   the saint can not yet pray as he ought; hence decreasing as the saint
   learns to pray more and more correctly.

   The intercession of the Holy Spirit is according to the saint's
   condition, which is described in the seventh chapter of Romans. Surely,
   the Lord God might have been pleased to regenerate the sinner in such a
   way as to deliver him at once and completely from sin, and from all the
   after-effects of his old nature; but He has ordained it otherwise.
   Regeneration does not effect such a sudden change. It does indeed
   change his state before God at once and completely, but it does not
   place him at once in a condition of perfect holiness. On the contrary,
   after regeneration it remains, on the one hand, "I delight in the law
   of God after the inward man" (Rom. vii. 22; but also, on the other, "I
   see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind."
   (Rom. vii. 23) Hence the cry: "O wretched man that I am, who shall
   deliver me from the body of this death?" (Rom. vii. 24)

   And the intercession of the Holy Spirit fully meets this condition. If
   in regeneration we became perfectly holy, without any infirmity, with
   perfect knowledge what we should pray for, there would be no need of
   this intercession. But, this not being so, the Holy Spirit comes to
   help our infirmities, in us to pray for us, as tho it were our own
   prayer.

   This last point must be emphasized. The Holy Spirit prays for men
   called saints; and it must be maintained that every regenerated person
   is a saint, his infirmities notwithstanding: a saint, not for what he
   is in himself, but because of the word of Christ: "Thou art Mine." And
   these two conditions, (1) of being a saint, and (2) still unholy in
   himself, can not remain unreconciled. Wherefore the Sacred Scripture
   teaches that, altho we lie in the midst of death, yet in Christ we are
   holy; hence we have a holiness, yet not in us, but outside of us in
   Christ Jesus. "Our Life is hid with Christ in God." And the same
   applies to our prayers. We are saints not only in name, but in deed.
   And therefore the prayers that ascend to the mercy-seat from our hearts
   must be holy prayers. It is the sweet incense of the prayers of the
   saints. But being unable of ourselves to kindle the incense, the Holy
   Spirit helps our infirmities, and from our hearts prays to God in our
   behalf. We are not conscious of it; He prays for and in us with groans
   that can not be uttered; which does not mean that He makes us utter
   groans for which we can not account, but that He groans in us with
   affections and emotions which may comfort us, but which have nothing in
   common with the sighing of our respiratory organs. This is clear from
   verse 27, where St. Paul declares, that He that searcheth the hearts,
   knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit.

   Apart from the intercession of the Holy Spirit in our behalf there is
   also a work of His Person in our own prayers.

   The proportion between these two operations is different according to
   our different conditions. The child, regenerated in the cradle and
   deceased before conversion was possible, could not pray for himself;
   the Holy Spirit prayed therefore for and in him with groans that can
   not be uttered. But if the child had lived and was converted at a later
   age, it would first have been the prayer of the Holy Spirit alone; and
   after his conversion his own prayers would have been added. And, even
   after his conversion, he may become indifferent and fall into a
   temporary apostasy, so that his own prayer fails altogether; yet the
   prayer of the Holy Spirit in him never fails.

   Finally, according to the measure of his spiritual growth, his progress
   in prayer will be either slow or rapid. The Holy Spirit prays in us as
   long and in as much as we can not pray for ourselves; but at the same
   time He teaches us to pray, that gradually His prayer may become
   superfluous. This includes that when temptations threaten us of which
   we are ignorant, or we are in the midst of assaults and conflicts which
   we fail to understand, the Holy Spirit immediately renews His prayer,
   and cries unto God in our behalf.

   But this should not be understood as tho the Holy Spirit teaches us to
   pray, that He may withdraw Himself altogether from our prayers. On the
   contrary, every prayer of the saint must be in communion with the Holy
   Spirit. In order to be more earnest in prayer we must sustain a more
   intimate communion. The more we pray alone and of ourselves, the more
   our prayer degenerates into a sinful prayer, and ceases to be the
   prayer of a child of God. Wherefore St. Jude admonishes us to pray in
   the Spirit.

   There is only this difference: when the Holy Spirit prays for us, He
   prays independently of us, altho in our own heart; but when we have
   learned to pray, altho the Holy Spirit continues to be the real
   Petitioner, yet He prays with us and through us, and cries unto God
   from our lips. As a mother first prays for her child without his
   knowledge, and then teaches him to pray that by and by she may pray
   with him, so also is the work of the Holy Spirit. He begins with
   praying for us; then He teaches us to pray; and when we have made some
   progress in the school of prayer, then He begins to pray with us not
   only in us, but through us. This is the Spirit of adoption, by whom we
   cry "Abba, Father"; but in such a way that at the same moment He
   testifies with our spirits that we are the children of God.

   For this reason the Lord said to the woman of Samaria: "The hour cometh
   and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in Spirit
   and in truth." (John iv. 23) The addition "in truth" had reference to
   the symbolic service of ceremonies in Israel. The land of Canaan was
   the type of heaven, Jerusalem of the inner sanctuary, and Zion was the
   throne of God; the bloody sacrifices of ram and heifer signified the
   remission of sin; the altar of incense was symbol of the prayers of the
   saints. All this was truly typical, but it was not the truth itself.
   Jerusalem was not the sanctuary of the Lord Jehovah, and Zion was not
   the mercy-seat. The truth of all this was and is in the heaven of
   heavens, and thus truth and grace came by Jesus Christ, even as its
   symbol and shadow had come by the law of Moses. After the coming of
   Christ, the prayers of the saints were to be separated from Jerusalem;
   wherefore Jesus said to the woman: "Jerusalem and Gerizim are out of
   the question; they belong to the dispensation of shadows; and that
   dispensation ceased with My coming into the world. Henceforth there
   will be no more worship in shadows; but a worship of the Father in
   actuality and in truth." And this gives us the true interpretation of
   the addition: "in Spirit." So long as the people depended upon the
   service of shadows, they looked upon external things as supports of
   their prayers. But, since it was to be a worship in truth, it needed
   the inward support which the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, offered them.

   The saint is a saint because he received the Holy Spirit, who took up
   His abode with him and inwardly married Himself to the soul. Every
   vital utterance proceeding from him, apart from the Holy Spirit in him,
   is foreign to his sonship and is sin. Only in so far as he is moved and
   operated upon by the indwelling Spirit are his thoughts, words, and
   deeds the utterances of the child of God in him.

   And if this is true of the whole domain of his life, how much more of
   his life of prayer? After his conversion he often prays of himself
   apart from the Holy Spirit; but that is the prayer, not of God's child,
   but of the old sinner. But when the communion of the Holy Spirit is
   active in his heart, and works in him both the impulse and the
   animation of his prayer, then it is truly the prayer of the child of
   God, because wrought in him by the Holy Spirit.

   Wherefore Zacharias combines the Spirit of grace and of supplication.
   It is the same Spirit who, entering our hearts, unlocks unto us the
   grace of God, enriches us with that grace, teaches us to realize that
   grace, and at the same time causes our thirst for that grace to utter
   itself in prayer. Prayer is the cry for grace, and can not be uttered
   until the Holy Spirit presents to the spiritual eye the riches of grace
   which are in Christ Jesus. And, on the other hand, the Holy Spirit can
   not cause these riches of grace to scintillate before the eye of the
   soul without creating in us thirst and longing desire for this grace;
   thus compelling us to pray.

   Or, to put it more comprehensively, the prayer of the saint requires
   three things:

   First, an insight into the riches of eternal redemption.

   Second, vivid impressions of his spiritual deadness and distress.

   Lastly, the earnest desire for lively fellowship with the unsearchable
   treasures of divine grace.

   And how can the holy presence of the Lord Jehovah be revealed to him in
   peace but by the Holy Spirit, entering into his heart? And how can he
   have a vivid realization of his spiritual distress except the Holy
   Spirit reveal it to him? And how shall he be so bold, out of that
   distress, to cry unto God in the fellowship of love except the Holy
   Spirit create boldness and confidence in his soul?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] Expositors of an earlier period judged with Calvin that the
   intercession of the Holy Spirit signified a working upon us, by virtue
   of which we ourselves groaned in ourselves. But this view is incorrect;
   for verse 23 states what Calvin supposed to be stated in verse 26. In
   the former, the apostle speaks of groanings that proceed from us,
   wrought in us by the Holy Spirit. Verse 26 can not be a mere
   repetition; for the word "likewise" introduces a new thing, altho it is
   similar to the preceding. Moreover, the word here applied to the Holy
   Spirit is the same as the one used in verse 34, "entunchÃ¡nein," which
   signifies the intercession of the Holy Spirit. And again, the word
   "sunantilambÃ¡nesthai," which is translated "to help," requires that the
   person rendering assistance be not only in us, but also works with us
   and for us. Verse 27 leads to the same conclusion, first, because it
   speaks of the mind of the Spirit, and not of man's mind; secondly,
   because the intercession is said to be according to God, "katÃ  TheÃ³n,"
   not "eÃ¬s TheÃ³n," i.e., according to the will of God, and this can be
   said of the Holy Spirit alone. We do not, however, deny that, in one
   respect, this groaning makes instrumental use of the vocal organs, as
   in the matter of the "glÃ³ssais lalein," the speaking with tongues. We
   maintain only that the unutterable groaning does not imply the use of
   those organs; rather the opposite.

  XLIII.

  Prayer for and with Each Other.

   "Confess your faults one to another and pray one for another, that ye
   may be healed. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man
   availeth much."--James v. 16.

   Let our last article touch once more the key of love wherein the
   article preceding that of prayer was set. To speak of the Spirit's work
   in our prayers, omitting the intercession of the saints, betrays a lack
   of understanding concerning the Spirit of all grace.

   Prayer for others is quite different from prayer for ourselves. The
   latter is indeed lawful; God even commands us "in everything by prayer
   and supplication with thanksgiving to make our requests known unto
   God." Yet it may contain refined egoism even tho it be followed by
   thanksgiving; hence to prayer is added intercession, that in prayer the
   breath of love may quench gently, yet effectually, remaining egoism,
   and lead us to the still holier prayer for the heavenly King and His
   Kingdom.

   Christ prays for us, but the Bride must also pray for her heavenly
   Bridegroom. David's prayer for Solomon points beyond Solomon to the
   Messiah: "Give the King Thy judgments, O God" (Psalm lxxii. 1). In the
   Twentieth and Sixty-first Psalms the same thought is expressed.
   However, this is not a prayer for His Person (for as such He is
   glorified already), but for the coming of His Kingdom, for the
   extending of His Name to the ends of the earth, for the gathering in of
   the souls of His elect.

   In the Lord's Prayer, this most holy petition stands even in the
   foreground; for when we pray, "Hallowed be Thy name, Thy Kingdom come,
   Thy will be done," (Luke xi. 2) we are inspired, not by love for self
   or for others, but by love for Him who is in heaven. It is true, we
   realize that the fulfilling of that prayer is most desirable for others
   and ourselves; still it is the love for God that stands here in the
   foreground. It is the summary of prayer eminently fitting the summary
   of the law: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God." (Matt. xxii. 37) This
   is the first and great commandment. Then, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor
   as thyself." (Matt. xxii. 39) And so in our prayer: first, for the
   cause of God, this is the first and great petition; then, prayer for
   the neighbor as for ourselves. Our prayer is the test of our relation
   to the first and great commandment.

   And what is the work of the Holy Spirit in the prayer of intercession?

   It is necessary here, for a clear understanding, to distinguish between
   a twofold intercession: (1) there is a prayer for the things that
   pertain to the body of Christ; and (2) another for the things that do
   not belong to that body, according to our impression and conception of
   the matter.

   Prayer for kings, and for all that are in authority, does not concern
   the things that pertain to the body of Christ; neither does the prayer
   for our enemies, nor that for the place of our habitation, for country,
   army, and navy, for a bountiful harvest, for deliverance from
   pestilence, for trade and commerce, etc. All these pertain to the
   natural life, and to persons, whether saints or sinners, in their
   relation to the life of creation, and not to the Kingdom of Grace. But
   our prayer does concern the body of Christ, when we pray for the coming
   of the Lord, for a fresh anointing of the priests of God, for their
   being clothed upon with salvation, for success in the work of missions,
   for a baptism of the Holy Spirit, for strength in conflict, for
   forgiveness of sin, for the salvation of our loved ones, for the
   effectual conversion of the baptized seed of the Church. The first
   intercession has reference to the realm of nature, the second to the
   Kingdom of Grace. Hence in each of these two we must look for the bond
   of fellowship from which springs our prayer of intercession.

   For every prayer of intercession presupposes fellowship with them for
   whom we pray; a fellowship which casts us into the same distress, and
   from which we look for deliverance, and that in such a way that the
   sorrow of one burdens us, and the joy of another causes us to give
   thanks. Where such vital fellowship does not exist, nor the love which
   springs from it, or where these are temporarily inactive, there may be
   a formal intercession of words, but real intercession from the heart
   there can not be.

   With reference to the intercession in the realm of nature, the ground
   of this fellowship is naturally found in the fact that we are created
   of one blood. Humanity is one. The nations form an organic whole. It is
   a mighty trunk with leafy crown; the nations and peoples are the
   branches thereof, successive generations the boughs, and each of us is
   a fluttering leaf. Belonging together, living together upon the same
   root of our human nature, it is one flesh and one blood, which from
   Adam to the last-born child covers every skeleton and runs through
   every man's veins. Hence the desire for universal philanthropy; the
   claim that nothing be alien to us that is human; the necessity of
   loving our enemy and of praying for him, for he also is of our flesh
   and of our bones.

   If we were like grains in a heap of sand, each grain might possibly
   send forth a sigh; but the mutual prayer of intercession would be out
   of the question. Being leaves, however, of the same tree of life, there
   is, apart from the groaning of every leaf, also a prayer for one
   another, a mutual prayer of the entire human life; "the whole creation
   groaneth."

   But in the Kingdom of Grace the fellowship of love is much stronger,
   firmer, and more intimate. There is here also an organic whole, even
   the body of Christ under Him the Head. It is not one converted person
   independent of another, and the two united by a mere outward tie of
   sympathy; nay, but a multitude of branches all springing from the same
   root of Jesse; growing from the one vine; all organically one; saved
   and redeemed by the same ransom of His blood; proceeding from the one
   act of election; born again by the self-same regeneration; brought nigh
   by the same faith; breaking one bread and drinking from one cup.

   And let us notice it well, this unity is doubly strong; for it is not
   independent of the fellowship of nature, but added to it. They who
   become members of the body of Christ are with us created from the one
   blood of Adam, and with us they are redeemed by the one blood of
   Christ. Hence there is here double root of fellowship. Flesh of our
   flesh, bones of our bones. Moreover, born from one decree; sealed by
   one baptism; joined together in one body; included in one promise; by
   and by sharers with us of the same inheritance.

   In this double fellowship of life is rooted the love which mutually
   unites the children of God, especially in their prayers of
   intercession, a union which appears sometimes in their mutual prayer.
   Vital fellowship does not spring from our love for the people of God,
   but that love springs from the fellowship of the life of grace, common
   to all His saints. That which grows not from one root, and, therefore,
   shares not the same life, can not attain to love in higher sense.
   Prayer for one another is born of the love to one another; and the love
   which unites us ascends from the one root of life upon which we all are
   grafted through grace, upon which by virtue of our creation from Adam
   we all were set. And thus the work of the Holy Spirit in the prayer of
   intercession will appear in clearest light.

   In the realm of nature, our vital power is from the Father, our human
   kinship through the Son, and the conception of that kinship from the
   Holy Ghost. Hence in the ordinary manifestations of benevolence, such
   as helpfulness in distress, friendliness in daily life, and the desire
   for social intercourse, it is the work of the Holy Spirit to keep alive
   in us the conception of our human kinship. It is true that sin has
   terribly disturbed this conception. Yet the Holy Spirit has not
   forsaken His work; but, when a man seeing a strange child drowning,
   and, without considering his own life, jumps into the water and saves
   him, then it is the constraining power of the Holy Spirit that must be
   honored in this heroic act of philanthropy.

   But much more apparent is the work of the Holy Spirit in the prayer of
   intercession which belongs to the domain of grace. For with reference
   to the fellowship of the body of Christ, it is again the Father from
   whom proceeds our redemption, the Son in whom we are united, and the
   Holy Spirit who imparts to us the conception and consciousness of this
   unity and holy fellowship. The mere fact of being chosen by the Father
   and redeemed by the Son does not constrain us to love; it is the act of
   the Holy Spirit, who, revealing to our conception and consciousness
   this wonderful gift of grace, opening our eyes for the beauty of being
   joined to the body of Christ, kindles in us the spark of the love for
   Christ and for His people. And when this double work of the Holy Spirit
   effectually operates in us, causing our hearts to be drawn to all that
   belong to us by virtue of our human kinship, and much more strongly to
   the people of God by virtue of our kinship in the Son, then there
   awakes in us the love of which the apostle says that it is shed abroad
   in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.

   And yet this is not all of the Holy Spirit's work. Love can be tender
   without compelling one to prayer. This is evident from the universal
   love of benevolence. A man may rush into a burning building to save
   another from perishing by fire, while he is a perfect stranger to
   prayer for others. And, on the contrary, there are people who always
   talk of praying for others, who constantly enlarge the phylacteries of
   their own prayer of intercession, who ever say to others, "Pray for
   me," and who would yet, in the hour of danger, quietly allow us to
   drown or perish in the flames; who carefully guard their pockets lest
   mercy call upon them to assist us with their money.

   From which it is evident that there must be a connecting link between
   love and the prayer born of love. As soon as love begins to pray it is
   joined to faith; and by this union prayer becomes active. Love alone is
   not yet prayer. And the mere prayer of intercession is not the evidence
   of love. Then alone is there real intercession, when love, being joined
   to faith, constrains us to carry the object of love before the throne
   of grace.

   Let us, therefore, be careful in our prayers of intercession;
   especially when the person for whom we pray is present. For then there
   is danger lest our prayer in his behalf have the tendency to show him
   how much we think of him and love him, rather than constrain us to ask
   something for him of God. Methodism [40] has often sinned in this
   respect, and many a prayer has been desecrated by this insincere
   intercession.

   This shows clearly what is the additional work of the Holy Spirit in
   this respect: not merely that He quicken in us general faith, nor that
   He fan in us the flames of brotherly love; but that He also cause faith
   to join love in holy wedlock, directing them thus united to the brother
   for whom we are to pray. This is the object of St. Paul, when he
   desires that there shall be a fellowship of saints, not only in the
   gift of God, but also in the prayer of thanksgiving; not only for our
   sakes, but "That the abounding grace might through the thanksgiving of
   many rebound to the glory of God" (1 Cor. iv. 15).

   Just as in a drawing-room whose walls are lined with crystal mirrors
   the light of the chandelier is reflected not only by every mirror, but
   also from mirror to mirror, so that there is an endless reflection of
   the light, so also is it with reference to the prayer of intercession
   and thanksgiving in the body of Christ. In this chamber of glory Christ
   is the Light which is reflected in the mirror of the soul. But it is
   not sufficient that every soul-mirror receive the light, and reflect it
   in thanksgiving; but from mirror to mirror this glory of the Son must
   be reflected here or there until there is an never-ending scintillation
   of increasing brightness; and everything is baptized in the overflowing
   luster in which the Son glorifies Himself.

   And this leads us to speak of mutual prayer.

   Mutual prayer is intercession of the richest sort; for its value is
   enhanced by the consciousness of its being mutual. In ordinary
   intercession, one prays for another not knowing whether the other also
   prays for him, but in the mutual prayer, "I " is turned into "we," as
   in the Lord's Prayer. It is no longer one wrestling before the throne
   of grace, but all together, thus giving expression to the unity and
   fellowship of the body of Christ. They cry from one distress; they
   bless Him for the same grace; they plead the same promise; they look
   forward to the same glory; they come to the same Father in the name of
   the one Mediator, leaning upon the same atoning blood. Then it is that
   the work of the Holy Spirit attains its highest glory. Then He joins
   faith and love, not in one heart, but in many; then He opens the hearts
   and unites the souls of the saints; then He causes them to meet
   together in the audience-chamber of the Lord God, one people, a
   multitude of believers, who in their spiritual kinship reflect the
   unity of the body of Christ.

   Hence there is nothing so difficult as mutual prayer. Prayer in the
   closet is easy; to pray for others is not hard; but to pray with each
   other requires such exalted spiritual tone, such pure love, such clear
   perception of the unity of the body, as, alas! in the midst of this
   sinful life is rarely attained by large bodies of believers. And the
   leader, if he be indeed the mouthpiece of the people, has a very
   difficult task, and must himself be in a thoroughly spiritual frame of
   mind.

   Surely if the Holy Spirit left us to ourselves, every activity of
   faith, love, and prayer would soon be paralyzed. But, blessed be God!
   He knows our infirmity, and with divine pity He looks upon our painful
   helplessness. He is and remains the Comforter; His work is never ended.
   When we slept, having no oil in our lamps, He watched over our souls.
   When our love failed, He loved us just the same. When our faith became
   dull and faint, and prayer became dumb upon our lips, He prayed for us
   with groanings that can not be uttered.

   And this is His work continually. It is He that is the divine Bearer of
   every higher conception and holier consciousness in the children of
   men; He, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, that exhibits all the
   riches of the Mediator to the Bride, making her eager to possess them;
   He that quickens the treasures of the Word by the spark of His holy
   fire, bringing them to the consciousness of the inward man.

   Blessed is the man to whom has been given a taste of the work of the
   Holy Spirit in his own experience. Blessed is the Church which in its
   service has proved the inworking of the Spirit of grace and of
   supplication. Blessed is he who, constrained to love by the love of the
   Holy Spirit, has opened his heart in thanks, praise, and adoration, not
   only to the Father who from eternity has chosen and called him, and to
   the Son who has bought and redeemed him, but also to the Third Person
   in the Holy Trinity, who has kindled in him the light and keeps it
   burning in the inward darkness; to whom, therefore, with the Father and
   the Son, belongs forever the sacrifice of love and devotion of all the
   Church of God.
